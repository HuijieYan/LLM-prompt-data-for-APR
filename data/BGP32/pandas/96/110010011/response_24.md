### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in class `BusinessHourMixin` is supposed to adjust the given datetime based on business hours, but it seems to be producing unexpected results leading to `ValueError` during the validation of frequency.
2. The error message describes the issue occurring when trying to validate the frequency for a custom business hour offset.
3. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem related to the behavior of `date_range` with custom business hour frequency and holidays, leading to more periods being generated than expected. This aligns with the situation where the buggy function is applied in frequency validation.
4. The bug might be related to how the business hours are calculated and adjusted in the `apply` function, which could lead to incorrect frequency validation.
   
### Bug Cause:
The likely cause of the bug is the incorrect adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function when handling positive and negative business hours. This incorrect adjustment may lead to an incorrect number of periods being generated, causing a discrepancy in the validation of the frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function is correctly implemented to align with the expected behavior. Specifically, the logic for adjusting dates when calculating business hours should be revised to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        adjusted_time = other
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            if n >= 0:
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
            else:
                adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on ensuring the adjustment of time according to positive and negative business hours by iteratively moving to the next or previous opening time based on the business hour offset, thus avoiding the previous discrepancies.
