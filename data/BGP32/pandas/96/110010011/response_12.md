### Analysis:
- The buggy function identified is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring during frequency validation for a Datetime Index.
- The reported Issue on GitHub highlights a problem with `pd.date_range` when adding holidays and using periods with custom business hours.
- The incorrect behavior is generating more than the specified number of periods.

### Error Location:
- The issue lies within the `apply` function where offsets are not applied correctly when combined with periods and holidays.

### Cause of Bug:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the offsets when combining business hours, periods, and holidays. This leads to additional periods being added due to misalignment in the calculations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix involves ensuring that the custom business hours, periods, and holidays are correctly applied and adjusted during the date range generation process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, (date, datetime)):
            other = as_datetime(other)

        n = self.n

        start_dt = other
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                start_dt += self
                if start_dt in self or not self._is_on_offset(start_dt):
                    start_dt = self._next_opening_time(start_dt)
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if start_dt.time() in self.start or start_dt.time() in self.end:
                    start_dt = self._adjust_previous_day(start_dt)
                if start_dt in self or not self._is_on_offset(start_dt):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(start_dt)
                    start_dt = self._get_closing_time(prev_open)
                    n += 1

        return start_dt

    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments in the logic for applying custom business hours with periods and holidays, ensuring the date range generation is aligned correctly.
