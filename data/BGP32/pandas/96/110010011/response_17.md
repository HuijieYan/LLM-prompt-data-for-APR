### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation.
3. The GitHub issue describes a problem with `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, which leads to an unexpected number of periods.
4. The bug seems to occur when applying a custom business hour frequency with holidays using the `pd.date_range` function.
5. The current implementation of the `apply` function leads to an issue with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency, resulting in a `ValueError`.
6. To fix the bug, the issue with the frequency validation needs to be addressed in a way that ensures the inferred frequency matches the provided frequency, especially when adding holidays.

### Bug Fix:
1. The buggy function needs to be modified to correctly adjust for holidays while maintaining the expected number of periods.
2. By updating how the function handles offset adjustments with holidays, we can align the inferred frequency with the passed frequency.
3. Additional checks for holidays and adjustments should be made to account for the number of periods correctly.
4. We can modify the logic for adjusting business hours to handle holidays more accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # business hour adjustments with holidays
            if hasattr(self, "holidays") and other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            original_other = other
            
            n = self.n
            while n < 0 and (other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            while n >= 0 and (other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle holidays properly while validating the frequency, matching the expected behavior for custom business hour frequencies with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
