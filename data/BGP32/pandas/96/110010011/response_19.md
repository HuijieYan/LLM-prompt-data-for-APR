### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which belongs to the `pandas` library.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` while validating the frequency for a `DatetimeIndex` using a custom frequency for business hours.
3. The Github issue reports an inconsistency when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays, leading to incorrect output.
4. The bug causes an issue in generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.
5. The error message mentions that the inferred frequency is `None` which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the custom business offset with holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date range due to improper frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the custom business offset with holidays is appropriately considered when generating the date range.
2. Modify the `_validate_frequency` method to handle custom business frequencies with holidays more accurately.
3. Verify that the frequency is properly validated to match the inferred frequency from the passed values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_other = other
        while n != 0:
            adjusted_other = self.rollforward(adjusted_other)
            n = n - 1 if n > 0 else n + 1
        
        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version simplifies the logic by using the `rollforward` method to adjust the datetime according to the business hours. It aligns the datetime based on the business hours without unnecessary complex calculations, potentially resolving the issue encountered with the incorrect number of periods in date ranges with holidays.
