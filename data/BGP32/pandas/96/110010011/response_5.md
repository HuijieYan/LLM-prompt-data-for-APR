### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is buggy.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised when validating a frequency.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue reports a problem with `pd.date_range` producing more periods than expected when holidays are added.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Date adjustment logic based on business hours.
2. Handling of positive and negative business hour cases.
3. Adjustment of remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` method when dealing with business hour offsets combined with datetime objects. This results in unexpected behavior in the frequency validation during date range creation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate handling of positive and negative business hours.
2. Correctly adjust remaining business hours within each business time interval.
3. Validate frequencies properly to prevent the `ValueError` during testing.

### Correction for the Buggy Function:
Below is a corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class based on the identified issues:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle nanosecond attribute
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # carry out necessary adjustments
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate total business hours in a day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues causing the unexpected behavior and the `ValueError` during frequency validation. It should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
