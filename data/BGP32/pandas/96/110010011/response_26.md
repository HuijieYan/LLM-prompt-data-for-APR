### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply()` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class.
3. The issue reported on GitHub involves the `pd.date_range` function not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays. The example provided leads to unexpected behavior.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles adjustments based on business hours, resulting in incorrect date ranges when holidays are introduced during periods of CustomBusinessHour.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix strategy involves updating the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust for business hours in the presence of holidays. This will ensure that the expected date ranges are generated without inconsistencies attributed to holiday interruptions.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if other is datetime
            if self.on_offset(other):
                if other.time() not in self.rule:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            if self.n > 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.rule:
                    other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            total_business_hours_sec = sum(self._get_offset_in_seconds(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.rule))
            abs_n = abs(self.n)
            business_days, remain_seconds = divmod(abs_n * self.minutes_per_business_hour, total_business_hours_sec // 3600)
            if self.n < 0:
                business_days, remain_seconds = -business_days, -remain_seconds
    
            if business_days != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=business_days) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=business_days)
    
            remaining_business_hours = timedelta(seconds=remain_seconds)
    
            if self.n > 0:
                while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
                    remaining_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if remaining_business_hours < remaining_hour:
                        other += remaining_business_hours
                        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= remaining_hour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_hour)
            else:
                while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
                    remaining_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (remaining_business_hours > remaining_hour) or (remaining_business_hours == remaining_hour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += remaining_business_hours
                        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= remaining_hour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_hour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By updating the logic inside the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, the bug should be fixed, and the `pd.date_range` function should work correctly with periods and holidays.
