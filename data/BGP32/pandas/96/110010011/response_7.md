### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The error message indicates that the validation of frequency for a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom frequency (`CBH` custom business hour) fails, leading to a `ValueError`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar issue where using periods and holidays together in `pd.date_range` results in more than the expected number of periods due to a frequency inference error.
4. The bug seems to be related to frequency validation and handling when holidays are involved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method, leading to erroneous generation of datetime periods in certain cases such as when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation correctly handles custom frequencies with holidays. Updating the frequency validation logic to correctly infer and match frequencies should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not self.on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
        total_hours_in_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

        n = self.n
        total_hours = abs(n) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_hours, total_hours_in_day // 60)
        r_minutes = timedelta(minutes=abs(r))

        if n < 0:
            bd, r_minutes = -bd, -r_minutes

        business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other += business_day_offset
        while r_minutes:
            current_end = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other)
            bhour = current_end - other if n >= 0 else other - current_end + timedelta(seconds=1)
            if r_minutes >= bhour:
                other = current_end
                r_minutes -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                other += r_minutes
                r_minutes = timedelta(0)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the frequency validation issue and ensure the correct generation of business hours when holidays are involved in the custom business frequency logic.
