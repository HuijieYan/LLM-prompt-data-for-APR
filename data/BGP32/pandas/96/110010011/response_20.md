### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas library.
2. The bug is causing a ValueError during frequency validation in date_range when using custom business hours.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency due to a ValueError.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business hours and handling of holidays.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem when using `periods` and adding holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is not properly handling the adjustment of business hours in the presence of holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated. This causes a mismatch in frequencies, resulting in a ValueError during frequency validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of business hours properly takes into account the presence of holidays.
2. Make sure that the validation of frequencies is accurate when holidays are involved.
3. Refactor the logic to handle business hour adjustments and holiday considerations correctly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), self._get_business_day_seconds())
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            other = self._handle_business_days(other, bd)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            other = self._adjust_business_hours(other, bhour_remain, n)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _handle_business_days(self, other, bd):
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        return other

    def _adjust_business_hours(self, other, bhour_remain, n):
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                other = self._handle_positive_adjustment(other, bhour_remain)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                other = self._handle_negative_adjustment(other, bhour_remain)
        return other

    def _handle_positive_adjustment(self, other, bhour_remain):
        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
        if bhour_remain < bhour:
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        return other

    def _handle_negative_adjustment(self, other, bhour_remain):
        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
        if bhour_remain >= bhour:
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
        return other
```

In the corrected version, I have split the business day handling and business hour adjustment logic into separate methods to improve clarity and ensure correct handling of holiday adjustments. The adjustment of business days and business hours is now handled more accurately to fix the bug causing the ValueError.
