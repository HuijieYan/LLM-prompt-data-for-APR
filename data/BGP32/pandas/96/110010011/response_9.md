### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, extending `BusinessMixin`. The function is responsible for adjusting a given datetime object based on business hour offsets. The bug triggers a `ValueError` when validating the frequency for a `DatetimeIndex` with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency involved.
   
2. The potential error locations in the function are the calculations and adjustments related to business hours, offset adjustments, and handling positive/negative cases based on business days.
   
3. The bug occurs due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency (`CBH`). The function tries to validate the frequency, and if the 'inferred' frequency does not match the passed frequency string, a `ValueError` is raised indicating the discrepancy.
   
4. To fix the bug, a strategy involves ensuring that the inferred frequency aligns with the expected frequency string (`CBH`). This requires checking and adjusting the logic related to frequency validation in the function.
   
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            adjusted = False
            while not adjusted:                
                if n >= 0:
                    offset = timedelta(seconds=0)
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        offset = timedelta(seconds=0)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        offset = timedelta(seconds=-1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        offset = timedelta(seconds=0)
                
                business_hours_per_day = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
                    for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )
                
                business_day_adjust, remaining_sec = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    business_day_adjust, remaining_sec = -business_day_adjust, -remaining_sec
                
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=business_day_adjust)
                remaining_offset = timedelta(minutes=remaining_sec)
                
                other += business_day_offset
                other += remaining_offset
                
                adjusted = True
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic to make the necessary validations and offsets based on the business day adjustments and remaining business hour offsets, the corrected function should resolve the `ValueError` when validating the frequency with `DatetimeIndex` using `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, as reported in the GitHub issue.
