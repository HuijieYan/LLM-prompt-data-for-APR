### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` when trying to validate a frequency in `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when dealing with periods and holidays in the `pd.date_range` function, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated due to improper validation of frequencies.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation logic correctly handles custom business hours, including holidays, in `DatetimeIndex`.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if hasattr(other, 'tz'):
                other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if bd != 0:
                if skip_bd.onOffset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r) if r else timedelta()

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break

                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic inside the `apply` function, particularly handling business days, business hours, and adjustments for different time intervals, we address the root cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This fix should resolve the `ValueError` and ensure correct behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours that include holidays.
