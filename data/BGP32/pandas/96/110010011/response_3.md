### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised during the validation of a frequency.
3. The GitHub issue reports an incorrect behavior when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, leading to more than the expected number of periods in the output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours when holidays are involved, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output.
   
### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug lies in the `apply` function's logic to handle business hours when adjusting for holidays.
2. When adjusting for holidays, the logic to calculate the correct number of business days and remaining business hours is flawed, leading to an unexpected output.
3. The error message in the failing test indicates a frequency validation issue, where the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, causing a `ValueError` to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Focus on the logic related to adjustments for holidays and ensure that the correct number of business days and remaining business hours are calculated accurately.
2. Check the calculations related to holidays and adjust the logic to handle holidays appropriately without affecting the overall duration being calculated.
3. Make necessary modifications to address the incorrect frequency validation issue and prevent the `ValueError` from being raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function fixing the buggy behavior
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the provided datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._skip_non_business_days_forward(other)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._skip_non_business_days_backward(other)
            other = self._next_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate the total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the business day adjustment and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust for business days
        if bd != 0:
            other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        other += timedelta(minutes=r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the logic as shown in the corrected version, the buggy behavior related to holidays and frequency validation should be resolved, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
