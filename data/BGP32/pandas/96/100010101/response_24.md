### Bug Location and Explanation
The bug is likely located in the `apply` function where it is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised because the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly adjusting the input datetime to align with the custom business hours, leading to a discrepancy in the inferred frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input datetime is correctly adjusted according to the specified business hours. This involves handling cases where adjustments need to be made in both positive and negative directions relative to the business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        for i in range(abs(n)):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments correctly based on the custom business hours and handling cases where adjustments are needed in both directions, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and achieve the expected output for each case.
