### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours. However, the bug seems to be related to the use of a `Timestamp` object instead of a `datetime` object within the function. This leads to errors related to type mismatch and incorrect attribute access.

1. The function receives `other` as a `datetime` object, but sometimes it mistakenly assumes it as a `Timestamp` object, causing attribute access errors.
2. The function also uses the attribute `nanosecond` without considering that the `Timestamp` object does not have this attribute. This can lead to errors.
3. The function might be incorrectly adjusting the business hours, leading to issues in handling business days and business hours properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `other` object passed to the function is always a `datetime` object.
2. Make sure to handle the case where `other` is a `datetime` object, not a `Timestamp`, to avoid attribute access errors.
3. Address the business hour adjustments carefully to handle both positive and negative `n` values correctly.

### Bug-free Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.shift_bdays(other, skip_bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.shift_bdays(other, BusinessDay(n=-1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This revised version of the function aims to address the issues mentioned above and should be able to handle the adjustments based on business hours correctly.
