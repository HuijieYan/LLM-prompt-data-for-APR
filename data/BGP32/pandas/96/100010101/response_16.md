## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on a custom business hour. The function should account for business days and remaining business hours when adjusting the timestamp. However, the error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised during validation of the frequency of a given index.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs because the validation of the frequency is not handled correctly. Specifically, when checking if the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency, the comparison is incorrect. This leads to a ValueError being raised with an inappropriate message.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_validate_frequency` method within the DatetimeArray class. This method is called from the `apply` function to validate the frequency of a given index, and due to a comparison error, a ValueError is raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `_validate_frequency` method needs to be corrected. The `ValueError` should be raised with a message that reflects the correct reason for the failure.

### Corrected Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the function logic remains the same

        try:
            on_freq = cls._generate_range(
                start=index[0], end=None, periods=len(index), freq=freq, **kwargs
            )
            if not np.array_equal(index.to_numpy(), on_freq.to_numpy()):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
                    f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}"
                )
        except ValueError as e:
            if "non-fixed" in str(e):
                raise e
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}"
            )

        return None
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the comparison logic in the `_validate_frequency` method, the function should now properly validate the frequency, preventing the ValueError from being raised with an incorrect message.
