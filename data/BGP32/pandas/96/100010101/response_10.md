### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is throwing an `ApplyTypeError` when the input `other` variable is not an instance of `datetime`. The error message indicates that the function is trying to combine business hour with a datetime value incorrectly, which leads to a `ValueError`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `apply` checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`. If it is not, it raises an `ApplyTypeError`.
2. The calculation logic inside the function aims to adjust a datetime value based on the business hours specified in `self.start` and `self.end`.
3. The bug likely occurs during the adjustment process when trying to modify the `other` datetime value in accordance with the business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We'll modify the function to directly handle the case when `other` is not an instance of `datetime` by raising an `ApplyTypeError`.
2. We'll ensure that the adjustment process accurately follows the business hours specified, handling both positive and negative business hours adjustments correctly.

### Updated Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    n = self.n
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            bhour_remain -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        while bhour_remain:
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
                bhour_remain -= bhour

    return other
```

After applying these changes, the `apply` function should now handle the adjustment logic correctly, ensuring that adjustment by business hours is done accurately.
