### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour offset. The function is trying to calculate the adjusted datetime by incrementing or decrementing the input datetime by a specific number of business hours. However, there are multiple issues within the function causing it to fail.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the test. The error message specifies that the inferred frequency from the input values does not conform to the passed frequency, which is causing the test to fail.

Upon analyzing the function and the expected input/output values provided for the test cases, it is evident that the function has issues with calculating business days and adjusting the datetime accordingly.

### Bug
The bug lies in the way the function is calculating business days and adjusting the time based on that. It seems like the business day calculation logic is not handling certain cases properly, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. **Adjust Business Day Calculation**: Ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of business days to skip and adjusts the datetime object accordingly.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle edge cases where the adjustment may lead to unexpected results.
3. **Refactor Logic**: The complex nature of the function may benefit from refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # normalize the input datetime
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # adjust for remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function should address the issues with business day calculation and proper adjustment of the datetime object based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.
