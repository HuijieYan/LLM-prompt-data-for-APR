### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `apply` is due to improper handling of frequency validation when dealing with custom business hours. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, which is caused by a violation of the validation logic related to business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation logic in the `_validate_frequency` method is properly executed. This involves adjusting the business hours and frequency calculation within the `apply` function to align with the frequency validation criteria.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            freq = self._to_minute()
        else:
            freq = self

        inferred = _get_calendar(other).inferred_freq
        cls._validate_frequency(other, freq)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n * 60)

        if n >= 0:
            # Step forward in business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_oh = cls._next_opening_time(other)
                next_ch = cls._get_closing_time(next_oh)
                bhour = (next_ch - other) if next_ch > other else timedelta(0)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = cls._next_opening_time(next_ch)
        else:
            # Step back in business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                prev_ch = cls._get_closing_time(other)
                prev_oh = cls._prev_opening_time(prev_ch)
                bhour = (other - prev_oh) if other > prev_oh else timedelta(0)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = cls._get_closing_time(prev_oh)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function adjusts the business hours and frequency calculation based on the input values provided and ensures that the frequency validation is correctly handled.
