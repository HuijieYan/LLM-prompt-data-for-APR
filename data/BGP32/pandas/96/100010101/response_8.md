## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a datetime value based on certain business hour rules specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function seems to contain a logical error in handling the adjustment of the `other` datetime value within the business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug can be attributed to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the timedelta `bhour_remain` in the while loops for both positive and negative n values. This results in the function not accurately adjusting the datetime within the specified business hours. The error message is raised because the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency within the `validate_frequency` method.

### Bug Location:
The bug appears to be located in the calculation and adjustment within the `while` loops for `bhour_remain` in the positive and negative adjustment sections of the function.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the datetime value within the business hours is correctly calculated and applied based on the conditions specified for positive and negative n values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now accurately adjust the `other` datetime value within the specified business hours based on the provided rules.
