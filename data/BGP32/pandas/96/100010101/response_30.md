### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on a CustomBusinessHour object. The function is failing due to a ValueError raised in another part of the code related to frequency validation.

The potential causes of the bug in the `apply` function:
1. The adjustment logic based on business days and remaining business hours may not be correctly handling certain scenarios, leading to incorrect results.
2. The error handling based on exceptions may not be covering all necessary cases and properly communicating errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function is correctly applied based on the CustomBusinessHour object. Additionally, we need to enhance the error handling in case of exceptions to provide more clear and relevant error messages.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond by creating a new datetime instance
        other = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # adjust other based on the CustomBusinessHour object
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
                                     for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds

        if business_days != 0:
            skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining_time = other - prev_opening
                other = prev_opening + skip_business_days + remaining_time
            else:
                other += skip_business_days

        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds)

        while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                business_hours_left = closing_time - other
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                business_hours_left = opening_time - other

            if remaining_business_hours < business_hours_left:
                other += remaining_business_hours
                remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
            else:
                remaining_business_hours -= business_hours_left
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_left)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_left - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic and considering edge cases, the function should now correctly adjust the given datetime value based on the CustomBusinessHour object without raising any errors related to frequency validation.
