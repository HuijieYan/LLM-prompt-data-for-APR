### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. The bug occurs when validating the frequency of the custom business hour applied. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the expected frequency.

### Bug Explanation
The issue arises from the validation of the frequency within the `_validate_frequency` method. When comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency, the bug causes a `ValueError` because the inferred frequency was `None`, leading to a comparison error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency is correctly determined from the datetime or timestamp objects passed and then compare it to the expected frequency. One way to achieve this is to correctly determine the frequency being applied and set it as the inferred frequency for comparison.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        freq = CustomBusinessHour(
            start=f"{other.time()}",
            holidays=self.holidays,
            weekmask=self.weekmask
        )
        inferred = freq.freqstr

        if inferred is not None and inferred == self.freq.freqstr:
            return other
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {self.freq.freqstr}"
            )
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By setting `inferred` as the frequency determined from the provided datetime object and comparing it to the expected frequency, the bug should be resolved.
