### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle business hours adjustments by adding or subtracting a certain number of business hours from a given timestamp. The bug is likely related to the adjustment calculations, which results in a failed test when validating frequencies in the `DatetimeArray`.

The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH, suggesting that the adjustment is causing an issue with frequency validation during the test.

The bug may be due to incorrect handling of adjustments for negative business hours or other adjustments that are not being handled properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the timestamp within the function are correctly aligned with business hours and do not interfere with frequency validation. 

We will focus on carefully handling the adjustments for both positive and negative business hours, making sure they result in the expected behavior without affecting the frequency validation process.

### Code Fix
Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to align with business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by adjusting the business hours calculation and alignment logic, ensuring that the adjustments are correctly handled to avoid frequency validation issues.
