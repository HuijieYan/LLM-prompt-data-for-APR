### Correction strategy:
1. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This suggests that the timestamp manipulation within the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the timestamp according to the frequency.
2. We need to ensure that the timestamp `other` is correctly adjusted based on the business hours specified by `self.start` and `self.end`.
3. The function should handle both positive and negative values of `n` correctly to adjust the timestamp accordingly.
4. Correct the calculations for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours to ensure the timestamp is adjusted accurately.
5. Ensure that the corrected function returns the adjusted timestamp as expected.

### Corrected function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute, second=0, microsecond=0) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments of the timestamp `other` based on business hours and days, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
