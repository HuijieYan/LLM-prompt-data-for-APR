### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours defined in a `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function is failing due to the `ValueError`.

#### Potential Errors:
1. The function might not be correctly adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
2. The validation for frequency compatibility might be causing the error.

#### Bug Explanation:
The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, which leads to a `ValueError`. This implies that the adjustments made by the function are not compatible with the business hour frequency specified.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime align with the business hours specified.
2. Check if the frequency validation is consistent with the adjustments made in the function.

### Code Fix:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments based on business hours and ensuring compatibility in the validation step, the new code should address the `ValueError` and pass the failing test cases presented.
