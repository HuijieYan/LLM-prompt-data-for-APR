### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a datetime object based on a given CustomBusinessHour object. The function calculates the next or previous business hours based on the input datetime and the CustomBusinessHour object's defined business hours. The bug seems to stem from incorrect calculations within the function, leading to a ValueError when trying to adjust the datetime.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to inaccuracies in the logic of adjusting the datetime object by business hours. The function is unable to accurately adjust the datetime according to the CustomBusinessHour schedule, leading to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the specified frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the datetime adjustment logic within the function aligns with the defined business hour schedule. Specifically, the adjustment should correctly iterate over the business hours to accurately move the datetime object to the next or previous business hours.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other)
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
            curr_bhour = closing_time - other if n >= 0 else opening_time - other
          
            if bhour_remain > curr_bhour or (bhour_remain == curr_bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                other += curr_bhour
                bhour_remain -= curr_bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately adjust the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour schedule, successfully passing the failing test cases.
