### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by a CustomBusinessHour object. The bug seems to arise from improper handling of the CustomBusinessHour object in relation to the date and time adjustments.

The error message indicates a ValueError when validating the frequency of the generated dates against the input frequency, which is related to the CustomBusinessHour object.

### Bug Location
The bug likely stems from how the CustomBusinessHour object is handled within the function. Specifically, the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object might not be aligning with the expected behavior of the frequency validation.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the provided CustomBusinessHour frequency during the validation check. This can result in the ValueError being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object align with the desired behavior of the CustomBusinessHour object. This involves verifying that the adjusted datetime object conforms to the expected frequency.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        new_dt = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if new_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(new_dt):
                new_dt = self._next_opening_time(new_dt)
        else:
            if new_dt.time() in self.start:
                new_dt -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(new_dt):
                new_dt = self._next_opening_time(new_dt)
                new_dt = self._get_closing_time(new_dt)

        total_bhours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_bhours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bdays = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(new_dt):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(new_dt)
                new_dt = prev_open + skip_bdays + (new_dt - prev_open)
            else:
                new_dt += skip_bdays

        bhours_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhours_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhours_interval = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_dt)) - new_dt
                if bhours_remain < bhours_interval:
                    new_dt += bhours_remain
                    bhours_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhours_remain -= bhours_interval
                    new_dt = self._next_opening_time(new_dt + bhours_interval)
        else:
            while bhours_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhours_interval = self._next_opening_time(new_dt) - new_dt
                if bhours_remain >= bhours_interval or (bhours_remain == bhours_interval and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    new_dt += bhours_remain
                    bhours_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhours_remain -= bhours_interval
                    new_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(new_dt + bhours_interval - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return new_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hours with datetime")
```

The corrected function should now handle the adjustments properly and avoid the ValueError related to the frequency validation.
