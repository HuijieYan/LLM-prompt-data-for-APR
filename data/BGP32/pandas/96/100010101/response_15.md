### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. However, the bug seems to be related to the error message `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`. This error is likely occurring in the validation step of the frequency.

### Bug Explanation
- The buggy function is trying to validate the frequency of a given DatetimeIndex with a CustomBusinessHour frequency, but it fails due to an issue with the inferred frequency not matching the passed frequency.
- The bug seems to be related to the validation of the frequency between the given `freq` and the inferred frequency of the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the mismatch in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, we need to ensure that the validation step correctly handles both cases where the inferred frequency is None and where it does not match the passed CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Corrected Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly apply the custom business hour offset to a given datetime object without causing the frequency validation error.
