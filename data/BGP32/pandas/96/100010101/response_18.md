### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour offset. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised due to issues with the validation of the frequency parameter.

From the error message, we can see that the inferred frequency is `None`, and it does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This is likely due to incorrect handling or modification of the `other` datetime object within the function.

### Bug in the code
1. The `other` datetime object is modified without preserving the frequency information, leading to a mismatch in frequencies during validation.
2. The function assumes that the frequency is always `CBH`, which is not the case when modifying the datetime object.

### Fix Strategy
1. Preserve the frequency information of the `other` datetime object when modifying it.
2. Ensure that the passed frequency and inferred frequency match during validation.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n
        
        # Preserve frequency information when modifying the other datetime object
        freq = getattr(other, 'freq', None)
        if freq is not None:
            other = other.replace(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond
            )
            
        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Validation of frequency
        if freq is not None and freq.freqstr != self.freq.freqstr:
            raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {self.freq.freqstr}")
        
        # Remaining code remains unchanged
        # ...
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By preserving the frequency information and ensuring that it matches the expected frequency during validation, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
