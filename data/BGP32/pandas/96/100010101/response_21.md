### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on a business hour offset. The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect return value of the function, causing a ValueError in another part of the code.

#### Issues Found:
1. The function is not correctly adjusting the provided datetime based on the business hour offset.
2. The return value of the function is not correct, causing downstream errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the provided datetime is correctly adjusted based on the business hour offset.
2. Return the adjusted datetime as the output of the function.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        adjusted = other
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            adjusted = skip_bd.apply(adjusted)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(bd):
                adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted)
            
            adjusted += bhour_remain
        else:
            for _ in range(-bd):
                adjusted = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted)
            
            adjusted += bhour_remain
        
        return adjusted
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version above, the function should now properly adjust the provided datetime based on the business hour offset and return the adjusted datetime as expected. This should resolve the ValueError that was occurring in the test case.
