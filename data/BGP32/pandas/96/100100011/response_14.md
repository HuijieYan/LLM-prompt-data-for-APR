### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for applying the custom business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` showcases the issue where adding holidays results in more than the expected number of periods in `pd.date_range`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that adding holidays while using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours leads to unexpected behavior. Instead of producing the specified number of periods, it generates additional periods.
4. The bug occurs because the adjustment for holidays is not correctly handled in the `apply` function code. It does not account for the impact of holidays on the business days calculation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly consider holidays while calculating business days and hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime object based on the custom business hour offset.
2. Update the calculation of business days and hours to accurately reflect the impact of holidays.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
            # Handling holidays
            adjusted_date = other
            while self.onOffset(adjusted_date) or adjusted_date in self.holidays:
                adjusted_date += timedelta(hours=1)
            other = adjusted_date

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining code remains the same

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass successfully without producing extra periods due to holidays.
