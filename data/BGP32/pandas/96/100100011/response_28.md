### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in pandas, which is used in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to create a custom business hour frequency with holidays. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, the output contains more than the specified number of periods, which is caused by the buggy behavior of the `apply` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating the number of business days (`bd`).
2. Adjusting the business hours based on the sign of `n`.
3. Incorrectly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of dates and times in the `apply` function when dealing with business days, business hours, and holidays. Due to the flawed logic, the function ends up generating incorrect frequencies when holidays are specified, hence causing the failing test case reported on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustment of dates when holidays are involved. This involves ensuring that the number of periods generated respects the specified holidays and business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            other = other + skip_bd

        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour_remain = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                other += timedelta(minutes=r * 60)
                while r >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    r -= 1
            else:
                bhour_remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                other -= timedelta(minutes=r * 60)
                while r <= 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    r += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function presented above, we ensure that the correct dates and times are generated when adjusting for business days, business hours, and holidays. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` now passes successfully.
