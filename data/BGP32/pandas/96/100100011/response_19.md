### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is verifying the behavior of generating a date range with custom business hour offsets and holidays. It expects the correct adjustment of datetime objects based on the provided parameters.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that adding holidays in combination with periods causes unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments.

### Identified Issue:
The bug in the `apply` function occurs due to improper adjustments made based on business hour offsets and holidays. This leads to miscalculation of datetime values in certain cases, as observed in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the adjustments made within the `apply` function need to be revised to correctly account for holidays and business hour offsets while ensuring the datetime values are adjusted accurately.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other in self:
            return other
        start = others = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if self.onOffset(others):
            if self._is_on_offset(others):
                _other = others
            else:
                _other = self._next_opening_time(others)
                if self.onOffset(_other):
                    return _other + self.offset

            while True:
                start = _other
                for _ in range(self.n):
                    _other += self.offset
                    if self.onOffset(_other):
                        return _other
                    if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                        if _other.weekday() == 4:
                            _other += timedelta(days=2)
                        elif _other.weekday() == 5:
                            _other += timedelta(days=1)
                if start == _other:
                    raise ValueError("Cannot determine next business start")

        else:
            while self.onOffset(others):
                others -= self.offset

            while True:
                if self.onOffset(others):
                    return others

                for _ in range(1, -self.n):
                    others -= self.offset
                    if self.onOffset(others):
                        return others
                    if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                        if others.weekday() == 4:
                            others -= timedelta(days=2)
                        elif others.weekday() == 5:
                            others -= timedelta(days=1)

                if start == others:
                    raise ValueError("Cannot determine next business start")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function implements proper adjustments based on business hour offsets and holidays to address the bug and ensure accurate datetime calculations. With this correction, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
