### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting dates based on business hours, handling both positive and negative offsets as well as holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, which triggers the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing `pd.date_range` to produce incorrect results when custom business hours and holidays are specified. It results in an incorrect number of periods being generated, as described in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to stem from the incorrect adjustment of dates within the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly adjust the dates based on business hours with consideration for holidays to ensure the correct number of periods are generated in `pd.date_range`.
2. Handle the adjustments when the specified date is a holiday.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        origin_dt = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self._is_on_offset(skip_bd.apply(other)):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd

        remaining_time_diff = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        while remaining_time_diff != timedelta(0):
            current_diff = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if n >= 0 or (n < 0 and (remaining_time_diff > current_diff or (remaining_time_diff == current_diff and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0))):
                other += remaining_time_diff
                remaining_time_diff = timedelta(0)
            else:
                remaining_time_diff -= current_diff
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected when using custom business hours and holidays should be resolved.
