## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The function is called within the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case provided.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays, resulting in more periods than expected.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days in the `apply` function, which leads to incorrect calculations.
5. We need to adjust the logic for handling business days and remaining hours in the `apply` function to fix the bug.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining hours in the `apply` function. This leads to the unexpected behavior when calculating the number of periods in `pd.date_range` with holidays.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours in the `apply` function to ensure the correct number of periods is calculated.
2. Handle the cases of business day adjustments properly to account for holidays and weekends.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle business day adjustment
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n > 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = next_open + skip_bd
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = prev_open - skip_bd

        if r != 0:
            max_skip = self._get_next_skip(other, r, n)
            other = other + max_skip

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the handling of business days and remaining hours, the corrected `apply` function should fix the bug where `pd.date_range` behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays in combination with `CustomBusinessHour`.
