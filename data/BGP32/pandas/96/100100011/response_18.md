### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is used to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The function encounters an issue when dealing with holidays, leading to incorrect adjustments and unexpected behavior observed in the failing test case.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Logic around adjusting for holidays within the business hours.
2. Handling of business days in the presence of holidays.
3. Calculations related to adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.
4. Incorrect handling of cases where the number of periods exceeds the expected count due to holidays.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect adjustment of datetime objects when holidays are involved. The function fails to properly account for holidays when calculating the adjustment, leading to deviations in the output compared to the expected result. This bug is evident in the failing test case provided where the number of periods generated exceeds the expected count due to the inclusion of a holiday.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly adjust datetime objects considering holidays. Proper handling of holidays within the business hours and adjusting the dates accordingly will ensure that the output matches the expectations provided in the failing test.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self.on_offset(other):
            # no adjustment needed, return unchanged datetime
            return other

        total_hours = self._get_total_business_hours()
        total_minutes = total_hours * 60

        direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
        adjusted_dt = other

        while n != 0:
            adjusted_dt += timedelta(minutes=direction)
            if self.on_offset(adjusted_dt) and not self.is_holiday(adjusted_dt):
                n -= direction

        return adjusted_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function ensures proper adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours while considering holidays. This updated logic should address the bug reported in the failing test case and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
