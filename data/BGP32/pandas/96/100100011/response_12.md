### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file, specifically related to CustomBusinessHour offset logic.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` uses a custom frequency with holidays and fails to produce the expected result.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods along with holidays in the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the CustomBusinessHour offset handles the adjustment with holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods.
5. A strategy to fix the bug involves adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays and maintain the correct number of periods.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of holidays when adjusting the date with business hours. This leads to a discrepancy in the number of periods generated when using `pd.date_range` with a custom frequency containing holidays.

### Correction:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset, apply_wraps, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.frequencies import CBH

        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace

        if n >= 0:
            if not self.rollback(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.rollforward(other)
        else:
            if (
                self.rollback(other, holidays=self.holidays) != other
                or self.rollback(other - self, holidays=self.holidays) != other - self
                or not self._is_on_offset(other - self)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        other = self._adjust_remaining_bhours(
            other, bhour_remain, r, nanosecond, businesshours
        )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")


def _adjust_businessday(self, other, businesshours, skip_bd):
    if pd.isna(other):
        return other

    check_offset = self - skip_bd
    previous = self.rollback(other, holidays=self.holidays)
    if previous == other:
        previous = self.apply(previous)

        return self.apply(other)
    # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
    # go to previous business day
    prev_open = self.rollback(other)
    remain = other - prev_open
    result = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    return self.rollforward(result)


def _adjust_remaining_bhours(self, other, bhour_remain, r, nanosecond, businesshours):
    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        bhour = self._next_close(other) - other

        if r >= 0:
            update = (bhour_remain < bhour)
        else:
            update = r > -r and (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond))
    
        if update:
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = other + self

    return other


CBH.apply = apply
CBH._adjust_businessday = _adjust_businessday
CBH._adjust_remaining_bhours = _adjust_remaining_bhours
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function and adding helper functions `_adjust_businessday` and `_adjust_remaining_bhours`, the CustomBusinessHour offset should now handle holidays correctly and produce the expected number of periods in `pd.date_range` with custom frequencies containing holidays.
