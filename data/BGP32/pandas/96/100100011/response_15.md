### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is used to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is testing `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the incorrect behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays with custom business hours.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments made in the `apply` function.
   
### Error Location:
1. The calculation involving adjusting business days (`bd`), remaining hours (`r`), and adjusting for business intervals in the `apply` function might be causing the bug.
   
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the calculation and adjustment logic in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments.
- The issue with `pd.date_range` producing more periods than expected when combining custom business hours and holidays is tied to the incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function.
- The error in the `apply` function affects the datetime calculations in `pd.date_range`, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug fix should focus on accurately adjusting the datetime object based on custom business hours, ensuring each adjustment aligns with the intended business logic.
- Verify the calculations for business days, remaining hours, and adjusting within business intervals to correct the erroneous behavior.
- Consider simplifying and restructuring the adjustment process to clear any ambiguities causing the incorrect datetime adjustments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = as_datetime(other)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        midnight_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0))

        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = midnight_opening + business_day_offset + (other - midnight_opening)
        else:
            other += business_day_offset

        business_hour_remainder = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while business_hour_remainder:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if business_hour_remainder >= bhour or (business_hour_remainder == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += business_hour_remainder
                break
            else:
                other += bhour
                business_hour_remainder -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the suggested corrections to the `apply` function, the issue with `pd.date_range` producing incorrect periods when combining custom business hours and holidays should be resolved.
