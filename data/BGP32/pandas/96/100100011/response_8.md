### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the pandas library. The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and providing holidays. The `date_range` function generates more periods than expected when holidays are included.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` to a basic datetime format without considering time zones.
2. Incorrect handling of business days and business hours calculations.
3. Incorrect adjustment of time intervals based on the offset.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function. This causes incorrect handling of business days and hours, resulting in an excess number of periods when holidays are specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the `other` datetime object retains its original properties, including time zone and accuracy.
2. Implement proper adjustments for business days and hours.
3. Precisely handle the movement between different business time intervals to avoid generating extra periods.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.normalize(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(other)
                
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self.normalize(other + bhour)
            
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, running the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should result in passing the test without generating unexpected additional periods.
