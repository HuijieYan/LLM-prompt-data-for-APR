## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class, which is used as the frequency in the `date_range` function in the failing test. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem when using `periods` and adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour`. The expected behavior is for the `date_range` to generate the correct number of periods considering holidays, but the buggy function is causing more periods to be generated than expected behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting `other` based on the offset conditions for positive and negative `n`.
2. Business hour calculation logic.
3. Business day adjustment logic.
4. Adjusting business hours for the remaining time.
5. Loop logic for adjusting business hours.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect logic in adjusting the `other` variable based on the offset conditions for positive and negative `n`. This adjustment logic causes extra periods in the generated dates, as seen in the failing test on GitHub.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made based on positive and negative `n` do not create extra periods.
2. Verify the logic for calculating business hours and applying the adjustments accordingly.
3. Check the correctness of the business day adjustment logic.
4. Address the way business hours are adjusted for the remaining time.
5. Confirm the correctness of the loop logic for adjusting business hours.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function as shown above, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
