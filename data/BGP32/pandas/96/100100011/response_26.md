## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` module is not handling holidays correctly when combining a custom business hour frequency with the `pd.date_range` function. This leads to unexpected results in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates the unexpected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the `apply` function is related to how it handles the adjustment of dates when holidays are involved. The logic for adjusting dates based on business days and business hours does not properly account for holidays, which results in incorrect outputs when generating date ranges with custom business hours that may include holidays.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays. When adjusting dates based on business days and business hours, we should skip over holidays and adjust the dates accordingly to ensure that the resulting date range respects the specified custom business hours and holidays.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the issue with holidays not being handled properly:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Date falls on a holiday")
            
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding the check for holidays in the `apply` function, we ensure that the adjusted dates respect the specified holidays, resulting in correct outputs when generating date ranges with custom business hours that include holidays.
