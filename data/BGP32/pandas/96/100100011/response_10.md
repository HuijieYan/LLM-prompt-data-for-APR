### Explanation of the bug

The issue arises from the implementation of the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, which is present in the `pandas` library. When using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays, it produces unexpected results by generating more periods than specified when adding holidays.

The `apply` method is responsible for adjusting the input `datetime` object based on the business hours defined by `CustomBusinessHour`. In the buggy implementation, the adjustment logic for holidays is flawed, leading to incorrect period generation in `pd.date_range`.

### Steps to fix the bug

1. Modify the logic inside the `apply` method to correctly handle adjustments for holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment process preserves the correct number of periods when holidays are included.
3. Update the business hour adjustment process to align with the behavior expected when holidays are involved.

### Corrected version of the `apply` method

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method to fix the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as outlined above in the corrected `apply` method, the issue causing incorrect generation of periods in `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours and holidays should be resolved.
