After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case along with the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue lies in the logic of adjusting the datetime values within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.

The bug seems to be related to how the code handles the adjustment of business days and business hours, especially when dealing with negative offsets (going back in time) and the presence of holidays.

The current logic is causing unexpected behavior when trying to adjust datetime values by business hours and days, leading to incorrect output in scenarios where holidays are involved. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the unexpected behavior when using periods along with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix this bug, we need to improve the logic of adjusting datetime values by considering holidays correctly and ensuring that the adjustments are made accurately based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        n = self.n

        # handle negative offset by moving back to the last business hour of the previous day
        if n < 0:
            other = other.replace(hour=self.start[-1].hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                diff = next_opening - other
            else:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other)
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                diff = other - prev_opening

            if bhour_remain < diff:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= diff
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(prev_opening)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug by correctly adjusting datetime values based on input parameters, including handling negative offsets and holidays. It should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
