## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is used to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and weekdays. The bug is causing incorrect adjustment when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results in date range calculations.

## Bug Identification:
The bug is likely related to how the function handles the adjustment of business hours based on holidays and weekdays. The incorrect adjustment logic may be causing the unexpected addition of periods beyond what is specified.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When a holiday falls within the specified periods, the function fails to adjust the datetime object correctly, leading to an incorrect date range. This issue is evident in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, where the output does not match the expected result due to incorrect holiday handling.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. By updating the adjustment logic to account for holidays, the function should be able to generate the correct results for date ranges with holidays included.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                other = self.skip_business_days(other, skip_bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By following this corrected version, the `apply` function should now properly handle adjustments based on holidays and weekdays, resolving the date range calculation issue described in the GitHub issue.
