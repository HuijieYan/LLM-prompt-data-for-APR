### Analysis:
- The provided buggy function is the `apply` method in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The buggy function is used in the context of custom business hours and handling offsets.
- The function aims to adjust datetime objects based on business days and business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates an issue with generating a date range with custom business hours and holidays.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem where adding holidays causes more than the specified number of periods to be generated.

### Issue:
The issue stems from the incomplete handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When holidays are added, the adjustment logic within the function does not correctly account for these holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting date range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and ensure that the function handles holidays properly:
1. Check if the input datetime falls on a holiday and adjust accordingly.
2. Incorporate the holiday logic in the business day adjustment part of the function.
3. Update the adjustment mechanism to correctly handle the inclusion of holidays when adjusting the datetime object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the datetime falls on a holiday
        holiday = getattr(other, 'date', None) in self.holidays

        # Adjust datetime based on the business hours and holidays
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if holiday or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if holiday:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business day and business hour adjustment
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days considering holidays
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if holiday:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours considering holidays
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                current_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_opening) - other
            else:
                current_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = current_opening - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = current_opening
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected `apply` function should properly handle the adjustment of datetime objects based on business days, business hours, and holidays, ensuring that the resulting date ranges are accurately generated without the issue of extra periods when holidays are included.
