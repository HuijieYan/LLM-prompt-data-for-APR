### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas` library's `offsets.py` module is causing an issue with custom business hours when combined with holidays. This issue is reflected in the failing test for `date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. Calculation errors for adjusting business hours and days.
3. Incorrect determination of business hour intervals.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing unexpected behavior when creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. The issue stems from the improper adjustment of business hours and days within the `apply` function. This leads to periods exceeding the expected count when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to carefully adjust the logic within the `apply` function to properly handle holidays, business hours, and days. Specifically, the code needs to ensure that the total number of periods generated by the function matches the desired count even when holidays are present.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Replace the buggy `apply` function with the corrected version
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = as_datetime(other)

        if other.time() in self.start:
            # adjustment to move to next business day
            other += timedelta(seconds=1)
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self.next_bday._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(self.n * 60, businesshours // 60)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should fix the bug and ensure that the date ranges generated using custom business hours and holidays are aligned with the expected behavior.
