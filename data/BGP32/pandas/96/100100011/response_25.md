## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting dates based on business hours and other parameters. The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours, including holidays, where the number of periods generated is more than expected. This behavior is contrary to the expected outcome.

## Bug Location
The bug likely resides in the `apply` function, specifically in how dates are adjusted when encountering holidays and calculating business days. The current implementation does not handle holidays correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test.

## Bug Cause
The bug can be attributed to the inaccurate adjustment of dates when holidays are involved. The function does not properly account for holidays, resulting in incorrect period generation.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to accommodate holidays accurately. The function should properly handle holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours.

## Fixed Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
        
        business_hours = [st.time() for st in self.start] + [en.time() for en in self.end]
        
        if other in holidays or other.time() not in business_hours:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        else:
            if n >= 0:
                while other.time() not in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_closing_time(other)
        
        total_minutes = sum((en - st).seconds // 60 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_minutes)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            other = BusinessDay(n=bd).apply(other)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n > 0:
                bhour = self._next_closing_time(other) - other
                other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                other -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes improved logic for handling dates with holidays and business hours, ensuring that the periods generation in `pd.date_range` behaves as expected.
