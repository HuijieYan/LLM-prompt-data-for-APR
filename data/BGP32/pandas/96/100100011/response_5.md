### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply()` inside the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file, responsible for applying a custom business hour offset to a datetime object.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` utilizes this buggy function with custom business hours and holidays to create a date range.
3. The GitHub issue describes an unexpected behavior where adding holidays results in generating more periods than expected when using `pd.date_range`.
4. The bug likely stems from the logic within the `apply()` function, particularly in how it handles adjustments for business days, business hours, and edge cases related to holidays.
5. To fix the bug, we need to review and refactor the logic for adjusting business days and hours, especially when holidays are involved, to ensure the correct number of periods are generated in the date range.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for adjusting business days and hours more effectively
        if self.onOffset(other):
            dt = other
        else:
            dt = self.rollforward(other)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
                if not self.onOffset(dt):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            n = abs(n)
            while n > 0:
                dt = self.rollback(dt)
                if not self.onOffset(dt):
                    n -= 1

        return dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This fixed version of the `apply()` function improves the handling of adjusting business days and hours by simplifying the logic and ensuring correct behavior with holiday offsets. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` pass successfully.
