### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file has issues with adjusting business hours and handling holidays.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, the number of periods is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours when holidays are present in the calculation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of holidays and adjust the business days and hours accordingly to maintain the correct number of periods.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other == next_opening_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening_time
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # adjust for holidays
        while other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while True:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if prev_open == other:
                    break
                other = prev_open
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bd -= 1
                if bd == 0:
                    break

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            business_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
            if n >= 0:
                if bhour_remain < business_hour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
            else:
                if business_hour < bhour_remain or (business_hour == bhour_remain and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
            bhour_remain -= business_hour
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply()` function now properly handles adjustments for holidays and ensures the correct number of periods are generated with custom business hours. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
