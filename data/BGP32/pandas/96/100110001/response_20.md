### Analysis:
1. The buggy function we need to fix is the `apply` function in the `pd.offsets` module.
2. The failing test case involves creating a date range with custom business hours, specifically with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency that starts at "15:00" and has a holiday on "2020-11-26".
3. The error message points to a failure in validating the frequency, specifically, the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency (CBH).
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of business hours and handling of custom business days.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of business hours and adjustments to the datetime object are correctly implemented.

### Bug Fix:
The main issue with the `apply` function is related to the incorrect handling of adjustments for positive and negative business days, as well as business hours. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if (bhour_remain >= bhour) or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments to the business hours and business days logic more accurate, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case. This fix ensures that the datetime object is correctly adjusted based on the specified business hours and days.
