### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling the adjustment of business hours based on the provided `CustomBusinessHour` offset. This leads to the error in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` when trying to create the expected `DatetimeIndex` with the custom frequency.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the adjustment of business hours and the calculations involving the `n` parameter (number of business hours to adjust).

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the adjustment of business hours to not correctly align with the custom business hours provided, leading to an incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of business hours is properly calculated based on the provided `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
2. Handle edge cases and scenarios where the adjustment intersects with the custom business hours.
3. Verify that the adjustment is correctly moving through the business time intervals.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = skip_bd.apply(other, roll=True)

        # compute the remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `apply` function ensures proper adjustment of business hours based on the provided `CustomBusinessHour` offset. It correctly handles the adjustment for positive and negative `n` values, as well as the transition between business time intervals. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to work as intended in the given test case.
