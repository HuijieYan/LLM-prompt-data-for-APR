### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The function is designed to operate on a custom business hour frequency and adjust the datetime values accordingly.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is checking if the resulting DatetimeIndex matches the expected values for a custom business hour frequency.
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency of CustomBusinessHour.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function is not properly handling the adjustment of the business hours for the given custom frequency, leading to the frequency validation error during the test execution.
- The bug is likely related to the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts datetime values based on the business hour frequency but fails to align with the CustomBusinessHour frequency requirements.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime values based on the given business hour frequency.
2. Ensure that the adjustments meet the requirements set by the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
3. Check for any inconsistencies in the adjustment logic that might lead to frequency validation errors.
4. Verify that the adjustments correctly handle scenarios like holidays and edge cases for business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.hour in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.hour in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self._get_seconds_of_business_day())

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Used `replace` method to reset the timezone, seconds, and microseconds of the `other` datetime object for consistency.
2. Adjusted the logic for handling business hours and applying the CustomBusinessHour frequency requirements.
3. Addressed potential issues related to the adjustment of business hours and handling of edge cases.
4. Ensured that the adjustments align with the expectations of the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
