### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` which is supposed to adjust a given datetime or Timestamp object according to the business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours starting at 3:00 PM and including a holiday on November 26, 2020.
- The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency of the generated date range, specifically related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Issue:
- The bug in the `apply` function might be related to incorrect adjustments being made to the given datetime object, leading to discrepancies in the resulting frequency calculations.
- The failing test is triggered due to the incorrect adjustment logic applied in the `apply` function, resulting in the inferred frequency not matching the expected frequency.

### Suggested Fix:
- Review the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to ensure accurate handling of business hours and offsets.
- Make sure that adjustments take into account holidays and edge cases correctly.
- Verify the calculation of business hours and adjust the datetime object accordingly.
  
### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        adjust_minutes = n * 60

        # Filtering non-excluded dates
        if n >= 0 and (other.hour >= self.end[-1].hour or other.hour < self.start[0].hour):
            holiday_flag = True
            while holiday_flag:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
                if other.weekday() not in [5, 6] and other not in self.holidays:
                    holiday_flag = False

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(adjust_minutes), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other_date = date(other.year, other.month, other.day) + skip_bd
            other = datetime(other_date.year, other_date.month, other_date.day, other.hour, other.minute)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                current_hour_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, self.start[0].minute)
                bhour = current_hour_start + timedelta(hours=1) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = current_hour_start + timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            while bhour_remain:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                current_hour_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, self.end[-1].minute)
                bhour = other - current_hour_end
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = current_hour_end - timedelta(seconds=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected adjustments in the `apply` function, the frequency and datetime adjustments should align correctly, fixing the failing test scenario.
