### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is designed to handle business hours adjustments with datetime objects.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is testing the behavior of custom business hours, specifically focusing on holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation within the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test.
4. The bug likely arises from incorrect business hours adjustments in the `apply` function causing this frequency validation failure.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle business hours, holidays, and frequency for custom business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting business hours to properly account for holidays and business days.
2. Ensure that the adjusted datetime object aligns with the expected frequency based on the custom business hours set.
3. Handle edge cases efficiently to avoid errors during the adjustment process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):    
        n = self.n
        freq = self
        
        # Adjust for holidays and business days
        while n != 0:
            other += pd.Timedelta(hours=1)
            if freq.is_on_offset(other):
                n = n - 1 if n > 0 else n + 1
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment process by incrementing the datetime object by one hour for each business hour. It properly handles the case of holidays and adjusts the datetime object based on the custom business hours frequency. This adjusted version should resolve the `ValueError` related to frequency validation and pass the failing test successfully.
