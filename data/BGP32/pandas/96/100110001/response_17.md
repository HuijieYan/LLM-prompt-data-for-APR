### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `offsets.py` file is causing an error when trying to combine a business hour with datetime in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, specifically related to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Identified Issue:
The bug is likely related to the way the `apply` function is adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments and eventual frequency mismatch.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the datetime object based on business days and business hours, leading to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in the test case. This is causing the `ValueError` to be raised due to the frequency mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function are correctly aligned with the business days and hours. Specifically, the adjustments related to business days and business hours need to be revised to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted without affecting the frequency.

### Corrected Function:
Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        temp = self.rollback(other) if n < 0 else self.rollforward(other)
        
        # Adjust for business days and business hours
        bd_offset, bhour_offset = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))
        adjust = timedelta(minutes=n*60)
        
        # Adjustment for business days
        if bd_offset != 0:
            skip_bd = bd_offset * BusinessDay()
            temp += skip_bd
            
        # Remaining adjustment for business hours
        temp += timedelta(minutes=bhour_offset*60)
        
        return temp
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function ensures proper adjustments for business days and business hours, resulting in accurate datetime manipulation without affecting the frequency.
