### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is called on a `CustomBusinessHour` offset object in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message suggests that the frequency inferred from the input values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH (`CustomBusinessHour`). This discrepancy leads to the `ValueError`.

### Bug Identification:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles datetime objects for custom business hours. The function may not correctly adjust the datetime for custom business hours, leading to a mismatch in frequencies.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when adjusting the datetime for custom business hours, causing the resulting datetime to have a frequency that does not match the expected frequency (CBH). This mismatch triggers the `ValueError` when validating the frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function produce datetimes that conform to the specified custom business hours.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(
                self._get_last_opening_time(other) -\
                timedelta(seconds=60*abs(n))
            )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the `apply` function to correctly handle custom business hours, the corrected function should now pass the failing test that was provided.
