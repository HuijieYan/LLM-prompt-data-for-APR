The bug in the `apply` function is causing an error when trying to validate the frequency in the failing test. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, causing a `ValueError`.

The root cause of the bug is in the calculation and adjustment of the business days in the `apply` function. There are issues with how business days are adjusted, resulting in an incorrect output that leads to the frequency validation error in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to properly adjust the business days and remaining business hours while considering the offset timings correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the adjustment is done accurately to avoid any discrepancies with the frequency. 

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # check and reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # calculate remaining business hours for adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other + bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections to the `apply` function, it should now handle the business day adjustments and remaining hours correctly, ensuring that the frequency validation error in the test is resolved and the corrected function passes the test successfully.
