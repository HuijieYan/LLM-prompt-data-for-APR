### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle adjustments related to business hours and `datetime` objects. The error message from the failing test indicates an issue with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency not matching the expected frequency in the generated `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bugs in the buggy function:
1. The `apply` function has a bug in handling adjustments for negative values of `n`. It incorrectly calculates the adjusted time in these cases.
2. There is a bug in the adjustment of remaining business hours for negative `n`. It does not handle the logic accurately.

### Bug Cause:
The `apply` function contains bugs in the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the given offset. These bugs lead to incorrect adjustments which result in the failing test due to frequency mismatch.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
1. Fix the logic for adjustment in negative `n` cases to correctly calculate the adjusted time.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours for negative `n` cases to ensure accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
