## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `pandas` package in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is located in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation, suggesting that the issue lies in the incompatible frequency assignment.
4. The error occurs when creating the `expected` DatetimeIndex object in the failing test due to frequency validation discrepancies.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect frequency assignment while processing the business hours, leading to an inconsistent DatetimeIndex frequency between the expected and actual results. This inconsistency triggers the ValueError during frequency validation.
  
## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to ensure correct adjustments for business hours and maintain a consistent frequency throughout the calculations.
  
## Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if hasattr(other, 'to_pydatetime'):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
        
        n = self.n
        
        if n == 0:
            return other
        
        if n < 0:
            preceding = True
            n = -n
        else:
            preceding = False
        
        if other.time() in self.start:
            if preceding:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        else:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if preceding:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        total_seconds = n * 60 * business_hours // 60
        total_business_days = total_seconds // business_hours
        
        if not total_business_days:
            return other
        
        other = other + BusinessDay(n=total_business_days)
        
        total_seconds %= business_hours
        total_seconds = total_seconds * 60
        result = self._get_offset(total_seconds)
        
        if preceding and total_seconds % 86400:
            diff_seconds = timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
            result = other + diff_seconds
        
        return result
    
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on maintaining the frequency consistency during the business hour adjustments. It includes handling of business days, time intervals, and offsets to ensure the correct calculation of the output datetime.
