## Analysis:
### Bug:
The buggy function `apply` in the `apply_wraps` decorator is not handling the business hour adjustments correctly, leading to incorrect results when combining business hours with datetime objects.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the logic of adjusting business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the incorrect calculation of business days and business hours adjustments, leading to the failing test case and error message. This results in an invalid calculation of the datetime index, causing a mismatch and raising a `ValueError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. Ensure that the adjustments are handled correctly and the business hours are calculated accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_closing_time(other)
                    remain = prev_open - other
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other) - bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, the function should now produce the correct results and pass the failing test case.
