### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` defined in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is intended to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file uses a `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a specific start time and holidays to create a date range. The test fails with a `ValueError`.
3. The error message indicates a problem with validating the frequency of the date range. The `Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH` message suggests that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.
4. The bug likely lies in the logic of adjusting the given datetime object based on the business hour offset. The incorrect adjustment might result in the frequency mismatch causing the validation failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug fix should focus on ensuring that the adjustments made to the datetime object based on the business hour offset align with the expected frequency.
2. Check the logic of adjusting the datetime object for both positive and negative offsets to ensure it correctly handles business hour boundaries.
3. Verify the calculations for business hours and days adjustments to accurately reflect the business hour offset.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Apply the offset adjustments
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Calculate business days adjustment
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Iterate to adjust business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic of adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset, the corrected version of the function should align the frequencies correctly and pass the failing test.
