### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is supposed to handle adjustments of business hours. It checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime` and then proceeds with adjusting business hours accordingly.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` relies on `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency but encounters a validation error due to incorrect adjustments.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in frequencies between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.
4. The bug in the `apply` function can be attributed to incorrect handling of business hours adjustment in scenarios where the frequency involves skipping certain business days or hours.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of business days and hours according to the specified business hour frequency.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_days = 0
            if n < 0:
                business_days = -bd  # adjust for negative business days

            other += BusinessDay(n=business_days)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments to business days and hours as outlined above, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test successfully.
