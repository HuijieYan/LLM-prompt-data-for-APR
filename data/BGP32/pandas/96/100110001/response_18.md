### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method that is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on a given business day offset.
2. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of creating a date range with custom business hours, but it fails due to an error related to frequency validation.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect adjustment of dates when applying the custom business hour offset in the `apply` function.
5. The error during frequency validation suggests that the adjusted datetime objects are not aligning properly with the specified custom business hours frequency.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime objects in the `apply` function are correct and align with the specified custom business hours.
2. Check the logic for adjusting for business days and remaining business hours to ensure consistency with the custom business hour offset.
3. Verify that the adjustments consider the start and end times of the custom business hours specified.
4. Update the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime object based on the custom business hour offset to pass the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other to align with custom business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[-1]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours in seconds for one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, remainder = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, remainder = -bd, -remainder

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remainder)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                # calculate remaining business hours in the current interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # calculate remaining business hours in the current interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic within the `apply` function to correctly align with the custom business hours, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
