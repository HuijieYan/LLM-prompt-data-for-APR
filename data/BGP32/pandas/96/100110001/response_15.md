## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation in a Datetime Array/Index or Timedelta Array/Index.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` uses a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with a specified start time and custom holidays.
3. The error occurs when attempting to validate the frequency against the values of the Datetime Index.
4. The bug likely originates in the `apply()` function under the `apply_wraps` decorator and involves the logic for adjusting business days and hours.

## Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of business days and hours adjustments within the `apply()` function. The failure to correctly adjust the datetime object according to the specified frequency leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual results, triggering a frequency validation error.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustments for business days and hours are correctly applied to align with the specified frequency, which will resolve the frequency validation error.

## Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 3600)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_hours(self._prev_opening_time(other) + bhour_remain)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                bhour = self._get_business_hours(other)
                if bhour_remain total_seconds() > bhour.total_seconds():
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function includes revised logic for adjusting business days and hours based on the specified frequency, ensuring correct alignment with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency when used in conjunction with DatetimeIndex.
