### Analysis:
- The `apply` function is designed to apply the given CustomBusinessHour offset to a datetime object.
- The error occurs when this function is called with a specific configuration in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation.
- The failing test is related to creating a DatetimeIndex with a CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Bugs and Fixes:
1. The function does not handle CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly.
2. The cause of the bug is improper handling of the CustomBusinessHour frequency in the `apply` function.
3. The validation of frequency fails due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
4. To fix the bug, the CustomBusinessHour frequency should be properly handled to match the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Other logic remains the same
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            return self.rollforward(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Add a new method to CustomBusinessHour
def rollforward(self, other):
    n = self.n
    if n >= 0:
        raise ValueError("rollforward not implemented for positive offsets")
    return self.apply(other)
```

By introducing the `rollforward` method specifically for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, we ensure that the CustomBusinessHour frequency is correctly handled. This implementation should resolve the frequency validation error, allowing the corrected function to pass the failing test.
