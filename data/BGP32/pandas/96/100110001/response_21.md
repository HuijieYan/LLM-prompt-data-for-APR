### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class which is designed to adjust a given datetime object to the next or previous business hour based on the specified rules.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, but it fails due to an error related to frequency validation.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation, specifically about the mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency, causing the test to fail.
4. The bug in the `apply` method is likely causing the frequency mismatch issue, leading to the failure in the test case.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` method align with the business hour frequency defined in the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` method align with the business hour offsets accurately.
2. Take into account the start time and holidays defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, apply_wraps, ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        orig_other = other
        n = self.n

        if n > 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                if self.on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
                if self.on_offset(other):
                    n += 1

        if self._is_on_offset(orig_other):
            return other
        else:
            return self.apply(other)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Create a CustomBusinessHour frequency for testing
freq = CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
    [
        "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
        "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
        "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
        "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
    ],
    freq=freq,
)

assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

By making the adjustments in the `apply` method correctly based on the business hour frequency defined in the test case, the corrected version of the code should now pass the failing test.
