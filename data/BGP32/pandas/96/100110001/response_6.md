### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` module is intended to handle combining business hours with datetime objects. However, the bug seems to be related to the adjustments made to the datetime object for business hours, which is causing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail with a ValueError related to frequency validation.

### Issue:
The bug is likely to be in the logic of adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, which is leading to an incorrect frequency being inferred or computed, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object are correctly handling the business hours.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the datetime object for both positive and negative `n` values.
3. Check if the adjustments are aligning with the expected business hours and not causing an incorrect frequency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Handle edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Adjust the remaining business hours and business days
        other = self._adjust_business_hours(other, n)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_business_hours(self, other, n):
    # Function to adjust remaining business hours and business days
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )
    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r
    
    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    # Adjust remaining business hours
    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        if n >= 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
    return other
```

By adjusting the business hour calculations and the adjustments to the datetime object in a more accurate manner, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
