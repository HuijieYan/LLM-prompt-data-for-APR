### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is related to custom business hours and adjusting datetime objects based on business hour offsets. The test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

The failing test case is using a custom business hour frequency, and the generated `expected` result is not matching the actual result due to an issue with adjusting the datetime objects within the `apply` function.

### Error Cause:
The buggy `apply` function fails to properly adjust datetime objects based on business hours, resulting in incorrect offsets. This causes the test case's expected result to differ from the actual result, triggering a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the datetime objects are adjusted correctly based on the custom business hour offsets. Specifically, handling adjustments for business days and remaining business hours accurately is crucial to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

            if bd > 0:
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    if n > 0:
                        other += skip_bd
                    else:
                        other -= skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections to the `apply` function, the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without triggering a `ValueError`.
