### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is designed to handle applying an offset to a given datetime object. The error message from the failing test indicates an issue with the frequency validation relating to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of business hours and handling of adjustments based on positive or negative offsets.
2. Adjustments related to business days and remaining business hours are error-prone.
3. Handling of next opening/closing times within a business day.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from incorrect adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function, leading to an incompatible result with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and validate the logic for calculating business hours and making adjustments based on positive/negative offsets.
2. Check the handling of business days and remaining business hours for correctness.
3. Ensure accurate calculations for next opening/closing times within business days.
4. Debug and test the function using the provided failing test to verify the corrections.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(n, businesshours // 60)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - bhour)
                    bhour_remain += bhour

        return as_datetime(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculations and adjustments in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case. It is important to verify the fixed function against the failing test to confirm the resolution.
