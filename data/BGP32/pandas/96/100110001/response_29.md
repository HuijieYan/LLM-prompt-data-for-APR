## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is not handling the case of applying a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency correctly when used with `pd.date_range`. This leads to a `ValueError` in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` since the inferred frequency doesn't match the passed frequency.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment logic for handling positive and negative business hours may not be correct.
2. The adjustment for business days may not cover all necessary cases.
3. Calculations related to adjusting business hours within intervals may have issues.

## Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of applying the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency within the `apply` function. The adjustments for business hours, days, and intervals are not implemented accurately, leading to a mismatch in the inferred frequency when generating the date range.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting business hours to ensure correct adjustments within intervals.
2. Update the adjustment process for handling positive and negative business hours appropriately.
3. Revise the logic for adjusting business days to cover all necessary cases.
4. Ensure that the adjustments align with the expected behavior of `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully without raising a `ValueError`.
