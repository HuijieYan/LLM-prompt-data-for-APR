## Analysis:
The `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting a given datetime value based on the business hours specified. The function is designed to handle cases where `other` is an instance of `datetime`. However, the function contains several conditional checks and adjustments based on business days and business hours, which might be causing the error.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is testing the behavior of custom business hours with specified holidays. It creates a `CustomBusinessHour` object `freq` and then creates a date range with this frequency. The expected result is compared to the actual result using `assert_index_equal`.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` variable based on business hours and days
2. Calculation and adjustment of business hours and days
3. Handling of positive and negative business day adjustments
4. Business day and business hour boundary conditions

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by incorrect adjustments of `other` based on business hours and days inside the `apply` function. This can lead to misalignment of the datetime values generated using the custom business hours, resulting in failed frequency validation in the test function.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to accurately adjust the `other` datetime based on the specified business hours and days.
2. Ensure that the business day and business hour calculations are correct for both positive and negative adjustments.
3. Handle edge cases and boundary conditions properly to avoid any misalignments.

## Correction of the Buggy Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 3600)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        business_days_to_skip = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other += business_days_to_skip
        other_time = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[i], self.end[i]) for i in range(len(self.start)))
        
        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while r != 0:
                    business_hour_left = other_time - ((other - self._prev_opening_time(other)).seconds / 3600)
                    if r < business_hour_left:
                        other += timedelta(hours=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= business_hour_left
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(hours=r)
            else:
                while r != 0:
                    business_hour_left = (self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other).seconds / 3600
                    if r < business_hour_left or (r == business_hour_left and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += timedelta(hours=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= business_hour_left
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(hours=r))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses potential errors by adjusting the `other` datetime accurately based on business hours and days. It ensures correct calculations for business days and hours, handling both positive and negative adjustments properly. Additionally, it addresses edge cases and boundary conditions to avoid misalignments in custom business hours.
