### Analysis:
The error message indicates a ValueError being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method within the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimelike` module. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency, but the error occurs when the expected `pd.DatetimeIndex` is being created.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug is likely within the implementation of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file, specifically in the `apply` method. The error message suggests that the passed frequency does not conform to the inferred frequency, leading to the creation of the expected `pd.DatetimeIndex` failing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the business hour offset adjustments in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The incorrect adjustment logic may lead to the generation of incorrect timestamps, causing the frequency mismatch observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, carefully review the adjustment logic in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. Ensure that the adjustments for business hours are correctly calculated and applied to the timestamps, considering both positive and negative offsets correctly. The adjustments should align with the expected behavior of business hours to generate the correct frequency for the `pd.DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` method:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        adjusted_time = other
        if self.on_offset(other):
            adjusted_time = BusinessHour()._next_opening_time(other)  # Reset to next opening time
        
        n = self.n
        business_hours = 8  # Assuming 8 business hours per day
        
        bd, r = divmod(n, business_hours)
        
        adjusted_time += timedelta(1) * bd  # Adjust by business days
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    adjusted_time += timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self.on_offset(adjusted_time):
                        r -= 1
            else:
                while r > 0:
                    adjusted_time -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self.on_offset(adjusted_time):
                        r -= 1
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business day offset and the remaining business hours correctly, the corrected version of the `apply` method should now handle business hour offsets accurately and produce the expected frequency for the `pd.DatetimeIndex`.
