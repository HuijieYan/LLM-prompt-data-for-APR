### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the offsets.py file is attempting to adjust timestamps based on business hours. However, the bug seems to be related to the way the adjustment is being calculated and applied. This bug is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to raise a ValueError related to frequency validation.

### Bug Identification:
The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of business hours is being calculated for negative offsets `n` in the `else` part of the `n` processing block. The calculation and adjustment logic after the `else` condition for negative offsets appears to be incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
Due to incorrect calculations and adjustments for negative offsets, the resulting timestamps are not aligning properly with the business hour intervals specified, leading to a frequency validation error in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting timestamps within the `else` block for negative offsets. Adjustments need to ensure that the timestamps align correctly with the specified business hour intervals to avoid the frequency validation error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should pass the failing test:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling negative offsets to align timestamps properly with the specified business hour intervals.
