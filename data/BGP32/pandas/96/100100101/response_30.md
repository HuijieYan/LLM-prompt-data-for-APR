### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function occurs when the input `other` is a `Timestamp` object, which is not handled correctly. The function tries to modify the `other` parameter by creating a new `datetime` object without maintaining the `Timestamp` characteristics. This results in an incorrect adjustment of the date and time values, leading to unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that when `other` is a `Timestamp` object, we correctly handle it without losing the `Timestamp` attributes. We should avoid converting it to a regular `datetime` object. Instead, we should make adjustments to the `Timestamp` object itself to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessDay, BusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, CustomBusinessHour):
        n = self.n

        # adjust the Timestamp object to the next business hour start or end
        if n >= 0:
            if other.hour >= self.end[0].hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # move to the next opening time if necessary
                other = other + pd.offsets.Hour(freq=self) - pd.offsets.Hour()
        else:
            if other.hour <= self.start[0].hour:
                # move to the previous business hour end
                other = other - pd.offsets.Hour() 

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # move to the next opening time and then to the closing time
                other = other + pd.offsets.Hour(freq=self) - pd.offsets.Hour()

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with CustomBusinessHour")
```

The corrected function ensures that adjustments to the `Timestamp` object are made while maintaining its `Timestamp` attributes. Now, the function should handle `CustomBusinessHour` objects correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
