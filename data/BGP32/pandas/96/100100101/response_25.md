The buggy function `apply` has issues with the way it adjusts and calculates the business hours. The bugs are related to how it handles the adjustment of business days and remaining hours.

Here are the identified issues:
1. In the case of negative business days (n < 0), the function incorrectly calculates the remaining business hours and the adjustment process after that.
2. The handling of the remaining business hours when adjusting is not accurate and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bugs, the adjustment and calculation logic for negative business days needs to be revised to handle the remaining hours correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour_remain
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - timedelta(seconds=1) + bhour_remain

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustment for negative business days and remaining hours is correctly calculated and applied. The adjustments and handling of business days and hours are now fixed to produce the expected results as specified in the failing test cases.
