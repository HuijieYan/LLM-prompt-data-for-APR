### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is related to the logic of adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours. The function is incorrectly adjusting the `other` datetime object, causing it to deviate from the desired behavior, leading to incorrect output.

The issue stems from how the function handles business days, business hours, and the adjustment process. The incorrect adjustments lead to an incorrect final output datetime object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours. We should ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated to meet the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By addressing the adjustment logic in the corrected function, we ensure that the `other` datetime object is adjusted correctly based on the specified business hours, leading to the desired output.
