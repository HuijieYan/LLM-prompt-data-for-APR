### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function stems from an issue in adjusting the given timestamp based on the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function fails to correctly handle the case where the number of hours to adjust `n` is negative, leading to incorrect adjustments and returning the wrong timestamp.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the timestamp when `n < 0`. We should ensure that the timestamp is adjusted correctly by moving it to the previous business day and making the necessary adjustments for negative business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # calculate business days and remaining hours adjustment
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other -= skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_opening_time(self.get_previous_offset(other))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the `apply` function should be able to adjust the given timestamp correctly based on the `CustomBusinessHour` object, fixing the bug and ensuring the function's behavior aligns with the expected input/output values.
