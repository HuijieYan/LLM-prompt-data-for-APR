### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of the `start` and `end` time conditions for adjusting business hours. This leads to incorrect adjustments when the input `other` value falls within the specified time ranges. As a result, the function produces incorrect output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly adjust `other` based on the `self.start` and `self.end` time ranges to handle business hour offsets properly.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are calculated accurately.
3. Update the logic to handle the adjustment of `other` within the specified time intervals correctly.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle the business hour offsets accurately and produce the expected output values for the provided test cases.
