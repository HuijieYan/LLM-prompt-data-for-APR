### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of adjustments for business days and business hours. When calculating the adjustments, the function does not consider all edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, the function fails to correctly adjust the datetime values when applying a custom business hour offset. This results in incorrect outputs for the generated date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the handling of adjustments for both business days and business hours. Ensuring that the adjustments consider all edge cases and properly increment or decrement time values based on the offset is crucial.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, bhour_remain = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd
            bhour_remain = -bhour_remain
        
        if bd != 0:
            other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
         else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and produce the expected results for the failing test case.
