### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given date and time based on a specified custom business hour offset. The function handles cases where the adjustment might involve moving to the next or previous business day, considering business hours, working days, and holidays.

The buggy function seems to have issues with adjusting the input date and time correctly, resulting in incorrect output that fails the test provided.

### Bugs:
1. The function doesn't handle the case where the input date and time is not exactly on the specified business start or end time. This can lead to incorrect adjustments.
2. There are inconsistencies in the adjustment logic when `n` is negative, resulting in incorrect adjustments in those cases.
3. The function may not correctly handle the adjustments for the remaining business hours within a day.

### Bug Fixes Strategy:
1. Check and correct the logic to handle cases where the input date and time is not exactly on the specified business start or end time.
2. Revise the adjustment logic for when `n` is negative to ensure proper adjustments.
3. Ensure consistent and accurate handling of remaining business hours within a day during adjustments.

### Updated and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other  # No adjustment needed

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() < self.start[0] or other.time() >= self.end[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + skip_bd
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = r * 60

        while bhour_remain > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(next_opening) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour.seconds:
                other += timedelta(seconds=bhour_remain)
                bhour_remain = 0
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour.seconds
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these fixes and modifications, the corrected version of the function should pass all the test cases provided and function correctly for adjusting date and time based on custom business hours.
