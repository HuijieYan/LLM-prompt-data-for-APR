## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours defined in a `CustomBusinessHour` object. However, there are a few issues that lead to the failing test case:

1. Incorrect calculation of the `businesshours` variable.
2. Incorrect handling of adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of `businesshours`, adjust the logic for handling business days, and correctly adjust the remaining business hours.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        n = self.n
        
        start_minute = self.start[0].hour * 60 + self.start[0].minute
        end_minute = self.end[0].hour * 60 + self.end[0].minute
        businesshours = (end_minute - start_minute) * 60
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.onOffset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
            other = other + skip_bd
          
        delta = timedelta(minutes=r) if r != 0 else None
        
        if n >= 0:
            while delta:
                next_open = self.next_bday.closing(next_open, non_business=False)
                bhour = min((next_open - other) if next_open > other else timedelta(days=0), delta)
                other = other + bhour if bhour else other
                delta = delta - bhour if bhour else delta
        else:
            while delta:
                bhour = self.next_bday.next_close(other) - other
                if bhour < delta or (bhour == delta and nanosecond != 0):
                    other = other + delta
                    delta = None
                else:
                    other = self.next_bday.closing(self.next_bday.opening(other), non_business=False)
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By implementing the above corrected version of the function, the function should now correctly handle adjustments based on business hours, days, and remaining hours. This corrected version should successfully pass the failing test provided.
