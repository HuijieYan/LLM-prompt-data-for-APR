### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `apply` stems from the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the input `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours and business day. There are multiple issues with the current implementation that lead to incorrect adjustments of the datetime object, resulting in the failing test.

1. The function does not handle the case when `other` is a `Timestamp` object, resulting in incorrect adjustments.
2. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the input datetime object and adjusts it based on the specified business hours and days. The adjustments should follow the defined business logic to produce the expected output for the given test cases.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            n = self.n

            if n > 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    previous_day = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(previous_day)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    if n > 0:
                        other += self.next_bday
                        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other -= self.next_bday
                        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                            other = self._prev_closing_time(other)

            if r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n > 0:
                    next_bhour_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    next_bhour_opening = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

                while r > 0:
                    if r >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = next_bhour_opening
                        next_bhour_opening = self._next_opening_time(next_bhour_opening)
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(next_bhour_opening)) - next_bhour_opening
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0

            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please replace the existing `apply` function with this corrected version to ensure that it passes the failing test cases and provides the expected results.
