### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is not handling the case of custom business hours correctly when adjusting the date and time. It fails to apply the custom business hours as intended, leading to incorrect results when calculating business days and business hours.

The function does not properly handle the calculation of business days and business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments when adding or subtracting the specified number of business hours/days.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hours are correctly applied when adjusting the date and time. Specifically, we need to make sure that the business days and business hours are calculated accurately to determine the adjusted date and time based on the custom business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        adjusted_time = other
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                remain = adjusted_time - prev_open
                adjusted_time = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                adjusted_time += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)) - adjusted_time
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) - adjusted_time
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour)
                else:
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour))

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately adjust the date and time based on the specified custom business hours, resolving the bug that caused incorrect results in the failing test cases.
