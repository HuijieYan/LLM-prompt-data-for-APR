### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on a custom business hour offset. However, there seem to be issues in the logic that lead to incorrect adjustments, particularly when dealing with negative offsets or special cases like holidays.

### Bug:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the adjustment of datetime objects when the offset `n` is negative or when dealing with holidays. It leads to incorrect adjustments being made, as seen in the failing test example.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly handle negative offsets by adjusting the datetime objects correctly.
2. Modify the logic for handling holidays to accurately adjust for the custom business hour offset.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            current_start_time = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_start_time) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        return as_datetime(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as shown in the corrected function, the bug in the `apply` function should be resolved, and it should pass the failing test.
