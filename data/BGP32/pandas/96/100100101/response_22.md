### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises due to incorrect handling of the datetime object `other`. The function mistakenly resets the timezone and nanosecond values without considering that `other` might be a Timestamp object. This leads to a mismatch in the returned object format causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the `other` object correctly based on its type. It should manage Timestamp objects without altering their format and convert regular datetime objects appropriately if needed. By modifying the code to correctly handle this case, we can fix the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the outlined corrections in the function, it should now pass the failing test and align correctly with the expected input/output values in all cases provided.
