### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises when adjusting the date and time based on the business hours. The issue occurs in the logic that tries to move to the next business time interval. This results in incorrect adjustments, especially for negative offsets.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to adjust the logic for moving to the next business time interval. This involves handling the cases where the remaining business hours require transitioning to the next time interval correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_open) - other
                if bhour > r or (bhour == r and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    break
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(prev_open)
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
        else:
            while r < 0:
                bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                if bhour >= -r or (bhour == -r and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    break
                else:
                    prev_close = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
                    other = self._get_closing_time(prev_close)
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for transitioning to the next business time interval in the corrected `apply` function, the issues with incorrect adjustments for negative offsets are resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and handle the expected input/output values correctly.
