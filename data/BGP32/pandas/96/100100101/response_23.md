### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is failing to correctly calculate the adjusted datetime based on the input parameters. The function tries to adjust the time by business hours, but there are errors in the logic that lead to incorrect outputs. These errors manifest in the failing test case where the adjusted datetime is not as expected.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the calculation logic for adjusting the datetime by business hours. The function is not properly handling the adjustment when the business hours flow into the next day or when negative business hours are provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle adjustments for both positive and negative business hours. It should properly calculate the remaining business hours and adjust the datetime accordingly. The logic for moving to the next business time interval also needs to be corrected to ensure accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the issues in the adjustment logic and should now correctly adjust the datetime by the specified business hours.
