### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the calculation of business days adjustment when the number of business hours is negative. The issue occurs when adjusting the business hours to move to the previous business day. The function incorrectly calculates the adjustment leading to the wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issue, we need to adjust the calculation of business days when the number of business hours is negative to accurately move to the previous business day.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open - skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other - skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (
                    bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

With this correction, the function should now address the issue identified in the failing test and accurately adjust the business days when the number of business hours is negative.
