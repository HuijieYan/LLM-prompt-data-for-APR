The bug in the `apply` function stems from the handling of adjustments for dates falling within the business hours. The function is not accurately adjusting the time intervals and business days, leading to incorrect output.

The main strategy to fix the bug is to carefully adjust the business days and remaining business hours based on the input parameters and the business hour characteristics.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        adjusted_datetime = other
        for _ in range(abs(bd)):
            adjusted_datetime = self.next_bday.apply(adjusted_datetime)
        
        residual_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)
        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while residual_hours != timedelta(0):
                hours_to_next_opening = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime
                if residual_hours < hours_to_next_opening:
                    adjusted_datetime += residual_hours
                    residual_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    residual_hours -= hours_to_next_opening
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + hours_to_next_opening)
        else:
            while residual_hours != timedelta(0):
                hours_to_next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime
                if residual_hours >= hours_to_next_opening:
                    adjusted_datetime += hours_to_next_opening
                    residual_hours -= hours_to_next_opening
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime += residual_hours
                    residual_hours = timedelta(0)

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours more accurately based on the input parameters. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
