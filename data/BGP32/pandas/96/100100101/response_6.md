## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is designed to adjust a given datetime based on specific business hour offsets. The function has multiple conditional branches handling different cases of adjusting the datetime. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and business hours, causing incorrect adjustments in some cases.

## Bug
The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect adjustments when the given datetime falls on specific times defined by the start and end business hours. This results in the function returning incorrect datetime values, failing to adjust according to the specified business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to review and revise the logic in the function that handles the adjustment of business days and business hours. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates and adjusts the datetime based on the provided business hour offsets.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust business hours within the business time interval
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

With this correction, the function should now correctly adjust the given datetime according to the specified business hour offsets and return the expected output values in the test cases provided.
