## Bug Analysis

The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. However, the bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic inside the function. The function fails the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` by not producing the expected output.

The key issues in the buggy function:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input datetime object `other`.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours for adjustment.
3. Incorrect handling of positive and negative cases for adjusting business days.
4. Incorrect logic for adjusting remaining business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following changes can be made:
1. Correct the adjustment of the `other` datetime object by properly handling positive and negative adjustments.
2. Fix the calculation of total business hours by summing the time intervals between start and end times.
3. Adjust the logic for moving to the next business day or the previous business day accurately.
4. Update the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours within a single business day.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin): 
    def apply(self, other): 
        if isinstance(other, datetime): 
            # reset timezone and nanosecond 
            other = datetime( 
                other.year, 
                other.month, 
                other.day, 
                other.hour, 
                other.minute, 
                other.second, 
                other.microsecond, 
            ) 
            n = self.n 

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                (en.hour - st.hour) * 3600 + (en.minute - st.minute) * 60
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            ) 

            # adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                businessdays = n // businesshours
                businesshours_remain = n % businesshours
        
                if businessdays != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=businessdays)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd

                bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=businesshours_remain)
        
                if n >= 0:
                    while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        if bhour_remain < bhour:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                        if bhour_remain > bhour:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other+bhour) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other 
        else: 
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues identified in the bug analysis and should now produce the expected output for the failing test case.
