### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to incorrect handling of the input parameter `other` when it is of type `Timestamp`. The function attempts to adjust the input `other` based on certain conditions, but the adjustments are not correctly applied, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` parameter are accurate and follow the logic to handle positive and negative values of `n`.
2. Verify that the calculations for adjusting business days and remaining business hours are correct.
3. Check if the conditions to move to the next business time interval are appropriate and applied accurately.
4. Validate the handling of edge conditions, such as `nanosecond`, in the adjustment process.

### Corrected Function:
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# Assuming the corrected version within the same class

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and other.nanosecond != 0:
                    bhour = timedelta(0)

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other += bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the issues causing the bug and pass all the provided failing test cases. Make sure to test the function with various scenarios to validate its correctness.
