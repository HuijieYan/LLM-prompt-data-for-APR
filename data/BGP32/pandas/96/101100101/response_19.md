### Bug Analysis
- The `apply` function has a bug where it fails to correctly adjust business hours when the given datetime is on a holiday.
- The issue arises due to incorrect handling of holidays while adjusting business hours. The code does not correctly consider holidays while incrementing or decrementing the given datetime.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the code to properly account for holidays during the adjustment of business hours.
- Update the logic to correctly handle cases where the given datetime falls on a holiday.
  
### Bug-fixed Version
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.onOffset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, the `apply` function should be able to handle holidays correctly while adjusting business hours, and it should pass the failing test case provided.
