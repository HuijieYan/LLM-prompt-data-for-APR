### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The bug occurs when handling negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust). The logic inside the `else` block does not correctly adjust the datetime object when `n < 0`. This leads to incorrect adjustments and ultimately wrong return values for those cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic inside the `else` block where `n < 0`. The adjustments made to the `other` datetime object and the calculations involving business hours should be modified to correctly handle negative values of `n`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            incident_occurred = False
            while not incident_occurred:
                try:
                    incident_occurred = not self.next_bday is_on_offset(other)
                except (ValueError, AssertionError):
                    incident_occurred = True

                if incident_occurred:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments in the logic for handling negative business hours `n` to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted according to the specified business hour intervals.
