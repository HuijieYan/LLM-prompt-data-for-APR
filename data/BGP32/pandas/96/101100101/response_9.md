### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling the adjustment of business hours when advancing or moving back in time (`n` can be positive or negative). This leads to incorrect calculations and results, causing the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The function fails to properly adjust the time when moving between business days and intervals.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the adjustments for moving between business days and intervals are correctly handled. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic for moving back in time (`n < 0`) to properly calculate the closing time and adjust the remaining business hours within each business time interval. Additionally, we should ensure that day adjustments are correctly handled when moving between consecutive business days.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust other to remove timezone and nanoseconds
            other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)

            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if n >= 0 or bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures proper adjustment of time when moving between business days and intervals, addressing the bug that caused the failing test case.
