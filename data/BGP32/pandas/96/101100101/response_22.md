## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime object `other` based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The issue arises when determining whether to move the datetime object forward or backward based on the sign of `n`. The condition checks and adjustments lead to incorrect results, causing the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object `other` based on the direction indicated by the value of `n`. We should ensure that the adjustments align with the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object and handle cases where the datetime object falls on or between the specified business hours.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin():
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0]).apply(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if start_hour > other:
                    other = start_hour
                while n > 0:
                    other = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0]).apply(other + timedelta(hours=1))
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if start_hour < other:
                        other = start_hour
                    other = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0]).apply(other - timedelta(hours=1))
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the adjustment logic to move the datetime object `other` through the business hours in the correct direction, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test cases.
