### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object `self`. However, the bug occurs when trying to adjust the provided datetime. It fails to correctly adjust the datetime based on business hours, resulting in incorrect output.

The bug causes the function to inaccurately adjust the datetime in cases when the provided datetime is not within the specified business hours. It incorrectly handles the adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` (the number of business hours to adjust).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime `other` correctly account for the specified business hours and handle the cases where the datetime falls outside the specified business hours. We should also address the calculation for both positive and negative values of `n` to ensure accurate adjustments in all scenarios.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import Day
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        opening_times = self._next_opening_time(other)
        closing_times = self._get_closing_time(opening_times)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = opening_times
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours_by_sec = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_by_sec // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = Day(n=bd).apply(pd.Timestamp(other))
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = closing_times - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = opening_times
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = opening_times - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By applying the corrected function, it should fix the bug and pass all the provided test cases.
