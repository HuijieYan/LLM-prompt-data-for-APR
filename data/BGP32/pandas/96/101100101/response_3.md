### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours defined by the class. The function handles different cases based on whether `other` is a `datetime` object or not, and then performs calculations to adjust the datetime object according to business hours.

### Identifying the bug

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object in certain conditions within the function. The logic for adjusting the time in negative `n` cases and moving to the next business time interval might be causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation

When the function encounters a negative `n` value, it should adjust the datetime object accordingly by moving to the previous business day and then to the closing time. However, the current logic seems to be incorrect or incomplete, leading to incorrect adjustments in these cases.

### Approach to Fix

To address the bug, we need to check and correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object in negative `n` cases. It seems that the adjustment to the previous business day and then to the closing time needs to be revisited and fixed.

### Updated Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._prev_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with adjusting the datetime object in negative `n` cases and should now pass the failing test as expected.
