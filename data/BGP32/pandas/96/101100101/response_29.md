### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is related to the incorrect adjustment of the given timestamp `other` based on business hours. The issue arises when trying to adjust the timestamp to the next opening time within the business hours, leading to incorrect calculations and adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the timestamp `other` are done correctly based on the business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` object. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where the timestamp falls outside the business hours or on a holiday more accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # Other methods within the class...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            if n >= 0:
                if start_time.time() not in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(start_time):
                    start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
            else:
                if start_time.time() in self.start:
                    start_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(start_time):
                    start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
                    start_time = self._get_closing_time(start_time)

            total_business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            new_time = start_time

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(new_time):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(new_time)
                    remain = new_time - prev_open
                    new_time = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    new_time = new_time + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                current_time = new_time

                if direction == 1:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_time))
                    remaining_bhours = closing_time - new_time
                else:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(new_time)
                    remaining_bhours = next_opening_time - new_time

                if abs(remaining_bhours.total_seconds()) <= abs(bhour_remain.total_seconds()):
                    new_time += remaining_bhours
                    bhour_remain -= remaining_bhours
                else:
                    new_time += timedelta(seconds=bhour_remain.total_seconds())
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return new_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the `apply` method should now correctly adjust the given timestamp `other` based on the business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` object and handle holidays appropriately. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing test cases.
