### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a timestamp based on business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from working correctly. Some of the key issues are:
1. Incorrect handling of time components when adjusting the timestamp.
2. Incorrect business day adjustment logic.
3. Incorrect calculations for adjusting business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to address the issues identified above. The corrections should involve:
1. Properly handling the timestamp adjustments to retain original attributes.
2. Correcting the business day adjustment logic.
3. Ensuring accurate calculations for adjusting business hours.

### Bug-Free Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the function `apply`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, date):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the timestamp based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while not (
                other.time() in self.end
                and self._is_on_offset(other)
            ):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while (
                other.time() in self.start
                or not self._is_on_offset(other)
            ):
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate business days adjustment
        bd = n // 24
        n %= 24

        # Adjust the timestamp by business days
        if bd != 0:
            other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n * 60)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            interval_start = other.replace(
                hour=self.start[0].hour,
                minute=self.start[0].minute,
                second=0,
                microsecond=0
            )
            time_to_next_open = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= time_to_next_open:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
                bhour_remain -= time_to_next_open
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now pass the failing test cases.
