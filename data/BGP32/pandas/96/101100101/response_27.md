### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function is related to the adjustment of business hours when calculating the next opening time and adjusting based on business days. The issue arises from incorrect handling of the business day and remaining business hours to adjust.

Based on the test case provided, the buggy function fails to correctly adjust the datetime values according to the custom business hour frequency, resulting in the output datetime values being different from the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime values considers the custom business hour frequency correctly.
2. Correctly implement the logic for adjusting based on business days and remaining business hours.
3. Address any potential issues related to comparing datetime values and making adjustments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now correctly adjust the datetime values according to the custom business hour frequency and pass the failing test case.
