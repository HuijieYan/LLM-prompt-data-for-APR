### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect assignment of a new `datetime` object to the `other` variable, resulting in the loss of nanoseconds information. The code snippet `other = datetime(...)` recreates a `datetime` object without preserving the nanosecond information, leading to inconsistency in timestamp values when performing operations later in the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `other` variable is updated to ensure that the nanoseconds information is retained. We can achieve this by replacing the `other = datetime(...)` line with `other = other.replace(...)` to keep the nanosecond value unchanged.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)

            # adjust business day based on n value
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # calculate business days and remaining hours to adjust
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and other.nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the `replace` method instead of recreating the `datetime` object, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly handle the date and time adjustments while retaining the necessary nanoseconds information.
