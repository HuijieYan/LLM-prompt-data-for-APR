### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has an issue in its logic when adjusting the given timestamp to business hours. It fails to properly handle the cases where the adjustment involves switching to the next business day when `n < 0`. This results in incorrect adjustments and wrong timestamps being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the timestamp when `n < 0` needs to be corrected. Specifically, the handling of moving to the previous business day and adjusting the timestamp accordingly should be improved. Additionally, the adjustment within each business day needs to be accurately calculated to ensure the correct final timestamp is returned.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust timestamp based on current timezone
            other_ts = other.replace(tzinfo=None)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours_sec = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other_ts += skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other_ts) - other_ts
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other_ts) - other_ts

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other_ts += bhour_remain
                    break

                bhour_remain -= bhour

                if n >= 0:
                    other_ts = self._next_opening_time(other_ts + bhour)
                else:
                    other_ts = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other_ts) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            # convert adjusted timestamp back to original timezone
            result = other + (other_ts - other)
            
            return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues and pass all the provided test cases successfully.
