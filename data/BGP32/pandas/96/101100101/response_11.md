### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is causing incorrect date adjustments when applying business hours. This results in the function returning incorrect values, failing the given test cases.

The main issues causing this bug are:
1. The logic for adjusting `other` based on business hours is not correctly handling negative business hours (when `n` is less than 0).
2. The logic for adjusting `other` within the while loops is not correctly updating the `bhour_remain` timedelta and `other` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting `other` based on positive and negative business hours.
2. Ensure that the `bhour_remain` timedelta and `other` value are updated correctly within the while loops.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function `apply`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # original code for processing datetime values

        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Logic for adjusting based on business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Logic for adjusting remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now handle business hour adjustments correctly and pass the failing test cases.
