### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. However, the bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made to the input `datetime` object, resulting in wrong calculations and returning incorrect output.

The key issue lies in the adjustment of the `other` variable and handling of business days when adjusting the time. The logic for adjusting the business hours in different scenarios is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` variable take into account the correct business hours.
2. Correctly handle the adjustment of business days to ensure proper calculations.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # adjust for positive n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            # adjust for negative n
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                
                if n >= 0:
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the fixes, the corrected function should now produce the expected outputs for the provided test cases.
