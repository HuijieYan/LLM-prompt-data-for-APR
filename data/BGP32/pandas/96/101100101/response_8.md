### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime object (`other`) based on the CustomBusinessHour offset specified. However, there are issues in handling negative offsets and adjusting the datetime object accordingly. The bug causes incorrect adjustments for negative offsets, leading to wrong return values.

The main issue lies in the section where adjustments are made for negative offsets. The logic involves checking if the time of the given datetime object is in the `self.start` time or not. If it is, then the function moves the datetime object to the previous business day by subtracting a second. However, the subsequent adjustment logic is incorrect, leading to the wrong results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, I will revise the adjustment logic for negative offsets in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. Specifically, I will adjust the steps taken when the offset `n` is negative to ensure that the datetime object `other` is correctly adjusted to the previous business day and then to the next opening time within the business hours.

### Corrected Code
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By making these adjustments in the logic for negative offsets, the corrected function should now pass all the provided test cases and return the expected results.
