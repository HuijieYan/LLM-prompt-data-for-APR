### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function lies in the handling of business days and business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments to the input datetime `other`. One of the main issues is with the adjustment of `bd` (business days) and `bhour_remain` (remaining business hours). The logic for adjusting these values is incorrect, leading to incorrect output datetime values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for handling business days (`bd`) based on whether `n` (number of hours) is positive or negative.
2. Correct the calculation of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) after adjusting for business days. Ensure it accurately represents the remaining time to be adjusted within the business working hours.
3. Update the iteration logic for adjusting the remaining hours to accurately move within business time intervals.
4. Make sure the adjustment operations properly consider the opening and closing times within the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self.is_on_offset(other) or nanosecond == 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        curr_time = other
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(curr_time) - curr_time if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(curr_time) - curr_time
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                curr_time += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                curr_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(curr_time))

        return curr_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues related to adjusting business days and business hours correctly. It now accurately calculates the remaining time to be adjusted within the business working hours and moves within the business time intervals appropriately. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
