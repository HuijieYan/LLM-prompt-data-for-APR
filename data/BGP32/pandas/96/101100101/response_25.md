### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `apply` function stems from the incorrect handling of the `other` variable when adjusting for business hours. The code tries to adjust the given timestamp by business hours, but there are issues with the calculations and the logic for moving to the next business day.

#### Issues:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable when the number of business hours is negative.
2. Mishandling of business days and moving to the next business day.
3. Incorrect comparison when adjusting for remaining business hours within a business time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of the given timestamp by the specified number of business hours. This involves correctly handling both positive and negative business hour values, moving to the next business day, and adjusting for remaining business hours within a business time interval.

### Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @classmethod
    def apply(cls, other):
        if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
            n = cls.n
            weekmask = cls.weekmask
            start = cls.start
            end = cls.end
            holidays = cls.holidays
            businessdays = np.busday_count(other, other + timedelta(days=1), weekmask=weekmask, holidays=holidays)
            
            if n >= 0:
                # Calculate the number of business days to skip
                skip_days = n // len(start)
                # Calculate the remaining business hours
                remainder_hours = n % len(start)
                
                if remainder_hours > 0:
                    # Move to the next opening time
                    other = cls._next_opening_time(other)
                elif remainder_hours < 0:
                    remainder_hours += len(start)
                    # Move to the previous closing time
                    other = cls._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(minutes=1)
                
                other += timedelta(days=skip_days)
                # Calculate the adjusted timestamp for remaining business hours
                for _ in range(remainder_hours):
                    other = cls._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Handle negative hours
                remainder_hours = -n % len(start)
                if remainder_hours > 0:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = cls._get_closing_time(other)
                
                other -= timedelta(days=(-n // len(end) + 1))
                for _ in range(remainder_hours):
                    other = cls._get_closing_time(cls._next_opening_time(other))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

With the corrections made, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the given timestamp by the specified number of business hours. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
