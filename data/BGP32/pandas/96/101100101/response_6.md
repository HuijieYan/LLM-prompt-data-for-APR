### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function `apply` arises from the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the `other` datetime object when applying a custom business hour offset. The logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours contains errors, leading to incorrect results and failing the test cases.

The issues in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of negative `n` values in the adjustment logic.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours for the entire day.
3. Incorrect adjustment of the remaining business hours.
4. Incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to correct the calculation and adjustment logic for applying the custom business hour offset. Specifically, we need to ensure proper handling of both positive and negative `n` values, correct calculation of business hours, and accurate adjustment of the `other` datetime object.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust the 'other' datetime object
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours for the day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd = n // (businesshours // 60)  # Business days adjustment
        r = n % (businesshours // 60) * 60  # Remaining business hours adjustment
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Adjust the remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the provided failing test cases and correctly apply the custom business hour offset to the `other` datetime objects.
