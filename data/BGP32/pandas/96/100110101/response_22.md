### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours specified by a custom business hour offset.
2. It operates on the input `other`, which is expected to be a `datetime` object.
3. The buggy function encounters an error due to improper adjustment of the input datetime based on the business hour offset.
4. The failing test aims to create a date range with custom business hours; however, due to the buggy function's error, the test fails with a `ValueError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function is related to incorrect adjustment of the input `datetime` object based on the specified business hour offset. The function fails to properly handle adjustments for positive and negative business hours, resulting in an incorrect output datetime. This leads to the `ValueError` in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the custom business hour offset. Ensure that the adjustments handle both positive and negative business hours correctly and align with the expected behavior specified in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._get_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._get_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other)) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle adjustments of the input datetime correctly based on the specified business hour offset, resolving the `ValueError` in the failing test case.
