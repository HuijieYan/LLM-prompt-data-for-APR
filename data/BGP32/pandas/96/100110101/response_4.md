### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is not handling the adjustment for business hours correctly, leading to incorrect results. The function fails to properly adjust the given datetime based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect logic used to adjust the business hours and business days. The function does not handle negative business days properly, which leads to incorrect adjustments in the datetime calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours based on the business day offset `n`. We also need to ensure that the function handles both positive and negative business day offsets correctly.

### Bug-fixed Function
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# imports from the question scenario
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            adjust_days = int(bd / abs(bd)) if bd != 0 else 0
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=adjust_days)
            if not self.next_bday.onOffset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining = other - adjusted_time
                other = adjusted_time + skip_bd + remaining
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                opening_time = self._get_opening_time(other)
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                bhour = closing_time - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = opening_time - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_prev_opening_time(opening_time)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function adjusts the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours properly for both positive and negative business offsets.
