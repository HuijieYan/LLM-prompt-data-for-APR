### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given `datetime` object based on a custom business hour offset. The function seems to have issues in handling the adjustments correctly, resulting in failing test cases.

1. The function performs adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours, but there are inaccuracies in the logic.
2. The implementation of adjusting business days and remaining hours needs correction.
3. The buggy function does not handle all cases properly, leading to incorrect adjustments and failing test cases.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. It's crucial to ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied based on the specified business hours and days. Additionally, we should address the mismatch issue between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Code Fix:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay, CustomBusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
        n = self.n
        bd = divmod(abs(n), 8)[0] * (1 if n > 0 else -1)
        r = divmod(abs(n), 8)[1]
        
        if n > 0:
            while bd != 0:
                other += CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                bd -= 1 if n > 0 else -1
        
        if r > 0:
            if n > 0:
                close_time = self.start
            else:
                close_time = self.end
                
            tol = r * 60
            while tol > 0:
                opening_time = self.start
                if n < 0:
                    opening_time = self.end
                diff = close_time - other.time()
                if diff.total_seconds() < tol:
                    tol -= diff.total_seconds()
                    other = other.replace(hour=opening_time.hour, minute=opening_time.minute, second=opening_time.second)
                else:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=tol)
                    tol = 0
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the `apply` function, the corrected version should now handle the specified adjustments more accurately and pass the failing test cases successfully.
