## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is intended to adjust a given `datetime` object based on a set of business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the input `datetime` object, leading to errors. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file manifests the failure of the function due to the incorrect adjustments made by the function.

## Bug Description
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of adjusting the input `datetime` object based on the specified business hours. Specifically, the function fails to correctly adjust the input `datetime` object to align with the business hours defined. This results in the function returning an incorrectly adjusted `datetime` object, leading to a failure in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the adjustments made for the input `datetime` object accurately align it with the specified business hours. This involves correctly determining the opening and closing times based on the defined business hours and adjusting the input `datetime` object accordingly.

## Corrected Function Code
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Get the nanosecond value
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Reset the timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        business_hours_total = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start_time, end_time)
            for start_time, end_time in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining hours
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_total // 60)

        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        remaining_hours_time = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        # Adjust hours within the business times
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_hours_time != timedelta(0):
                closing_time_prev = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                hours_remaining = closing_time_prev - other
                
                if remaining_hours_time < hours_remaining:
                    other += remaining_hours_time
                    remaining_hours_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_time -= hours_remaining
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(0, 1)
        else:
            while remaining_hours_time != timedelta(0):
                opening_time_next = self._next_opening_time(other)
                hours_until_opening = opening_time_next - other
                
                if remaining_hours_time > hours_until_opening or (
                    remaining_hours_time == hours_until_opening and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += remaining_hours_time
                    remaining_hours_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_time -= hours_until_opening
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(0, 1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the `apply` function should correctly adjust the input `datetime` object based on the specified business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. This will allow the function to pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` successfully.
