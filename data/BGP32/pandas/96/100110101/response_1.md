### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle adjustments to datetime objects based on business hours specified by a `CustomBusinessHour` offset. However, the function has several issues that cause it to fail, leading to the error message generated in the failing test case. 

1. The function does not properly handle the adjustment of business hours for situations where the offset `n` is negative. This leads to incorrect calculations and adjustments.
2. There are inconsistencies in the adjustments made for different scenarios, leading to incorrect results.
3. There are issues with the way the function handles holidays and the placement of the adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the following strategies can be employed:
1. Correct the adjustment logic for negative offsets to ensure accurate adjustments are made.
2. Ensure consistency in the adjustment process for different scenarios by refining the calculation and adjustment logic.
3. Revise how holidays and other time conditions are factored into the adjustments made by the function.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other + skip_bd):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                current_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                bhour = min(current_closing_time - other, bhour_remain)
            else:
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = min(next_opening_time - other, bhour_remain)

            other += bhour
            bhour_remain -= bhour

            if n < 0 and not _is_normalized(other, self.start, self.end, self.weekmask, self.holidays):
                other = self._previous_opening_time(other)
            
            nanosecond = int(round(bhour_remain.total_seconds() * 10**9))
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=nanosecond)
        
        return other
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and maintain the expected input/output values for the scenarios provided.
