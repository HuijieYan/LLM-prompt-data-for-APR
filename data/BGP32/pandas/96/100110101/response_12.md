### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is not handling the case where `other` is a `Timestamp` object correctly, leading to errors during the test execution.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the test, which is likely due to incorrect adjustments or calculations within the `apply` function.
- The expected output values and types provided for different test cases indicate the needed corrections to make the function work as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is primarily a result of incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object based on the conditions defined within the function. These adjustments lead to incorrect calculations of business hours and shifts. This results in off-by-one errors causing the failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are correct based on the business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. Pay attention to adjustments for positive and negative business hour shifts.
3. Validate the flow of adjusting business days and remaining business hours to accurately reflect the custom business hours specified.
4. Modify the calculation and adjustment logic to handle different cases correctly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # extract nanosecond from other if available
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # adjust other to reset timezone, nanosecond, not using replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function has been adjusted to properly handle the business hour shifts and calculations, ensuring that the adjustments are accurate and aligned with the specified business hours. This should fix the issue leading to failing tests.
