### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is failing to correctly adjust the timestamp based on the CustomBusinessHour provided. The function is missing some necessary logic and calculations for adjusting the timestamp according to business hours and holidays.

The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` shows an error related to frequency validation. This error suggests that the adjusted timestamp values do not conform to the expected frequency for CustomBusinessHour.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function, resulting in the returned timestamps not aligning with the expected CustomBusinessHour frequency. This discrepancy triggers a frequency validation error in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function should be improved to ensure that the returned timestamps align with the frequency of the CustomBusinessHour. Additional checks related to business hours and holidays should be incorporated to handle boundary cases effectively.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        adjusted_timestamp = other
        if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_timestamp):
            return adjusted_timestamp

        while True:
            adjusted_timestamp += timedelta(minutes=60)
            if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_timestamp):
                return adjusted_timestamp
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on adjusting the timestamp incrementally by one hour until it aligns with the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This approach is more robust and ensures the resulting timestamps conform to the expected frequency.

By implementing this corrected logic, the function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output for various test cases.
