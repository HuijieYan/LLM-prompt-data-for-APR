### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a datetime value based on business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. However, the function is failing to work correctly, leading to a failure in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

### Issues:
1. The function is not handling cases where the provided datetime value is not aligned with the start or end time of the business hour. This results in incorrect adjustments.
2. The logic for adjusting by business days and remaining business hours is not correctly handling negative values of `n`.
3. There are issues with the calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in adjusting the provided datetime value based on the business hours specified. The function fails to handle various edge cases, leading to incorrect adjustments and ultimately causing the test case to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the provided datetime value is properly aligned with the start and end time of the business hour.
2. Correctly handle cases where `n` is negative to adjust the datetime value accordingly.
3. Improve the logic for adjusting by business days and remaining business hours to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments described above, the corrected function should now properly handle the provided datetime values based on the specified business hours, satisfying the expected input/output values for the test cases.
