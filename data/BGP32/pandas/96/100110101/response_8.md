### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is failing to handle the case when combining business hours with datetime in the `frequency` object. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency with the values of the given datetime index.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function lies in the improper modification of the `other` datetime object within the function, which results in incorrect adjustments resulting in the failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `other` datetime object is correctly modified without losing original information.
2. Make sure the adjustments made to the date are appropriate and maintain consistency with the business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self._next_opening_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd) + remain
        else:
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test cases and handle combining business hours with datetime appropriately.
