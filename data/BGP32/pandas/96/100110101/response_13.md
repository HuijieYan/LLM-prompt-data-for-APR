### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset to a given datetime object. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect adjustments and unexpected behavior. The function fails to account for the CustomBusinessHour offset correctly, resulting in incorrect output, which causes the test to fail.

Here are the key identified issues in the buggy function:
1. The adjustment of the `other` datetime object does not correctly reset the timezone and nanosecond. This can lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent calculations.
2. The calculation of business days and remaining business hours is not handled accurately, leading to incorrect adjustments of the datetime object.
3. The handling of negative business day offsets is erroneous, resulting in incorrect adjustments.
4. Some conditional checks and operations are not properly structured, leading to incorrect adjustments and offsets.
5. The function does not correctly raise the `ApplyTypeError` exception in the else block for unsupported data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly reset the timezone and nanosecond of the `other` datetime object.
2. Properly calculate and adjust the business days and remaining business hours.
3. Handle negative business day offsets appropriately.
4. Correct conditional checks and adjustments for accurate offset application.
5. Ensure that the `ApplyTypeError` exception is raised for unsupported data types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)  # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0) - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + (other - prev_open)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the mentioned fixes, the corrected function should now be able to correctly adjust the given datetime object based on the CustomBusinessHour offset. This should address the bugs identified and make the function behave as expected.
