### Fixing the buggy function

#### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect adjustments in the time calculations related to custom business hours. The logic for adjusting the datetime given a number of business hours is flawed, leading to incorrect results when the number of business hours is negative.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the offset when the number of business hours is negative. The function fails to properly adjust the time in scenarios where the number of business hours is negative and additional conditions need to be checked for correct time adjustments.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for adjusting the datetime when the number of business hours is negative to handle all edge cases correctly.
2. Ensure proper handling of adjustments across multiple business hours intervals.
3. Verify that the adjustments consider specific edge conditions like holidays and the start/end times of custom business hours.

#### Fixing the Bug in the `apply` Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the above fix to the `apply` function, the adjustments for business hours will be correctly computed, ensuring that datetime calculations for CustomBusinessHour operate as expected. This correction should address the failing test case and meet the expected input/output values for the function.
