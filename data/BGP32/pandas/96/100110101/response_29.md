### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hours adjustments with datetime objects. However, the bug arises due to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and hours.

1. In the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, the expected output includes adjusted business hours but the buggy function fails to correctly adjust them. This mismatch causes the failing test.

2. The bug seems to stem from improper handling of adjustment for negative `n` values and incorrect calculation of business hours' remainder.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment of business days and remaining hours needs to be corrected. Ensuring that the conditional checks are properly handled along with accurate calculation of business hour adjustments will address the issue.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the identified bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(bd):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected logic for adjusting business days and hours, the function should now return the expected results and pass the failing test.
