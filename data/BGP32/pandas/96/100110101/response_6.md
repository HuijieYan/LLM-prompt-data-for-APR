### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object by a business hour offset. However, the bug seems to manifest in certain cases related to handling business days and business hours. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency using `CustomBusinessHour` offset, but it encounters a validation error suggesting that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the expected frequency.

### Bug Location
The bug appears to arise primarily from how the `apply` function calculates and adjusts business days and business hours. Incorrect calculations result in unexpected adjustments to the datetime object, ultimately leading to discrepancies between expected and actual frequencies.

### Bug Explanation
When analyzing the failing test case with the provided error message and expected input/output values, it becomes clear that the bug impacts the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. The incorrect handling of these components leads to invalid frequencies and, consequently, the failing of the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `apply` function, we need to revisit the logic related to adjusting business days and business hours. Correcting the calculations and adjustments should ensure that the datetime object is aligned with the specified business hour offset correctly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        for i in range(abs(n)):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment logic for handling business days and hours, ensuring that the datetime object aligns with the specified business hour offset as intended.
