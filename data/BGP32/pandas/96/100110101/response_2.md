### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle custom business hours with datetime objects. It calculates the adjusted datetime based on the input datetime and the specified business hours.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the `pd.DatetimeIndex` generation, likely due to invalid inferred frequency when using a CustomBusinessHour offset.
3. The issue may arise from the incorrect adjustment of business days or business hours in the `apply` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of business days and hours when calculating the adjusted datetime based on the input datetime and the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of business days and hours in both positive and negative cases.
2. Handle edge cases involving the given time intervals for business hours.
3. Check if the holiday handling is correctly incorporated.
4. Verify the adjustment of the offset in relation to business days and hours.
5. Confirm that the resulting adjusted datetime aligns with the custom business hours and days.

### Correction to the buggy function:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_hour, end_hour = self.start.hour, self.end.hour
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.hour >= end_hour or other.time() not in self._adjust_time_offsets(self.start, self.end):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.hour < start_hour or other.time() not in self._adjust_time_offsets(self.start, self.end):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.onOffset(other):
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_opening
                other = prev_opening + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._adjust_for_next_interval(other, bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By following the corrections outlined above, the `apply` function should now properly adjust the datetime according to the custom business hour offsets, resolving the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
