The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of `Timestamp` objects in the `other` parameter. The function tries to manipulate `Timestamp` objects as `datetime` objects, leading to errors in calculations and adjustments.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle `Timestamp` objects in the `other` parameter by using the attributes and methods provided by the `Timestamp` class. Additionally, adjustments and calculations should consider the nature of `Timestamp` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.round("T")  # Round to the nearest minute

        if n >= 0:
            if other.to_pydatetime().time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other.to_pydatetime())
            else:
                other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
        else:
            if other.to_pydatetime().time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business hour
                other = other - Timedelta("1s")
            if not other.to_pydatetime().time() in self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other.to_pydatetime())
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.onOffset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other.to_pydatetime())
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain = Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - Timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with Timestamp")

```

With these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle `Timestamp` objects correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
