### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `apply` function where it fails to handle the case correctly when adjusting the business hours based on a given time.
2. The error message indicates a failure in frequency validation due to an incorrect frequency generation.
3. The bug arises from incorrect adjustments to the input time based on business hours, leading to an output that does not conform to the expected frequency. This results in a ValueError during frequency validation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input time based on business hours are correct so that the resulting time aligns with the expected frequency.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self.end[0] - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self.start[0])
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self.end[0] - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making sure the adjustments are correctly aligned with the expected business hours, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
