### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on a CustomBusinessHour offset. The function is trying to move the input datetime to the next or previous business hour based on the offset provided. There are several issues in the function that cause it to fail for the given test case.

### Issues
1. Inconsistent handling of input datetime: The function tries to reset the input datetime to remove timezone and nanosecond, but it doesn't handle the case where the input datetime is a Timestamp object correctly.
2. Error in adjusting business days: The logic for adjusting business days by adding or subtracting a BusinessDay offset is incorrect, causing problems when moving across multiple days.
3. Inaccurate business hour adjustment: The function fails to accurately determine the remaining business hours and adjust the input datetime accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure proper handling of Timestamp objects to avoid unexpected behavior during datetime adjustment.
2. Update the logic for adjusting business days to correctly handle moving across multiple days.
3. Improve the accuracy of business hour adjustment to ensure the correct output datetime.

### Updated Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with Timestamp")
```

After applying the corrections in the updated function, it should now accurately adjust the input datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour offset, ensuring the correct output for the given test cases. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing test.
