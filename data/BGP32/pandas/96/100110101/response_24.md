### Analysis
The `apply` function is used to adjust a given datetime object according to business hours. The bug in the function is causing an error with CustomBusinessHour offsets, as evidenced by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` due to the validation of the frequency. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of BusinessDay offsets during the adjustment process.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is caused by the incorrect adjustment logic when handling negative offsets. When the function encounters a negative offset value, it incorrectly adjusts the `other` datetime object, leading to unexpected results and failing the validation of the frequency in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative offsets. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustment process is correctly handled for negative offsets to avoid the issue with CustomBusinessHour offsets.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Correction
The correction mainly focuses on the adjustment process for negative offsets and ensuring the correct handling of BusinessDay offsets. This adjusted logic should resolve the issue with CustomBusinessHour offsets and allow the function to work correctly with the failing test.

By implementing these corrections, the `apply` function should now provide the expected output for the failing test case and successfully adjust datetime objects based on business hours.
