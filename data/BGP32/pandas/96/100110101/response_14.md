### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle business hour adjustments with datetime objects. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of business days adjustments, leading to incorrect results in certain cases (for example, in test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()). 

The function logic involves adjusting the time based on the business hours offset (n) provided, handling business days skip, and adjusting the remaining business hours. A bug in this logic could lead to incorrect time calculations, causing the failing test case.

One possible cause of the bug could be an improper adjustment of business days in the cases where n is negative or equal to zero. This may result in miscalculations of the date and time, leading to the observed failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the business day adjustments need to be reviewed and revised to ensure correct handling of negative n values and accurate calculations for adjusting the time based on business days. Additionally, a careful review of the logic for handling remaining business hours is required to guarantee correct adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to preserve timezone and reset nanosecond
        other_dt = other.replace(nanosecond=0)

        # adjust the datetime based on the business hours offset
        if n >= 0:
            if other_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other_dt):
                other_dt = self._next_opening_time(other_dt)
        else:
            if other_dt.time() in self.start:
                other_dt = other_dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other_dt):
                other_dt = self._prev_opening_time(other_dt)
                other_dt = self._get_closing_time(other_dt)

        # get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other_dt = skip_bd.apply(other_dt)

        # adjust remaining business hours
        remaining_seconds = r * 60
        while remaining_seconds:
            if n >= 0:
                business_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other_dt)) - other_dt
                if remaining_seconds < business_hour.total_seconds():
                    other_dt += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    remaining_seconds -= business_hour.total_seconds()
                    other_dt = self._next_opening_time(other_dt + business_hour)
            else:
                business_hour = self._next_opening_time(other_dt) - other_dt
                if remaining_seconds > business_hour.total_seconds() or (remaining_seconds == business_hour.total_seconds() and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other_dt += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    remaining_seconds -= business_hour.total_seconds()
                    other_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other_dt + business_hour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle the business day adjustments correctly and provide accurate outputs for the failing test cases.
