### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `apply` function is causing it to fail when handling custom business hours during date range calculations. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency when generating date ranges with custom business hours.

#### Issues:
1. The function is not properly converting the `other` timestamp to a `datetime` object without a timezone or nanosecond.
2. There are inconsistencies in handling positive and negative business hour offsets.
3. The business day adjustment logic may be incorrect, leading to incorrect date calculations.
4. The calculation of remaining business hours is not accurate.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the `other` timestamp to a `datetime` object without a timezone or nanosecond to match the expected input for further calculations.
2. Revise the business day adjustment logic to handle positive and negative offsets correctly.
3. Ensure accurate calculation and adjustment for remaining business hours.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other if n >= 0 else other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the suggested fixes to the function, the corrected version should now handle custom business hours correctly and pass the failing test cases.
