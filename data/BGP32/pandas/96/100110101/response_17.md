### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function seems to be part of a module that deals with custom business hours and days in a datetime context. The failing test involves creating a date range with custom holidays and a frequency of CustomBusinessHour. The error message points to a validation issue related to how the frequency is handled.

### Identified potential error locations
1. The calculation and adjustment of business days may not be working correctly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The handling of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) may not be accurate, causing discrepancies in the output.
3. The way the offset is applied to the datetime (`other`) may be causing the error in frequency validation.

### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function likely fails due to inaccurate handling of the CustomBusinessHour offset and the adjustments made to the input datetime. This leads to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency, causing the validation to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour offset are correct.
2. Verify that the calculation of business days and remaining hours is accurately reflecting the desired behavior.
3. Address any issues related to how the frequency is derived from the input parameters and its compatibility with the calculated values.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_datetime = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)

        else:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)

        return adjusted_datetime

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment process by directly setting the minute, second, and microsecond to zero before applying the offset. By iterating over the number of hours in the offset, it correctly adjusts the datetime value according to the CustomBusinessHour offset. Note that this fix focuses on a specific part of the original function and might need adjustments depending on the full functionality needed.
