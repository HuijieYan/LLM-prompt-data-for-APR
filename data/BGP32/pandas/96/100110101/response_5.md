### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour offset. The function seems to handle different cases depending on the value of the offset `n` (number of CustomBusinessHours to adjust).

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a CustomBusinessHour frequency, and it expects the adjusted dates to be correctly calculated based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.

The error message indicates an issue with validating the frequency, potentially related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime objects within the `apply` function.

### Bug
The bug exists in the calculation and adjustment of the datetime object within the `apply` function. The error message from the failing test suggests that the frequency inferred from the given values does not conform to the CustomBusinessHour frequency, indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual frequencies due to incorrect adjustments of dates within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object in the `apply` function correctly adhere to the CustomBusinessHour offset. Specifically, the adjustments for positive and negative offset values need to be handled appropriately to align with the frequency intended by the CustomBusinessHour offset.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_date = other + n * to_offset("1H")  # Adjust by n hours

        # Handle holidays
        if self.holidays is not None:
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if adjusted_date.date() == holiday:
                    adjusted_date += to_offset("1H")  # Move to the next hour if holiday

        # Set the time to the start time of the CustomBusinessHour
        adjusted_date = datetime(
            adjusted_date.year,
            adjusted_date.month,
            adjusted_date.day,
            self.start[0].hour,
            0,
            0,
        )

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function adjusts the datetime object by the CustomBusinessHour offset directly by converting the offset to the integer number of hours. It then handles holidays by shifting to the next hour if the adjusted date falls on a holiday. Finally, it sets the time component of the adjusted date to the start time of the CustomBusinessHour.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and correctly adjust dates based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.
