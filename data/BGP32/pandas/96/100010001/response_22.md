### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised in the `_validate_frequency` method related to the frequency validation not conforming to the expected frequency. The problem arises when validating a custom frequency with a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex.

### Identified Issue:
The buggy function `apply` in the provided code snippet is trying to combine business hours with datetime objects. The issue seems to arise from a compatibility problem regarding the frequency validation of a custom business hour offset.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the inferred frequency of the passed values and the expected frequency. The error message specifically points out that the inferred frequency `None` does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour). This mismatch leads to a ValueError being raised during frequency validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address the frequency validation in a way that ensures compatibility between the inferred frequency and the custom business hour frequency passed.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# The corrected version of apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not self.on_offset(other):  # Check if the datetime is on the offset
            other = self.rollforward(other)  # Adjust to next valid business hour
        n = self.n  # Number of business hours to move

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), len(self))

        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd
            r = -r

        other += bd * BDay(n=bd)  # Move by business days first

        if n >= 0:
            while r != 0:
                next_time = self.next_close(other)
                if r < next_time - other:  # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += r
                    r = 0
                else:  # Move to next business time interval
                    r -= next_time - other
                    other = self.next_open(other + BDay())

        else:
            while r != 0:
                prev_time = self.last_close(other)
                if r < other - prev_time:  # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += r
                    r = 0
                else:  # Move to previous business time interval
                    r -= other - prev_time
                    other = self.last_open(other - BDay())

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Ensure that the functions `on_offset`, `rollforward`, `rollbackward`, `next_open`, `last_open`, `next_close`, and `last_close` are defined appropriately. These functions should handle the logic of moving to next valid business hours, rolling forward/backward, finding next/last open and close times within the business hour offset.

By implementing these changes, the corrected `apply` function should now correctly adjust datetime objects based on the provided business hour offset and pass the failing test case.
