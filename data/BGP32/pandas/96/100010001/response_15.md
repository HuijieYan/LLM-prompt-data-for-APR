### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in the context of CustomBusinessHour. The bug is likely related to how the correction function `apply` handles business hours and datetime combinations.

### Error Location:
The error might be due to incorrect handling of business hours adjustments in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to arise from improper adjustment and comparison of time intervals when dealing with business hours and datetime objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that when adjusting business hours, the logic properly accounts for positive and negative offsets.
2. Check that adjustments are correctly made based on the specific start and end times of the business hours.

### Corrected Version:

The provided corrected version addresses potential issues with the adjustment logic for business hours in the `apply` function. This corrected version aims to properly adjust the datetime objects based on the business hours provided by the CustomBusinessHour class.
