### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a ValueError being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class.
2. The error message specifically states that the inferred frequency is None, and it does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).
3. The failure occurs during validation of the frequency for a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex.
4. The bug is likely related to frequency validation failing when the inferred frequency is None.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is not returning any frequency value when applying a CustomBusinessHour frequency to a DatetimeIndex.
2. The `_validate_frequency` method expects a valid inferred frequency from the index, but it is receiving None, leading to a ValueError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function of CustomBusinessHour returns the correct frequency value when applying it to a DatetimeIndex. We need to set the correct frequency value for the output datetime after applying the business hour offset.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # existing code for calculations

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # existing code to adjust time

        # existing calculations for business hours and adjustments

        return other, self  # Return both the adjusted datetime and the CustomBusinessHour
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By returning both the adjusted datetime and the CustomBusinessHour instance, the frequency information from the CustomBusinessHour object can be used to resolve the frequency validation error during the index generation process.
