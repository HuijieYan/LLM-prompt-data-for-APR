### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation when using a custom business hour frequency `CBH` with a date range creation function. This error is triggered due to a discrepancy between the inferred frequency of the index and the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely in the function `CustomBusinessHour.apply`, where it is not correctly handling the adjustment of business hours based on the specified offset.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the adjustment logic within the `apply` function does not correctly compute the business hours in a day and adjust the datetime object accordingly. This leads to mismatched frequencies during the validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business hours and days is correctly implemented within the `apply` function. The logic should accurately shift the datetime object based on the specified business hours and handle cases where the offset goes beyond a single business day.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(self, BusinessHour):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            other = self.rollforward(other)
        else:
            other = self.rollback(other)
        
        if n != 0:
            skip_bh = BusinessHour(n=n)
            other = other + skip_bh
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected implementation includes proper adjustment of the datetime object based on the specified business hours offset. It utilizes the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods provided by the `BusinessHour` offset to handle the adjustment correctly. The bug causing the validation error should be resolved with this correction.
