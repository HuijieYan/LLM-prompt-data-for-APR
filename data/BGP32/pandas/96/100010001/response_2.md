### Correction:

The bug is related to the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The error is raised due to an inconsistency in the frequency parameter while generating the date range with `pd.date_range`. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.

Reason for the bug:
- The `apply` function handles the adjustment of business hours with datetime objects. However, when using a custom business hour frequency like `CustomBusinessHour`, it expects a specific format for the frequency which is not being handled correctly, resulting in the frequency mismatch error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `apply` function to properly accommodate the custom business hour frequency and ensure compatibility with the `pd.date_range` frequency validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)  # Reset nanosecond to avoid edge conditions

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, we ensure that the custom business hour frequency is properly handled, preventing the `ValueError` during the date range generation with `pd.date_range`.
