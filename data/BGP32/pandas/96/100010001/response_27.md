### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency within the `apply` function. Specifically, the error occurs when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour). This mismatch results in a `ValueError` being raised, causing the test to fail.

### Identified Issue
The issue lies within the comparison of frequencies in the `_validate_frequency` method, where the inferred frequency is None while the passed frequency is `CBH`. This comparison leads to the `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency before raising an error. One potential solution is to update the comparison logic to handle cases where the inferred frequency may be None.

### Buggy Function Correction
Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the original function code

        inferred = index.inferred_freq
        if index.size == 0 or (inferred is not None and inferred != freq.freqstr):
            raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}")

        # Original return statement should come here
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the comparison logic in the `_validate_frequency` method, we can ensure that the frequencies are properly checked before raising an error. This should fix the bug and allow the test to pass successfully.
