### Analysis:
The error message suggests that there is a mismatch in the inferred frequency from the passed values and the specified frequency (`CBH` in this case). The buggy function is `apply` which is expected to combine business hours with a datetime object. The issue seems to be related to the validation of frequency in the context of custom business hours.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the `apply` function where the validation of frequency is not matching the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of frequency validation in the `apply` function. The frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the custom business hour frequency that was specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the validation of the frequency in the `apply` function aligns with the expected behavior when dealing with custom business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        return self._validate_freq(other)
    
def _validate_freq(self, other):
    inferred = other.inferred_freq
    freqstr = self.freq.freqstr
    
    if inferred is None:
        # No inferred frequency, just return
        return
    
    if inferred != freqstr:
        raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freqstr}")

``` 

In the corrected version, we have separated out the frequency validation logic into a helper function `_validate_freq`. This function compares the inferred frequency with the passed frequency and raises a `ValueError` if they do not match. This approach ensures that the frequency validation is correctly handled within the `apply` function.
