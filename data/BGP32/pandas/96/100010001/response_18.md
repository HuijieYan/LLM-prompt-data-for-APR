### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in the `validate_frequency` method. This suggests that the buggy `apply` function is not handling the adjustment of business days correctly, leading to the frequency validation error.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the logic related to adjusting business days in the `apply` function. The incorrect adjustment of business days results in a frequency mismatch when validating the frequency later on.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function wrongly handles the adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to an incorrect resulting datetime. This incorrect resulting datetime causes the frequency validation to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function aligns with the expected behavior. By correctly adjusting business days and hours, the resulting datetime should match the expected frequency, resolving the validation error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self.roll(bd)
            if not self.on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function, the resulting datetime should align correctly with the expected frequency, resolving the validation error.
