## Analysis
The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during a frequency validation process related to dates but specifically mentioning the mismatch between inferred frequency and passed frequency `CBH`. The buggy function `apply` under `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` seems to be responsible for this issue.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The function `apply` is comparing frequencies in the context of business hours, which might be leading to the mismatch.
2. The adjustment of the `other` variable based on business day might not be correct in handling the business hours properly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug likely arises due to discrepancies in handling business hours and day adjustments in the provided `apply` function. This mismatch results in the inference of the frequency as None while attempting to validate the frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments and comparisons made within the `apply` function align with the expected business hours behavior. Correct handling of business day adjustments and related time intervals is crucial for the validation of frequency.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # Adjust the business hour intervals according to the business hour offsets
        if self.on_offset(other):
            if self.n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if self.n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments are made according to business hour offsets. This should align the behavior of the function with the expected business hour intervals and frequencies, resolving the `ValueError` during frequency validation.
