### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation related to a custom business hour.
2. The error message occurs in the `_validate_frequency` method.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency for a custom business hour offset.
4. The bug might be due to improper handling of custom business hours in the `apply` function.
5. The `apply` function should correctly handle custom business hours to ensure that the frequency is compatible with the values.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `apply` function adjusts the datetime values correctly with respect to custom business hour offsets.
2. Make sure that the defined business hours are correctly aligned and accounted for during adjustments.
3. Check for any discrepancies in the frequency validation process for custom business hour offsets.
4. Update the `apply` function to handle the custom business hour frequencies properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other.date(), date) and not other:
            other = other.round("T")
        
        # Perform the necessary adjustments based on custom business hours
        adjusted = self.apply(other)

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected function, we ensure to round the date to minutes to avoid any discrepancies during calculations related to the custom business hour offset. We then delegate the adjustments to the `apply` function to handle the custom business hours properly.
