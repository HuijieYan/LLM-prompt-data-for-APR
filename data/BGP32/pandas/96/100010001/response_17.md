### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised when validating the frequency of a `CustomBusinessHour` object with a given `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The error occurs due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
3. The error is specifically triggered when the inferred frequency is `None` and does not conform to the passed frequency, resulting in the `ValueError`.
4. The root cause of the bug lies in the `CustomBusinessHour` class constructor or the interaction between the `CustomBusinessHour` class and the `DatetimeIndex`.
5. The error suggests a discrepancy in handling the frequency validation and generation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the inferred frequency is correctly determined from the provided data.
2. Check for any issues in how the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is set and identified.
3. Validate the frequency matching process between the inferred and passed frequencies.
4. Adjust the frequency validation method to handle cases where the inferred frequency is `None`.
5. Correct any misalignment in how the frequency is set or handled within the affected functions.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a datetime object
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n
        # Adjust other based on the offset
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_business_hours = self._get_total_business_hours()

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), total_business_hours)
        # Adjust based on business days
        other += timedelta(days=n//self._business_days)
        other += timedelta(minutes=r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment process based on the offset and fixes the logic for adjusting business days and business hours. It aligns the adjustments properly and should resolve the frequency validation issue.
