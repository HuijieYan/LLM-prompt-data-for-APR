### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a problem with validating the frequency when generating a date range with a custom business hour frequency. The error specifically states that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This suggests that the validation of the frequency is failing due to the inferred frequency not being correctly determined or matching the specified frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `apply` function not returning the appropriate datetime values with the applied business hour offset. This leads to the inferred frequency being `None`, which causes the validation error when trying to generate the date range with the custom business hour frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function correctly applies the business hour offset to the input datetime and returns the adjusted datetime value with the appropriate frequency. This fix involves ensuring that the applied business hour offset results in a datetime value that can be accurately used to infer the frequency.

### Corrected Function:
Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        bd, r = divmod(n, len(self))

        adjusted = other
        adjusted = adjusted + self * bd
        adjusted = adjusted.replace(hour=self._start.hour, minute=self._start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        adjusted = adjusted + timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculation and adjustment of the datetime values within the `apply` function, the inferred frequency should now be correctly determined, and the error in validating the frequency should be resolved.
