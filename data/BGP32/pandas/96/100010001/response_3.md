### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency when creating a `DatetimeIndex`.
- The function `_validate_frequency` is failing due to this mismatch, specifically the line where a `ValueError` is raised because the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.
- The bug is most likely in the logic of the `apply` function that is manipulating datetime objects and not maintaining the correct frequency information.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy `apply` function manipulates datetime objects without taking into consideration the frequency information associated with a business hour offset.
- As a result, when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency, the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency, leading to a validation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the `apply` function preserves the frequency information associated with the custom business hour offset when manipulating datetime objects.
- The logic should correctly handle adjustments within business hours while maintaining the frequency information for the resulting datetime objects.

### Corrected Function: 

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust datetime for potential mismatch in frequencies
        other_original = other
        other = as_datetime(other)
        freq_adjusted = (other - other_original)

        # ...
        # Existing logic

        # Correct the returned result to ensure the frequency information is preserved
        result = as_datetime(other) + freq_adjusted
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the fixed version, we make sure to adjust the resulting datetime object by the difference caused by type conversion to handle any frequency mismatches. This adjustment preserves the correct frequency information and should resolve the error in the test case.
