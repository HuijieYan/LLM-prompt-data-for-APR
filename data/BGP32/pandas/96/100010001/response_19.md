## Analysis:
The error message indicates a ValueError is being raised within the `_validate_frequency` method when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency. The function in question, `apply`, is supposed to handle business hour offsets, but the error is occurring in a different method `_validate_frequency`. This suggests that the issue might be related to the compatibility of the frequency with the values of the datetime index.

## Bug:
The bug arises due to an inconsistency between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the frequency passed to the function. The error is triggered when comparing these frequencies, leading to a ValueError being raised.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug is related to how the frequencies are compared and validated within the `_validate_frequency` method. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency, as expected by the validation process. This may involve adjusting how the frequencies are handled during comparison or ensuring that they align correctly.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:

                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0

                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(

                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hours with datetime")
```

By correcting the comparisons related to the business hour offsets, specifically ensuring the comparisons are done accurately, the error should be resolved and the function should work correctly within the given context.
