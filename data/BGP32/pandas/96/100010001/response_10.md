### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust datetime objects based on business hour offsets. The error occurs when validating the frequency of the adjusted datetime objects.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `apply` function where it manipulates the datetime objects but fails to consider the frequency validation properly. This results in the error message indicating a mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjusted datetime objects adhere to the passed frequency. One way to achieve this is by explicitly setting the frequency of the adjusted datetime objects to align with the desired frequency.

```

In the corrected version, after adjusting the datetime objects based on business hours, we explicitly set the frequency of the adjusted datetime objects using `pd.Timestamp(other, freq=self.freq)` to ensure compatibility with the desired frequency. This modification aligns the adjusted datetime objects with the correct frequency and should fix the bug.
