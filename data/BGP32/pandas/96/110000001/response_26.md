## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and return the adjusted datetime object. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that might be causing issues. These include:
1. The logic for handling negative values of `n`.
2. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours.
3. Unclear handling of time intervals and open/closing times.

## Bug:
The main cause of the bug in the `apply` function is related to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours when handling negative values of `n`.

## Fix:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime object considering both positive and negative values of `n`. Additionally, we need to ensure proper calculation of business hours and handling of time intervals to accurately adjust the datetime object based on the business hours.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        total_business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        businessdays, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n) * 60, total_business_hours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            businessdays, remaining_minutes = -businessdays, -remaining_minutes
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if businessdays != 0:
            skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=businessdays)
            other = other + skip_business_days
    
        remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
    
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_timedelta < bhour:
                    other += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_timedelta -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_timedelta > bhour or (remaining_timedelta == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_timedelta -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have revised the adjustment logic for both positive and negative values of `n` and improved the calculation and handling of business hours to accurately adjust the datetime object based on business hours.
