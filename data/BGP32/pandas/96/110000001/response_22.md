## Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function has multiple conditional statements to handle cases where the specified datetime falls within or outside the business hours.
- The function calculates the business hours in a day and adjusts the datetime object accordingly.

## Identified potential errors:
1. Potential logic error when calculating business hours in a day.
2. Incorrect handling of cases where `n` (number of minutes to adjust) is negative.
3. Incorrect adjustment of business days (`bd`) before adjusting remaining time.
4. Incorrect increment or decrement of the datetime object based on remaining time.

## Bug Cause:
The bug may occur due to incorrect handling of the remaining business hours when adjusting the datetime object. This could lead to miscalculations in the final adjusted datetime.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure correct calculation of business hours in a day.
2. Properly handle cases where `n` (number of minutes to adjust) is negative.
3. Adjust business days before adjusting the remaining time.
4. Increment or decrement the datetime object correctly based on the remaining time.
