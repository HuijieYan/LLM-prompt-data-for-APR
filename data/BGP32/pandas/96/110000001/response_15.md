## Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method defined within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and days specified in the class attributes.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object `other` based on the business hours and days.
- The logic for adjusting the datetime object to the next opening or closing time in the business schedule seems faulty.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments applied to the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function.
- The logic for moving to the next opening or closing time within a business day is flawed and leads to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days. Specifically, we need to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted to the next opening or closing time within the business schedule.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed unnecessary adjustments and refined the logic for moving to the next business day.
- Simplified the adjustments based on business days.
- Focused on correcting the main logic issues identified in the buggy function.

Please incorporate these changes to fix the bug in the `apply` function.
