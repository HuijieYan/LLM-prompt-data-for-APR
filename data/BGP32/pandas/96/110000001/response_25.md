## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. It calculates the adjusted datetime based on the specified business hours, start times, and end times.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the provided function is related to the adjustment of business hours. The function fails to accurately adjust the datetime based on the business hours, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the bug occurs when calculating the remaining business hours to adjust after adjusting by business days.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in handling the remaining business hours to adjust (`bhour_remain`). The function does not correctly handle the scenario where the remaining business hours are less than the business hours in the current time interval.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours within the given time interval. We should ensure that the function accurately adjusts the datetime based on the remaining business hours and moves to the next business time interval if necessary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin


class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0 and bhour_remain == timedelta(0):
                        # if adjusted all hours and the last interval is a closed interval
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

I have modified the logic within the `while` loop to correctly adjust the remaining business hours within the current business time interval. This modification ensures that the function adjusts the datetime accurately based on the business hours specified.
