## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime object according to business hours specified by the mixin. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause the bug.

## Identifying Potential Errors:
1. The handling of adjusting `other` to reduce the number of cases may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Calculation of business hours and adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining hours could introduce errors.
3. The loops used to adjust the remaining business hours may not work as expected.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function may arise due to incorrect adjustments and calculations related to business hours and days. The logic for adjusting the datetime object may not cover all edge cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and business days. We should ensure that all edge cases are handled correctly and the calculations are accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of the datetime object is simplified by directly applying the `_next_opening_time` or `_prev_opening_time` functions based on the value of `n`. This approach avoids unnecessary nested loops and calculations, leading to a more straightforward and accurate adjustment of the datetime object.
