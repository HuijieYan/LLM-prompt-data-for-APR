The bug in the given function is that the `apply()` method is missing the necessary arguments `self` and `other` which are required by the function to operate correctly. The function is defined as a method within a class, which means it should have `self` as the first parameter to refer to the instance of the class on which the method is being called. The second parameter `other` is the input value that the method is supposed to operate on.

To fix this bug, you need to add `self` and `other` as arguments in the `apply()` function definition. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fix the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

Now the function should work correctly within the context of the class it belongs to. Make sure to consider any other potential issues or adjustments that might be needed based on the larger context of the class and its functionality.
