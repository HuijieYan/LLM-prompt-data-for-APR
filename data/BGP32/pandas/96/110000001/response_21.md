The buggy function provided is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for applying business hour offsets to a given datetime object. The bug in the function causes incorrect adjustments to the input datetime based on the business hour offset provided. 

The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of negative business hour offsets
2. Mismanagement of business day adjustments
3. Improper adjustment of remaining business hours

To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure proper handling of negative offsets, accurate adjustment of business days, and correct calculation of remaining business hours. 

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust business days
        business_day_offset, remain = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))
        if n < 0:
            business_day_offset = -business_day_offset
        
        other_dt = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            while business_day_offset > 0:
                other_dt = self._next_opening_time(other_dt)
                business_day_offset -= 1
            business_hour_offset = timedelta(minutes=remain)
        else:
            while business_day_offset < 0:
                other_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other_dt))
                business_day_offset += 1
            business_hour_offset = timedelta(minutes=-remain)
        
        # adjust remaining business hours
        while business_hour_offset.total_seconds() != 0:
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other_dt)
            if n >= 0:
                delta = min(business_hour_offset, self._get_closing_time(opening_time) - other_dt)
            else:
                delta = -min(-business_hour_offset, other_dt - opening_time)
            
            other_dt += delta
            business_hour_offset -= delta

        return other_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function simplifies the adjustment of business days, correctly handles negative business hour offsets, and accurately adjusts the remaining business hours based on the specified offset.
