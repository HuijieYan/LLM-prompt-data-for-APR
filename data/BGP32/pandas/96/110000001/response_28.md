## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours specified by the class. The function checks if the input `other` is a datetime object and then adjusts it using the business hour offset logic.

## Potential Errors:
1. The adjustment logic within the `if n >= 0:` block seems incorrect and may not handle edge cases properly.
2. The adjustment logic within the `if n < 0:` block also seems flawed and may lead to incorrect results.
3. The while loops that handle the remaining business hours adjustment might not properly handle all cases.
4. Incorrect handling of nanoseconds when adjusting the timings.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic while adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. The handling of positive and negative business hour offsets might not cover all scenarios or may result in incorrect adjustments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust the datetime object based on the specified positive business hour offset.
2. Correctly handle adjustments for negative business hour offsets ensuring correctness.
3. Improve the while loop logic to adjust the remaining business hours accurately.
4. Ensure proper handling of nanoseconds during the adjustment process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with incorrect adjustments in both positive and negative business hour offsets and provides better handling of the remaining business hours adjustment within the while loops.
