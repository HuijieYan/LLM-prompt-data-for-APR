1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which extends `BusinessMixin`.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - Incorrect handling of positive and negative values of `n` (number of business hours).
   - Inconsistencies in adjusting the business days and remaining business hours.
   - Possible incorrect comparison and calculation of business hours.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug in the `apply` function is primarily related to the incorrect handling of positive and negative values of `n` and inconsistencies in adjusting business days and remaining business hours. This results in incorrect adjustments and calculations, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handle positive and negative values of `n` to adjust the business days and remaining business hours appropriately.
   - Ensure consistent logic for adjusting time intervals based on business hours.
   - Verify comparisons and calculations related to business hours to avoid unexpected results.

5. Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling positive and negative values of `n`, ensures consistency in adjusting time intervals, and corrects the calculations related to business hours.
