### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours. The function calculates the number of business days and remaining business hours, then adjusts the input datetime accordingly.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` seems to be incorrect. It should be `if not self._is_on_offset(other):`.
2. The handling of negative business days `n < 0` may need adjustments.
3. The calculation of the remaining business hours may lead to inaccuracies.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the datetime adjustments based on business hours and days, specifically around the conditions for moving to the next business time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` to `if not self._is_on_offset(other):`.
2. Reassess the calculation and adjustment logic for negative business days.
3. Refine the calculation of remaining business hours to ensure accuracy.

### Corrected Version:
```python

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(

            other.month,

            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:

                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version addresses the identified issues, providing a more stable and accurate adjustment of the input datetime based on business hours.
