## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to a given datetime object. The function calculates the adjusted datetime based on the business day hours and the number of business hours offset provided.

## Error Locations:
1. The function attempts to transform the `datetime` object to remove the timezone and nanosecond information, but the transformation is incorrect.
2. There are logical errors in adjusting the datetime based on business day and business hour offsets.
3. Comparisons and adjustments within the while loops are not properly handling the remaining business hours.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is primarily caused due to incorrect handling of datetime adjustments based on business day and business hour offsets. Additionally, the transformation of the datetime object to remove timezone and nanosecond is not done accurately, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the transformation of the datetime object to remove timezone and nanosecond is correctly implemented.
2. Review and modify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business day and business hour offsets.
3. Correctly handle comparisons and adjustments within the while loops to accurately adjust the remaining business hours.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            n = self.n
            total_minutes = n * 60
            
            # Adjust for timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
    
            # Adjust for business day offset
            if total_minutes >= 0:
                while total_minutes >= businesshours:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    total_minutes -= businesshours
    
            else:
                while total_minutes <= -businesshours:
                    other = other - BusinessDay(1)
                    total_minutes += businesshours
    
            # Adjust for remaining business hour offset
            offset = timedelta(minutes=total_minutes)
            return self._apply_hour_offset(other, offset)
    
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _apply_hour_offset(self, dt, offset):
        while offset.total_seconds() != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(dt)
                bhour = next_opening - dt
            else:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(dt)
                bhour = dt - closing_time
            
            if abs(offset) >= bhour:
                dt = next_opening if self.n >= 0 else closing_time
                offset = offset - (bhour if self.n >= 0 else -bhour)
            else:
                dt = dt + offset if self.n >= 0 else dt - offset
                offset = timedelta(0)
        
        return dt
```

In the corrected version:
1. The transformation of the datetime object now accurately resets the timezone and microseconds.
2. The adjustment for business day offsets has been simplified and corrected.
3. The logic within the while loops to adjust the remaining business hour offsets has been revised to handle the adjustments correctly.

With these corrections, the function should now accurately apply business hour offsets to datetime objects without the previous bugs.
