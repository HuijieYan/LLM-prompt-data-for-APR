The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is attempting to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour-related criteria. The function checks if the input `other` is an instance of datetime and then performs a series of adjustments based on business hours.

The potential bug in the function arises from the logic for adjusting the provided datetime based on business hours. One specific issue could be related to handling negative values of `n` (the number of business hours to adjust by). The logic for adjusting the datetime in such cases may not be correct, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, you may need to revisit the logic for adjusting the datetime in the case of negative values of `n`. It's important to ensure that the adjustments are accurate and that the datetime is correctly aligned with the business hours.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        # Adjust the datetime based on business hours
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other + skip_bd):
                other = self._get_next_bday(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        current_time = other.time()

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(next_opening) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(prev_opening)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to properly handle both positive and negative values of `n`, as well as correctly adjust the datetime based on business hours.
