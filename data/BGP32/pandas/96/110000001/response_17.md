## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours. The function is designed to handle cases where the given datetime falls within or outside of the defined business hours.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours may have errors.
2. The logic for handling cases when `n` (the provided offset) is negative could be causing issues.
3. The loops for adjusting the datetime based on remaining business hours may not be correctly handling all cases.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function likely arises due to incorrect calculations and logic for adjusting the datetime value based on the provided business hours offset. This could lead to incorrect adjustments in scenarios where the datetime is supposed to be shifted by a certain number of business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensure that the conditions for positive and negative values of `n` are properly handled.
3. Verify that the loops for adjusting the datetime based on remaining business hours cover all possible scenarios.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)  # adjust to move to previous business day
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        for _ in range(abs(r)):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while other.time() not in self.start:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                while other.time() not in self.end:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the logic for adjusting the datetime value based on business days and remaining business hours. I also made changes to correctly handle the positive and negative cases of the provided offset. Furthermore, I simplified the adjustment process within loops to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours.
