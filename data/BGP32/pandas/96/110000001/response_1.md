## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given datetime object according to business hour offsets. The function seems to have issues with correctly handling the adjustments and calculations related to business hours. The bug may be due to incorrect logic or incorrect handling of different cases within the function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of positive and negative offsets.
2. Incorrect calculation of business days (`bd` variable).
3. Incorrect adjustment of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain` variable).
4. Incorrect comparison and operation in the while loops.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function seems to cause incorrect adjustments when shifting the provided datetime object based on the business hours. This could lead to incorrect results and unexpected behavior, especially when transitioning across different business intervals or with positive/negative offsets.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Correctly calculate the number of business days to adjust.
3. Ensure accurate adjustment of remaining business hours within each business time interval.
4. Carefully handle comparisons and operations within the while loops to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour.seconds // 60 <= r:
                        other += bhour
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour.seconds // 60 >= r or (bhour.seconds // 60 == r and nanosecond !=0):
                        other += bhour
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    else:
                        other = other - timedelta(minutes=-r)
                        r = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, I made adjustments to the handling of positive and negative offsets, corrected the calculation and adjustment of business days, and ensured accurate adjustment of remaining business hours within each business time interval.
