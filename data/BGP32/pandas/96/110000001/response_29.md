The buggy function in the provided code is `apply(self, other)`. The function is intended to apply business hour offset to a given datetime, adjusting it based on the business hours defined by the start and end times.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the adjustment of the datetime `other` to reset the timezone and nanosecond.
2. In the handling of positive and negative offsets (`n`).
3. In the adjustment of business days (`skip_bd`).
4. In the loop that adjusts the remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`).

The cause of the bug in the function is related to the incorrect handling of the business hour offset and the datetime adjustment within different conditional blocks. The adjustments and calculations for positive and negative offsets, business days, and remaining business hours are not properly executed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust the datetime `other` based on the given business hour offset and ensure that the adjustments are consistent for all cases (positive and negative offsets). The logic for handling business days and remaining business hours should also be corrected to produce the correct output.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, I simplified and adjusted the logic for positive and negative offsets. I removed unnecessary calculations related to business days and remaining business hours to ensure a more straightforward approach to applying the business hour offset to the datetime.
