## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin`. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect results.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The calculation for adjusting business days (`bd`) seems to have a logical error, where negative business days may not be handled correctly.
2. The adjustment of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) is complex and may not cover all edge cases properly.
3. The conditions within the while loops for adjusting business hours may not be reliable.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of negative business days (`bd`) and the potentially flawed logic for adjusting remaining business hours.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure correctness in all cases. Simplifying the logic and ensuring edge cases are handled properly will be crucial.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
   
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self.end_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self.start_time
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond == 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours have been simplified and should now cover more edge cases correctly. Make sure to retest the function thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.
