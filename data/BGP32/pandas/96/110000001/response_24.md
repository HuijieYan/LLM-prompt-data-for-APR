## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the class.
3. The bug seems to be related to the wrong adjustment of business hours and handling of business days.
4. The bug occurs when calculating remaining business hours to adjust.
5. The bug causes incorrect adjustment of the datetime object, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to make adjustments in the logic related to handling remaining business hours after adjusting business days. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct business hours are subtracted during each iteration of the while loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle the remaining business hours based on the direction of adjustment (positive or negative business hours). This should fix the bug and provide the expected behavior of adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.
