### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets. The function is supposed to calculate the new datetime value after adjusting for the specified business hours.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function is trying to access `nanosecond` attribute directly on the `other` datetime object, which may not always be present.
2. The logic to adjust the business hours is not handling all possible scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect results.
3. The function is raising an `ApplyTypeError` when the input is not a datetime object, but the error message is misleading.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `nanosecond` attribute, improper adjustment for negative business hours, and inadequate logic for handling business hour adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `nanosecond` attribute is available on the datetime object before accessing it.
2. Revise the logic for adjusting business hours for both positive and negative cases to ensure correct results.
3. Improve error handling to provide a more descriptive error message when the input is not a datetime object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Business hour can only be combined with datetime objects")

    n = self.n

    nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
    other = datetime(
        other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
    )

    if n > 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    elif n < 0:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
    business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)

    if n < 0:
        business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

    other += BusinessDay(n=business_days)

    while remaining_hours != 0:
        if n >= 0:
            next_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            hours_left_in_interval = next_closing_time - other
        else:
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            hours_left_in_interval = next_opening_time - other

        if remaining_hours >= hours_left_in_interval.total_seconds() / 60 or \
                (remaining_hours == hours_left_in_interval.total_seconds() / 60 and nanosecond != 0):
            other += hours_left_in_interval
            remaining_hours = 0
        else:
            other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
            remaining_hours = 0

    return other
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above and provides a more robust and accurate adjustment of datetime values based on business hours.
