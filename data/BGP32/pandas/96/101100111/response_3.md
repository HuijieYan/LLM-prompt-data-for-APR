### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hour logic.
2. The issue occurs when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours containing holidays, leading to more periods generated than expected.
3. The buggy function modifies the input datetime object based on business hours, but the adjustment logic seems to have a flaw that results in additional periods.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the adjustment of datetime objects within business hours correctly without generating extra periods.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the incorrect adjustment and handling of the datetime objects within business hours in the `apply` function. Due to the flawed logic in adjusting the datetime objects according to business hours, the function ends up producing unexpected output when generating periods using `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of datetime objects within business hours is done correctly.
2. Make necessary modifications to the logic of adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
3. Validate the adjustments made to datetime objects to match the expected behavior when using `pd.date_range`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += skip_bd
    
            remaining_minutes = r
            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_minutes >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                    if remaining_minutes == bhour.seconds // 60 and other.nanosecond != 0:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        remaining_minutes = 0
                    else:
                        other += bhour
                        remaining_minutes -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust datetime objects within business hours without generating extra periods when used with `pd.date_range`.
