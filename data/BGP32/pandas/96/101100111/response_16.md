### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is named `apply`, and it is a method within the class `BusinessHourMixin`. It takes `self` and `other` as parameters, where `other` is expected to be a `datetime` object.
2. The function aims to adjust the input datetime based on business hours and specific configurations like start and end times. It specifically handles cases where adjustments are needed due to the specific business hour configurations.
3. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tests the behavior of generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. The dates generated are expected to follow a specific pattern, but due to the bug, the dates stray from the expected output.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of business hours and holidays is handled within the `apply` function, causing unexpected shifts in the generated date ranges.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from how adjustments are made within the `apply` function based on the input datetime and the specified business hour configurations. The handling of negative offsets and holiday adjustments seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected results in the generated date ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, consider the following:
1. Refactor the logic within the `apply` function to correctly adjust the input datetime based on the business hour configurations, including handling negative offsets and holiday adjustments.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic is consistent and accurately reflects the intended behavior of the business hours and holidays specified.
3. Test the corrected function against the failing test case to ensure that the generated date ranges align with the expected output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# Corrected implementation of the apply method
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust for nanosecond and time zone to prevent edge conditions
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )
        
        # Adjust other based on n value and business hour offsets
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Calculate business days and remaining hours based on n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # Calculate and apply remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should address the bug and align the generated date ranges with the expected output based on the provided test cases.
