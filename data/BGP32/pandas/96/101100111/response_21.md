### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to work with datetime inputs and adjust them based on business hours, skipping holidays, and working hours.
2. The function `apply` seems to be misinterpreting the increment logic causing unexpected results.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` checks the behavior of date_range with custom business hours and holidays, where the results are unexpected.
4. The expected behavior is to handle the provided holidays correctly while generating the date range without skipping any expected timestamps.
5. The bug could be within the logic for adjusting business hours, holidays, or the incrementation logic within the function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is most likely present in the logic related to handling holidays and adjusting the business hours within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles calculating the next opening time after a holiday occurs. This causes the function to increment the date inappropriately and produce incorrect results.

### Suggested Fix:
Adjust the logic for incrementing the dates based on holidays by ensuring that the dates are correctly adjusted and holidays are properly accounted for during the date range generation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                current_date = other.date()
                if current_date in self.holidays:
                    if n > 0:
                        other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                    else:
                        other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
                else:
                    n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1
                    if n != 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes logic to properly handle holidays and adjust the dates accordingly based on the business hours.
