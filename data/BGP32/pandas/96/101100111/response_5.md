### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours, holidays, and other factors.
- The function makes several calculations and adjustments to determine the new datetime based on the input datetime and the specified business hours.
- The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to generate a date range using a custom business hour offset with specified holidays. However, due to the bug in the `apply` function, the date range is not generated correctly when holidays are involved.

### Bug Location:
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of datetime objects to handle holidays in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function fails to correctly adjust datetime objects when encountering holidays, leading to incorrect calculations for the new datetime.
- The incorrect handling of holidays results in an incorrect date range being produced in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug fix should involve revising the holiday handling logic within the `apply` function to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours.

            return other
        else:

```

### The bug is fixed by updating the handling of holidays and the adjustment logic of the datetime object based on business hours within the `apply` function.
