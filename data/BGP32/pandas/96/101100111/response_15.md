### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets` module of pandas.
2. The function takes a `datetime` object `other` as input and performs calculations based on the business hour offset.
3. The function is failing for specific inputs related to working with custom business hours and holidays, leading to unexpected output in `date_range` scenarios.
4. The key issue seems to be in the logic within the function where adjustments related to holidays and business hours calculation are not properly handled.
5. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to generate a date range using custom business hours with holidays, producing the correct expected result. However, the buggy function is not returning the expected output.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug in the `apply` function is related to the incorrect handling of holidays and adjustments within business hours calculations.
2. The logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on holidays is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in scenarios with holidays.
3. The handling of the number of business days, remaining business hours, and transitions between business time intervals is not optimal, resulting in undesired outcomes.
4. Due to these issues, the function is unable to correctly adjust the datetime for custom business hours with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the logic related to holiday adjustment to correctly handle holidays in the business hours calculation.
2. Check the calculations related to the number of business days and remaining business hours for accurate adjustments.
3. Ensure proper transitions between business time intervals in both positive and negative `n` cases to achieve the desired result.
4. Refactor the adjustment process to align with the expected behavior when working with custom business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHourMixin, ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holiday_flag = False
            
            # Check if the current datetime is a holiday
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                holiday_flag = True
            
            # Adjust the current datetime based on the holiday flag
            if holiday_flag:
                other = self.next_bday(next_day=True, do_holidays=True)
            else:
                other = self.next_bday(next_day=True, do_holidays=False)
                while n > 0:
                    other = self.next_bday(next_day=False, do_holidays=False)
                    n -= 1
            
            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic related to holidays, business days adjustment, and business hours calculation, the revised `apply` function should now handle custom business hours correctly, aligned with the expected behavior in `date_range` scenarios with holidays.
