### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on the specified business hours. However, due to incorrect logic, the function fails to adjust the datetime object correctly, leading to unexpected output.

#### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect conditional checks for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours.
2. Incorrect handling of business days when adjusting the datetime object.

### Explaining the Bug

The buggy function `apply` fails to correctly adjust the input datetime based on the specified business hours. This results in the output datetime being incorrect, causing the failing test described in the GitHub issue.

The main cause of the bug is the inappropriate handling of adjustments when the provided datetime is not aligned with the specified business hours. This leads to miscalculations in adjusting the datetime, ultimately resulting in incorrect output.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic responsible for recalculating the adjusted datetime based on the business hours. Correcting the conditional checks and the business day adjustments in the function will help in producing the expected output.

Additionally, ensuring that the adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values (number of business hours to advance or retreat) are handled appropriately is crucial in fixing this bug.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug described above:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    if bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine the business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the conditional checks, ensuring proper adjustments for positive and negative business hours, and fixing the logic for adjusting business days, the corrected `apply` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
