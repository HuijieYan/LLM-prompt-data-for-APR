### Analysis:
In the buggy function `apply`, there are issues with adjusting the timestamps to business hours and handling holidays, resulting in incorrect output. The function tries to adjust the timestamp to the next or previous opening time based on the given conditions but doesn't handle holidays correctly, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the given timestamp when holidays are involved. It does not account for holidays during the adjustment process, leading to the generation of incorrect dates.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the timestamp adjustment process considers holidays during both forward and backward adjustments.
2. Make sure that the adjustment to the next or previous business day is appropriately handled when holidays are encountered.
3. Verify that the function correctly adjusts the timestamp based on the required business hours without skipping over holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n > 0:
                while other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )

                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        bhour = (
                            self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        )
                    
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check for holidays during the adjustment of the timestamp in both the forward and backward directions.
2. Adjusted the logic to handle holidays appropriately when moving to the next or previous opening time.
3. Updated the adjustment process to consider holidays and ensure correct positioning within the business hours.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle holidays correctly and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
