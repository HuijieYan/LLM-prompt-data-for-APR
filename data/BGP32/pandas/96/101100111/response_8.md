### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The function is designed to apply custom business hours to a given datetime parameter.
- The provided failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to test if the function works correctly with custom business hours and holidays.
- The failing test indicates that the function produces unexpected results when adding holidays, generating more periods than expected.

### Bug:
- The bug is likely related to how the function handles adjusting the datetime with respect to holidays.
- The bug is causing the function to generate more periods than specified in the test when holidays are included with custom business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
- The issue seems to be with the adjustment of the datetime when holidays are involved. The adjustment logic needs to be corrected to avoid the deviation from the expected number of periods.
- Ensure that the function correctly accounts for holidays and adjusts the datetime calculation accordingly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,

                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic related to handling holidays and datetime adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected behavior.
