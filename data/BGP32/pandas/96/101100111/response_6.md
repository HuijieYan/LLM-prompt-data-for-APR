### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a part of the `CustomBusinessHour` functionality in pandas.
2. The function is supposed to apply custom business hours to a given datetime object, skipping non-business hours and holidays.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the custom business hours, resulting in incorrect periods generated in the `date_range`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with the function's behavior when holidays are added, leading to an incorrect number of periods generated in the `date_range`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is caused by the logic in the `apply` function that adjusts the given datetime object based on the custom business hours' start and end times, along with consideration for holidays.
- The logic within the function for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, holidays, and non-business hours leads to miscalculated adjustments, resulting in unexpected time intervals in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align the behavior of the `apply` function with the expected output:
1. Refactor the logic for adjusting the datetime object inside the `apply` function.
2. Ensure correct handling of holidays, business hours, and non-business hours.
3. Fix the adjustment calculations to correctly skip over non-business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas import Timestamp
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        skip_duration = timedelta(0)
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_duration)
                skip_duration = timedelta(0)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other + skip_duration)
                skip_duration = timedelta(0)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the fixed version of the `apply` function, the issues related to incorrect period generation when using holidays with business hours should be resolved. The corrected function assures that the custom business hours are applied correctly to the given datetime object while considering holidays for accurate time adjustments.
