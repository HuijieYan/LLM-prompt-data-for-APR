The bug in the provided function `apply` seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hour offsets. The issue occurs when dealing with holidays, leading to an incorrect adjustment of the datetime period within the custom business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the function to miscalculate the adjustment needed for the custom business hour frequency when holidays are involved. This results in incorrect periods being generated for the date range, as observed in the failing test case.

The function does not handle the holiday parameter properly, which leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range when holidays are specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling holidays within the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment of business hours should consider holidays and adjust the datetime periods accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

# Corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            bhour_remain = 0
            curr_datetime = other

            while n != 0:
                curr_datetime += self
                if curr_datetime.date() in self.holidays:
                    continue
                n -= np.sign(self.n)

            return curr_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, we ensure to adjust the datetime periods correctly considering holidays and custom business hours. This modification should address the issue raised in the failing test case related to generating periods with holidays in the date range.
