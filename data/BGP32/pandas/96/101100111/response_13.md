### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function `apply_wraps` is used as a decorator for the `apply` function to apply certain operations.
3. The function `apply` is intended to adjust the provided datetime object based on business hours and other criteria.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to verify the behavior of creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency including holidays.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the `apply` function, causing unexpected results in the date ranges.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the provided datetime object when considering holidays.
2. The calculation and adjustment logic within the `apply` function are leading to incorrect offsets and unexpected results when holidays are involved.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function processes holidays when adjusting the datetime object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustment of the datetime object when holidays are present.
2. Ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours considers the presence of holidays while calculating offsets.
3. Test the corrected function with the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to ensure it produces the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
