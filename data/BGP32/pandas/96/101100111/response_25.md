### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method under the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The `apply` function is expected to handle business hours offset adjustments based on the input `other` datetime, but it currently produces incorrect results.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` showcases the bug where the date range generation with a custom business hour offset and holidays does not produce the expected output.
4. The bug causes the date range to be extended beyond the expected periods due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function's logic.
5. The GitHub issue related to this bug indicates an incorrect behavior when adding periods with holidays in the date range generation using custom business hour offsets.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be related to the way adjustments are made based on the given business hours offset, n value, and holiday considerations. Proper calculation and handling of adjustments are required.
2. The adjustments involving adding/subtracting business days, calculating remaining business hours, and moving between time intervals need to be reviewed and corrected.
3. Focus on addressing the adjustment logic for both positive and negative n values under various conditions.
4. Ensure that the returned datetime aligns correctly with the applied custom business hour logic and respects the specified holidays.

### Bug-Fixed Version of the `apply` Method:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.strftime('%H:%M') in [st.strftime('%H:%M') for st in self.end] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.strftime('%H:%M') in [st.strftime('%H:%M') for st in self.start]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments to the logic as suggested above, the corrected version of the `apply` method should now address the bug and produce the expected output for the failing test case.
