**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `offsets.py` file of `pandas` package is responsible for the incorrect behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom holidays.
   
2. The function tries to adjust the given timestamp based on custom business hours, but the logic within the function is incorrect, leading to unexpected output when working with periods and holidays.

3. The bug in the `apply` function causes unexpected shifts in timestamps when holidays are involved, resulting in more periods than expected. This behavior is not desired when working with business hours.
   
4. To fix the bug, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be corrected so that the timestamp adjustments respect the custom business hours and holidays correctly.

By correcting the logic within the `apply` function based on the expected values and types of variables, we can address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `pd.date_range` works correctly with custom business hours and holidays.
