### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a `datetime` object based on the specified business hours, holidays, and other conditions. The function contains several logical branches and calculations to handle different scenarios. The buggy behavior reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the function is not correctly adjusting the dates when holidays are involved.

### Issues:
1. The function does not seem to correctly handle the adjustment of dates when a holiday is present, leading to unexpected results.
2. The function may have a logic issue in the calculation of business days (`bd`) and remaining minutes (`r`).
3. There could be problems with the adjustments made based on `n` and whether `other` is on an offset. 

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly adjust the dates when holidays are involved, leading to incorrect results in the output dates. This could be due to a miscalculation in the adjustment logic that considers holidays in the business hour calculation.

### Suggested Fix:
To address the buggy behavior, a systematic approach needs to be taken to correctly adjust the dates while considering holidays and other factors. It is crucial to ensure that the adjustment logic is correct and handles all edge cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, "freq"):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other, freq=self.freq)

        n = self.n
        freq_minutes = int(self.freq.freqstr.replace("CBH", "").replace("H", ""))
        
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(minutes=freq_minutes)
                if other in self.holidays or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    while other in self.holidays or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(minutes=freq_minutes)
                if other in self.holidays or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    while other in self.holidays or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version focuses on properly adjusting the dates by incrementing or decrementing by the frequency minutes while considering holidays and offsets. The code addresses the reported bug and should pass the failing test case related to custom holidays.

By adopting this corrected version, the function should behave as expected and produce the correct output dates even when holidays are included in the calculation.
