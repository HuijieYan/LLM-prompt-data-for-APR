### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours and holidays.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates the issue when using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays, resulting in unexpected periods in the output.
3. By observing the expected values and types of variables provided for different cases, we can see that the buggy function is not correctly handling the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where date_range behaves unexpectedly when combining CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to originate from incorrect handling of adjustments related to business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` fails to correctly adjust timestamps for business days and remaining business hours, leading to unexpected periods when combining CustomBusinessHour with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust the timestamps for business days.
2. Manage the remaining business hours adjustments accurately to align with custom business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Buggy apply function is corrected with adjustments for business days and remaining hours
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as outlined in the corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing unexpected behavior when combining CustomBusinessHour with holidays should be resolved.
