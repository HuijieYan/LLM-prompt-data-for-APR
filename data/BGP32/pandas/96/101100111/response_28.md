### Analysis
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The `apply()` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is decorated with the `@apply_wraps` decorator.
3. The `apply()` function is supposed to adjust a given datetime according to business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to using custom business hours with holidays and generating date ranges.
5. The failing test expects specific date ranges but receives incorrect values due to the buggy behavior in the `apply()` function.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs when adjusting the datetime `other` based on business hours and holidays. The adjustment logic within the `apply()` function is faulty.
2. The adjustment calculations for moving `other` to the next opening time, getting closing time, applying business days, and adjusting remaining business hours are incorrect.
3. The calculations are causing the date ranges to include invalid dates and skip over expected dates based on holidays and business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the adjustment logic to handle the movement of `other` within valid business hours and respecting holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments take into account the start time, closing time, and holiday restrictions as required.
3. Validate each step of the adjustment process to ensure that the datetime is adjusted correctly according to the business rules.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries import offsets

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_time = datetime(2000, 1, 1, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute, 0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute - 1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = offsets.BusinessDay(bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                current_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                time_diff = current_closing_time - other
                if bhour_remain < time_diff:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= time_diff
                    other = self._next_opening_time(current_closing_time)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply()` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, the corrected version should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test scenario.
