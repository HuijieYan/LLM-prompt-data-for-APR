### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` module's `offsets.py` file.
2. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is decorated with `apply_wraps`.
3. The function aims to adjust the given timestamp based on business hours, particularly handling cases where holidays are involved.
4. The failing test cases involve creating a date range with custom business hours, where unexpected additional periods are observed when holidays are added.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles holidays during the adjustment process.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `apply` adjusts the given timestamp based on business hours and holidays.
2. It seems the error lies in how holidays are handled, causing inaccuracies in calculating the number of periods in the date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment process properly accounts for holidays in the business day calculation.
2. Verify that the adjustment mechanism works correctly when encountering holidays to prevent the issue of additional periods in the date range.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
# Import the necessary modules for the bug-fixed function
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# Fix the buggy function by improving holiday handling
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on n value and business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Handle holidays appropriately
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday().apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the holiday handling logic and adjusting the business day calculations, the bug in the `apply` function should now be resolved for accurate adjustment of timestamps based on business hours and holidays.
