### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to the behavior of the `date_range` method when using a custom business frequency with holidays specified. The current implementation of the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class is causing the unexpected behavior of producing more periods than specified when holidays are introduced.

### Error Location
The primary error occurs in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class, specifically in the logic for adjusting the dates based on the specified business hours.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from incorrect date adjustments within the `apply` method. The adjustment logic based on the number of business days and remaining business hours is flawed, leading to incorrect date outputs when dealing with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` method needs to be revised to properly handle holidays and adjust the dates according to the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        adjusted_dt = other
        while n != 0:
            adjusted_dt = self._adjust_date(adjusted_dt, n)
            n = 1 if n > 0 else -1
    
        return adjusted_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_date(self, dt, n):
    adjusted_dt = dt
    while n != 0:
        adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt) if n > 0 else self._get_closing_time(adjusted_dt)
        n = 1 if n > 0 else -1
    
    return adjusted_dt
```

By improving the adjustment logic and separating it into a helper method `_adjust_date`, we ensure that the correct adjustments are made for each date, considering holidays and the specified business hours.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `date_range` method works as expected even with holidays specified in the custom business frequency.
