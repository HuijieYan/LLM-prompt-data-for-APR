### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The bug causes unexpected behavior in the generation of date ranges with custom business hours and holidays, leading to issues like the number of periods exceeding the expected value.
3. The bug involves incorrect handling of business days and business hours within the function, leading to miscounting of periods and inconsistencies.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustments related to business days, business hours calculations, and adjustment loops need to be refined to ensure accurate calculations and handling of custom business hours and holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check and correct the adjustments related to business days handling within the function.
2. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours and proper handling of custom business hours and holidays.
3. Modify the adjustment loops to ensure correct period count and adherence to specified business hours.
4. Verify that the function returns the expected output for all test cases provided.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Import necessary functions and classes from the pandas module
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, date):
            if self.n == 0:
                return other

            other = datetime.combine(other, time(other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond))
            n = self.n

            if n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            holidays = set(self.holidays)

            def is_holiday(dt):
                return any(dt.date() == holiday for holiday in holidays)

            def next_bday(dt):
                while True:
                    dt += timedelta(days=1)
                    if dt.weekday() < 5 and not is_holiday(dt):
                        return dt

            bd = n // self.business_days
            r = n % self.business_days

            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                other = next_bday(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            target_shift = r * 60 * 60
            current_time = other.hour * 3600 + other.minute * 60 + other.second

            target_time = target_shift if n > 0 else -target_shift

            while target_time != 0:
                business_time = business_hours - current_time

                if abs(business_time) >= abs(target_time):
                    current_time += target_time
                    target_time = 0
                else:
                    target_time -= business_time

                    if n > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=business_time))
                    else:
                        ptime = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(ptime - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with date")
```

### Result:
The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues related to the incorrect handling of business days, business hours, and holidays. By improving the calculation logic and adjustment mechanisms, the corrected function should now provide the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
