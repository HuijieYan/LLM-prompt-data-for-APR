### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime value based on custom business hours, holidays, and other parameters. It contains logic to handle positive and negative cases for adjusting the datetime value.
2. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses the buggy function in the context of custom business hours and holidays. The test compares the output of `pd.date_range` with a custom frequency that includes holidays to an expected `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug causes the output of the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when combining periods, custom business hours, and holidays. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this problem by showing that adding holidays results in more periods than expected.
4. The bug seems to stem from the logic in the `apply` function incorrectly handling adjustments for holidays, likely leading to incorrect datetime calculations.
5. To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be reviewed to ensure proper handling of holidays and adjustments based on business hours. The function should consider holidays when calculating business days and adjust the output accordingly.

### Code Fix:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Using replace to keep the timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        while not self.is_on_offset(other):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjustments based on business hours, the corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected outputs.
