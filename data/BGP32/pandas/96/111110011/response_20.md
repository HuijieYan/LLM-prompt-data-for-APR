### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours specified. It tries to manipulate the input datetime object to align it with business hours, handle business days, and adjust remaining business hours.
2. The function interacts with several internal functions `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset`.
3. The failing test revealed an issue where applying business hours from a given datetime was producing unexpected results, possibly due to improper handling of holidays.
4. The error message indicated a problem in validating the frequency of the `DatetimeIndex` with a custom frequency (`CustomBusinessHour`), leading to a `ValueError`.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles adjustments for holidays and aligns the output datetime object based on the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic related to holiday handling in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that adjustments respect holidays and business hours accurately.
3. Confirm that the output datetime objects align with the expected business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # Logic to adjust datetime for business hours taking holidays into account
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Handle business days adjustment
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            bd, r = (-bd, -r) if n < 0 else (bd, r)
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n >= 0:
                    other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain if bhour_remain <= bhour else bhour
                    bhour_remain = max(bhour_remain - bhour, timedelta(0))
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle business hours with holidays, the corrected version aims to address the issue reported in the failing test case and the related GitHub issue.
