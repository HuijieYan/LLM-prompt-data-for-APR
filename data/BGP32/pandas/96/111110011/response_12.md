### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when using `pd.date_range` with CustomBusinessHour frequencies and holidays.
2. The error message indicates a problem with frequency validation and the number of periods generated when using the buggy function.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays generates unexpected results.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle business days and business hours adjustments.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjusting the condition for negative n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Adjusting for business day skipping
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    # Adjusting for business hours
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    else:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### By applying the corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue should be resolved, and `pd.date_range` should work correctly with CustomBusinessHour frequencies and holidays.
