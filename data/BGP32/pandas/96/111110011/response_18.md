### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module is responsible for adjusting date and time values based on business hours. The bug seems to be causing unexpected results when used in combination with custom business hour offsets including holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling adjustments when `n` (number of business hours) is negative.
2. Logic for moving to the previous business day.
3. Adjustment of remaining business hours.
4. Handling different business time intervals.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes unexpected behavior when adjusting date and time values based on business hours, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated, especially when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling negative `n` values and moving to the previous business day.
2. Correctly adjust the remaining business hours to align with business intervals.
3. Ensure proper handling of holiday offsets within the business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handling edge conditions
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other - skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other - skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain += bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function with adjusted logic for handling date and time adjustments based on business hours, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
