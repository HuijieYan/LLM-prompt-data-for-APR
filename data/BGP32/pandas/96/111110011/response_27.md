### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the given datetime based on business hours. The error occurs when using `pd.date_range()` with a `CustomBusinessHour` object that includes holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours, as it fails to properly handle the case when holidays are present.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the mishandling of holidays in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect adjustment of the datetime object. This results in more periods being generated in the test case, causing the equality check to fail, leading to a `ValueError`.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug**:
   - Modify the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
   - Ensure that the adjustment logic correctly accounts for holidays to avoid generating additional periods.
   - Test the updated function with the failing test to validate the fix.

### Updated Code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.is_on_offset(other):  # Check if the given datetime is a business hour
            return other
        
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(hours=1)  # Move to the previous business day
        
        while True:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)  # Move to the next hour
        
            # Check for business hours and holidays
            if other.time() in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                businesshours -= 60  # Decrement available business hours
                is_holiday = getattr(self, 'holidays', []) and other.date().isoformat() in self.holidays
                if businesshours <= 0 or is_holiday:
                    break  # Exit loop on end of business hours or holiday
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The updated version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust the given datetime based on business hours and holidays, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report. This fix should pass the failing test case and address the bug related to the holiday handling.
