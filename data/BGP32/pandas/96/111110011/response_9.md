## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to apply custom business hours to a datetime object. The issue arises when there are custom holidays involved, causing the `date_range` function to return unexpected results. The error message indicates a value error because the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The GitHub issue confirms that there is an inconsistency in the output of `date_range` when using custom business hours with periods and holidays.

## Bug Identification:
The bug lies in how the custom business hours and holidays are handled within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect adjustments and unexpected output when generating date ranges.

## Bug Explanation:
The issue arises from the logic within the `apply` function when adjusting the input datetime based on custom business hours and holidays. The adjustments are not correctly accounting for the impact of holidays, causing the generated date ranges to contain more periods than expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the input datetime based on custom business hours, holidays, and periods. It's essential to ensure that the adjustments properly account for holidays to avoid the unexpected output observed during the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# assume other imports are still available

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = as_datetime(other)

            # adjust other based on business hours
            start_time = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
            
            for i in range(abs(n)):
                forward = n >= 0
                if forward:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while next_open.date() in self.holidays:
                        next_open = self._next_opening_time(next_open)
                    other = next_open
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    while prev_open.date() in self.holidays:
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(prev_open)
                    other = prev_open

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to consider the presence of holidays when determining the next opening or closing time. This ensures that the generated date ranges align properly with the specified business hours and holidays.

By applying this correction, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
