### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` and utilizes several internal functions from the same class to compute business hours and adjust datetime objects accordingly.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is calling `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays, but the output does not match the expected values.
3. The error message points to a ValueError raised during frequency validation, specifically stating that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency in `pd.date_range` results in unexpected additional periods being generated.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the custom business hour frequency calculation in `apply` method, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments and extended periods in the output.
2. Due to issues in adjusting for holidays while calculating business hours and adjusting datetime objects, the generated periods are incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the handling of holidays within the `apply` function to accurately adjust datetime objects according to the custom business hour frequency while considering holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime objects aligns with the specified business hours and avoids unnecessary periods being added due to improper adjustment logic.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjusting datetime to handle edge conditions
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                # Handling for forward business hour calculation
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Handling for backward business hour calculation
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Business hours calculation and adjustment
            new_date = other
            counter = 0
            while counter < abs(n):
                new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                if not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                    new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                counter += 1
    
            return new_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying these corrections should resolve the issue with incorrect periods being generated when using a custom business hour frequency with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
