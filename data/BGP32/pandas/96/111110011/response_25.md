### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `BusinessHourMixin` is responsible for the incorrect behavior in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` failing test.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` attempts to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays but generates more periods than expected due to incorrect handling.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequencies when creating the expected DatetimeIndex.
4. The bug is caused by improper adjustment of business days, remaining business hours, and next opening/closing times in the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of business days and business hours is correctly performed based on positive/negative `n` values.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the next opening/closing times to avoid exceeding the specified end time.
3. Align the calculations in the `apply` function to accurately handle business days and business hours based on the specified input.
4. Consider the cases of holidays affecting business days and ensure correct adjustments.
5. Update the `apply` function to handle the edge cases and adjust the timestamps accordingly.

### Bug-fixed `apply` Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if next_open_time > other:
                        other = next_open_time
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    next_bd = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    other = skip_bd.rollforward(next_bd)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections in the `apply` function, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass successfully.
