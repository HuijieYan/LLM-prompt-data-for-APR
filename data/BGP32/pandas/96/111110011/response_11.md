### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly handling the adjustment of dates when working with custom business hours and holidays.
2. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is showing unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message indicates a problem with frequency validation, specifically relating to inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency when holidays are involved.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays is producing unexpected results and exceeding the expected number of periods.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The fix involves ensuring that the adjustment of dates within the `apply(self, other)` function correctly accounts for holidays and maintains the desired number of periods.
2. The frequency validation check needs to be improved to handle the case when holidays are present, delivering the expected behavior for generating date ranges with custom business hours.
3. By updating the logic related to adjusting the dates, the bug should be resolved, and the test case should pass with the corrected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust the time zones and nanoseconds
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if self.is_on_offset(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculate business hours in a day for adjustment
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first, accounting for holidays
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` function should pass successfully without exceeding the expected number of periods as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
