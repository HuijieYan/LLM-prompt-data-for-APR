### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is causing the failing test in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function due to a bug related to custom business hours.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation, indicating a discrepancy between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that adding holidays while using `periods` in `date_range` leads to unexpected behavior with more than the specified number of periods being generated, which aligns with the failure observed in the test.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the custom business hours are handled within the `apply` function, causing incorrect frequency generation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle business hours and holidays.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # handle negative offset
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = prev_opening
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # adjust for business days
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))
        business_day_shift = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_day_shift = (-business_day_shift[0], -business_day_shift[1])

        if business_day_shift[0] != 0:
            skip_days = BusinessDay(n=business_day_shift[0])
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_days
            else:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=24) + skip_days

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=business_day_shift[1])

        while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
            start_time = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other)
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(start_time)
            work_hours = closing_time - other if n >= 0 else start_time - other
            if abs(work_hours) <= remaining_hours:
                other = closing_time if n >= 0 else start_time
                remaining_hours -= abs(work_hours)
            else:
                other = other + remaining_hours
                remaining_hours = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version aims to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours and holidays to ensure the `date_range` function behaves as expected with custom business hours.

By incorporating these changes, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function should now pass without raising any errors, resolving the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
