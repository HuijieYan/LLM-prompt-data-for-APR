### Bug Analysis:
1. The provided test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is intended to test the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours with holidays included.
2. The failing test indicates that when generating a date range with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays, the resulting number of periods is incorrect.
3. The error message points towards a frequency validation issue within the `pandas` library when working with Datetime arrays.
4. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `offsets.py` might be causing the improper calculation of dates in the presence of holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to improper adjustment of dates within the `apply` method when handling holidays. This results in the incorrect number of periods being generated when using a CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic inside the `apply` function correctly adjusts dates when holidays are encountered. This adjustment should take into account the existence of holidays to generate the expected number of periods in the result.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `offsets.py`:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    else:
                        n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the handling of holidays and the calculation of periods within the `apply` function, this corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass.
