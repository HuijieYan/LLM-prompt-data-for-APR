## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The `apply` function is called with a `datetime` object named `other`.
3. The function seems to handle business hours and adjust the given `datetime` object based on certain conditions like the number of business days and specific business time intervals.
4. The provided failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a custom business hour frequency with a start time and a holiday, then generates a date range for 4 periods and checks it against an expected result.
5. The error message indicates a validation error related to frequency mismatch.

## Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business hours within the `apply` function. The way business days are handled, along with the adjustment for remaining business hours, may lead to incorrect results when encountering holidays.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are considered correctly during the adjustment process of the business hours. This can be achieved by modifying the logic that handles the adjustment based on business days and remaining business hours.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            original_other = other
            while True:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if other == original_other:
                            break  # Prevent infinite loop
                    else:
                        break
                else:
                    break
        else:
            original_other = other
            while True:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    else:
                        break
            original_other = other

        # Remaining logic remains the same
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
- The adjustment of business hours now includes checking whether the adjusted time falls on a holiday before proceeding.
- This change should prevent the issue with the failing test related to holidays affecting the generated date range.
