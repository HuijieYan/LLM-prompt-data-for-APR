### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is used to apply the business hour offset to a given datetime.
2. The issue arises when a CustomBusinessHour offset with holidays is used in the `pd.date_range`.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates the problem by showing unexpected periods being generated due to the holidays.
4. The error message indicates a validation issue related to frequency incompatibility between the datetime index and the specified frequency.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the `date_range` function does not work as expected when using periods along with holidays.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, where adjustments based on business days and business hours are not handling holidays correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of datetime values when encountering holidays while applying the business hour offset.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling business days and business hours to correctly account for holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments maintain the expected behavior of the CustomBusinessHour offset while factoring in holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            adjusted_other = other
            
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                    if adjusted_other in self.holidays:
                        adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                    else:
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other, sign=-1)
                    if adjusted_other in self.holidays:
                        adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other, sign=-1)
                    else:
                        n += 1
                
            return adjusted_other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this corrected version of the `apply` function should fix the issue with applying CustomBusinessHour offsets with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
