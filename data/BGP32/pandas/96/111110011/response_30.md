### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The bug causes unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message suggests that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency due to `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when adding holidays to the custom business hours, the `date_range` function produces more periods than expected.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hours calculation handles holidays correctly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how holidays are handled within the custom business hours calculation. Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # code mostly similar to the buggy version, with holiday handling changes
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and 'holidays' in self.kwds:
                holidays = self.kwds['holidays']
                if other in holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            # the rest of the function remains the same ...
```

This fix ensures that when a custom business hour with holidays is used, the `apply` function correctly adjusts the date and time handling to account for holidays and avoid the issue of extra periods in the `date_range` function.

By implementing this fix, the function should pass the failing test and address the reported issue on GitHub.
