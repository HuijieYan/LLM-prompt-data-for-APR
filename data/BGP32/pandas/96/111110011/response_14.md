## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of business hours when handling custom business hours with holidays.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is detecting the problem.
4. The error message indicates a validation error stating that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).
5. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where adding holidays results in incorrect date ranges.

## Error Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of holidays during the adjustment of business hours within the `apply` method. It leads to the generation of more periods than expected due to improper calculations involving business hours and holidays.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business hours correctly accounts for holidays and does not generate unexpected periods. The adjustments should consider the presence of holidays in determining the correct date ranges.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust timezone and nanoseconds, ignore timestamp replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.business_trading_holidays)
                
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self.next_opening_time(other)
                    other += CustomBusinessDay(n=1, holidays=self.business_trading_holidays) + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_time = self.next_opening_time(other)
                remaining_time = next_time - other
                if remaining_time > bhour_remain or remaining_time == bhour_remain:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= remaining_time
                    other = self.next_opening_time(next_time)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the business hours considering holidays correctly, ensuring that the resulting periods are as expected and aligned with the custom business hours provided.
