### Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust datetime objects by business hours based on a specific offset. The issue arises when a holiday is introduced in the calculation, causing the function to generate more periods than expected. This issue is reflected in the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` where the calculated result differs from the expected output due to the incorrect adjustment of holidays.

The main cause of the bug seems to be the handling of holidays within the `apply` function. When encountering a holiday during the adjustment process, the function does not correctly adjust the datetime object, leading to an incorrect number of periods calculated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly account for holidays while adjusting datetime objects by business hours. The adjustment process should correctly skip over holidays and adjust the datetime object accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Cannot adjust to nanosecond-level granularity")
        
        remaining_hours = self.n
        
        while remaining_hours != 0:
            if remaining_hours > 0:
                if other in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other, self.end) - other
                    remaining_hours -= bhour
                    other += bhour
            else:  # For negative n
                if other in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, other)
                    remaining_hours += bhour
                    other -= bhour
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustment process should now properly handle holidays and result in the expected number of periods in the output.
