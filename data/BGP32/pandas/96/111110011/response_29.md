### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the offset logic correctly, causing unexpected results when working with `pd.date_range` and custom business hours with holidays.

#### Error Location:
The error occurs within the `apply` function's logic related to adjusting the date based on the business hours and business days.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of business hours and business days adjustments in the `apply` function. This results in the incorrect calculation of the date range with custom business hours and holidays.

#### Proposed Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly adjust the other date based on business hours and business days.
2. Ensure the adjustments consider the specified custom business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Get the nanosecond value if available
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            # Reset timezone and nanosecond to avoid issues with Timestamp
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours per day
            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Adjust for business days
            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

            # Adjust by business days first
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remaining = other - prev_opening
                    other = prev_opening + skip_business_days + remaining
                else:
                    other = other + skip_business_days

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                current_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                hours_diff = self._get_closing_time(current_opening) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if remaining_hours < hours_diff or (remaining_hours == hours_diff and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= hours_diff
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the calculation of the date range with custom business hours and holidays should now produce the expected results without exceeding the specified number of periods.
