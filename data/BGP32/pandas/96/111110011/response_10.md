### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is using `self._next_opening_time(other)` and `self._get_closing_time(other)` to adjust the given datetime `other` according to the business hour offsets. The issue arises when holidays are involved. The function fails to account for holidays properly, which results in incorrect business hours calculation and adjustments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of holidays in business hour adjustments.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours.
3. Incorrect adjustments for business days.
4. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours.
5. Incorrect moving to the next business time interval.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails to adjust the datetime properly when holidays are present, leading to an incorrect calculation of business hours and adjustments. This results in unexpected output in scenarios involving holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Consider holidays in the business hour calculations.
2. Adjust business hours calculation to account for holidays.
3. Ensure correct adjustments for business days including holidays.
4. Properly handle remaining business hours adjustments.
5. Correctly move to the next business time interval.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), 60) if n >= 0 else divmod(-abs(n), 60)
        
        holiday_offset = timedelta(0)
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            for _ in range(bd):
                while other.weekday() >= 5 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
            while other.weekday() >= 5 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)

            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
        for _ in range(r):
            while other.weekday() >= 5 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
            
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour.total_seconds() <= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif bhour.total_seconds() > 60*60:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                other += bhour
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function takes holidays into account, adjusts business hours correctly including holidays, properly handles business days adjustments, and ensures accurate handling of remaining business hours adjustments. It should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case.
