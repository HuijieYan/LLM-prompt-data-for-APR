### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an error in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` located in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
2. The function is supposed to handle applying business hours to a datetime object.
3. The error message shows a ValueError being raised during frequency validation in the `DatetimeIndex`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that using `periods` and adding holidays results in unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of business hours with holidays within the `apply` function. The function is not correctly adjusting the dates based on the provided holidays, leading to incorrect results in the frequency calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays and adjust the dates accordingly. We need to ensure that when holidays are present, the calculation of business hours respects those holidays and adjusts the datetimes accordingly.

### Bug-Fixed Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not CustomBusinessHour().is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + timedelta(days=bd)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Test the fixed version with the failing test
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    freq = CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    pd.testing.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

This version of the `apply` function should address the bug and pass the failing test related to custom holidays.
