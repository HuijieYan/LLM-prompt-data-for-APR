### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays, but it seems to have a logical error causing unexpected behaviors.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates a case where adding holidays to custom business hours results in more periods than expected when creating a date range.
3. The corresponding error message indicates a mismatch in inferred frequency and passed frequency, which implies a discrepancy in how the adjustment is applied, leading to incorrect results.
4. Looking at the GitHub issue, it aligns with the behavior observed in the failing test, where adding holidays shifts the date range unexpectedly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles adjustments when dealing with business hours and holidays. Incorrect adjustments cause the date range to include more periods than intended due to mishandling of holidays within the calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the dates consider holidays correctly to prevent unexpected shifts in the date range.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            n = self.n
            business_hours_in_sec = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_in_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            while bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
                bd -= 1
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
    
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the dates based on business hours and holidays more accurately to avoid the issue observed in the test case. This bug fix should resolve the unexpected behavior related to adding holidays to custom business hours.
