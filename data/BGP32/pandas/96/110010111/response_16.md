### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting the input datetime according to the business hour rules defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function should handle edge cases and adjust the input datetime accordingly.
2. The buggy function has an error because it's not correctly adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours and holidays specified.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This is due to incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the function correspond to the correct business hour intervals, taking into account holidays and other edge cases.
5. The corrected version of the function will address the edge cases and adjust the input datetime correctly for the given business hours and holidays.

### Correction:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay, BusinessMixin
from pandas.core.offsets import apply_wraps, ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the input datetime based on the business hours
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                if n > 0:
                    other = self.roll_forward(other)
                elif n < 0:
                    other = self.roll_backward(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def roll_forward(self, other):
        while True:
            weekmask = (1 << other.weekday()) % 128
            if weekmask & self.weekmask == 0 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                break
        return other

    def roll_backward(self, other):
        while True:
            weekmask = (1 << other.weekday()) % 128
            if weekmask & self.weekmask == 0 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                break
        return other
```

In the corrected version:
- Added new functions `roll_forward` and `roll_backward` to handle the adjustments of the input datetime based on business hours and holidays.
- Updated the main `apply` function to utilize these new functions for handling the adjustments correctly in both directions based on the value of `n`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases, conforming to the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
