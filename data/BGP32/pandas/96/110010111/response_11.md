### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is encountering an error when used with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `pd.date_range` function. This bug is related to the wrong calculation of dates in business hours with holidays.
   
2. The bug seems to be within the logic for adjusting the dates according to business hours, especially when considering holidays. The erroneous behavior is causing the `ValueError` exception to be raised when trying to validate frequencies.

3. The bug is leading to incorrect date adjustments when adding holidays in the frequency setup. The failing test case is related to validating that the frequency of the index matches the custom business hour frequency, but due to incorrect dates, the validation fails.

4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for date adjustments in the `apply` function, particularly focusing on handling holidays in the context of business hours. Correcting the adjustments and ensuring that the date ranges are calculated accurately should resolve this issue.

### Correction:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            total_seconds = n * businesshours // 60
            days, bhour_remain = divmod(total_seconds, 60*60*24)
            
            updated_date = other + timedelta(days=days)
            current_business_time = other.time()
            
            business_dt = datetime(updated_date.year, updated_date.month, updated_date.day, current_business_time.hour, current_business_time.minute, current_business_time.second, current_business_time.microsecond)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if business_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(business_dt):
                    business_dt = self._next_opening_time(business_dt)
            else:
                if business_dt.time() in self.start:
                    business_dt = business_dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                if not self._is_on_offset(business_dt):
                    business_dt = self._next_opening_time(business_dt)
                    business_dt = self._get_closing_time(business_dt)

            return business_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic of adjusting the dates within business hours in the `apply` function, we can ensure that dates are calculated accurately, taking holidays and business hours into account. This corrected version should fix the bug and align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
