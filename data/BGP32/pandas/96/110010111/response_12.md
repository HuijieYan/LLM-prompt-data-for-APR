### Analysis:
1. **Relationship with Buggy Class**: The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class that provides functionality related to business hours.
   
2. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation.

3. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - The buggy function is expected to correctly adjust the timestamp according to business hours.
   - The existing buggy function is not handling the adjustment properly, leading to incorrect results.

4. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The GitHub issue reflects a problem with `date_range` when using periods and adding a holiday, leading to an unexpected number of periods in the output.

### Bug Fixes Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the input timestamp are correct based on the business hours.
2. Verify that the calculations for business days and business hours remaining are accurately implemented.
3. Address any edge cases related to the adjustment logic.

### Updated Implementation:

```python
# Import from the necessary libraries/paths as needed

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

With the corrected implementation, the function should now properly adjust the timestamps according to business hours, resolving the issues identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
