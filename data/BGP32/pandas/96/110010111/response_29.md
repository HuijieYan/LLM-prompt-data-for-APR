## Bug Analysis

The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours, including holidays, specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function checks if the input `other` is a datetime object, performs adjustments based on business hours and holidays, and returns the adjusted datetime.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Calculation of business days `bd` and business hours `r`.
2. Adjustment of business days first, then adjusting remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of business days and business hours in certain cases, leading to the function returning incorrect datetime results. This results in discrepancies flagged during the test execution.

The bug appears to be related to the calculation logic within the function, which might lead to the function improperly adjusting the given `datetime` input when certain conditions are met.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the calculation logic for business days and business hours should be reviewed and corrected to ensure accurate adjustments are made based on the specified business hours and holidays. Additionally, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours should be revised to handle various scenarios appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        bhour_remain = self.n * 60
        if self.n < 0:
            flipped_start = tuple(map(lambda t: datetime.time(24-t.hour, 60-t.minute, 60-t.second), self.start))
            flipped_end = tuple(map(lambda t: datetime.time(24-t.hour, 60-t.minute, 60-t.second), self.end))
            self.start = flipped_end
            self.end = flipped_start

        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            before_hour = False
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)
                before_hour = True

            if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
                while np.busday_count(other.date(), other.date()) == 0 or other.weekday() > 4:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0, 0)

            business_hours = 0
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end):
                business_hours += (en.hour + en.minute / 60) - (st.hour + st.minute / 60)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(bhour_remain), business_hours)

            if self.n < 0:
                bd = -bd
                r = -r

            if bd != 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other, bd, roll)
                bhour_remain -= 60 * 24 * bd

            if r != 0:
                remain_seconds = r * 60
                if r > 0:
                    adjust_func = self._next_opening_time if before_hour else self._prev_opening_time
                else:
                    adjust_func = self._get_closing_time
                while remain_seconds > 0:
                    other = adjust_func(other)
                    bhour_remain -= (other - adjust_func(other)).seconds
                    if r > 0:
                        bhour_remain = max(0, bhour_remain)
                    elif r < 0:
                        bhour_remain = min(0, bhour_remain)
                    r, remain_seconds = divmod(bhour_remain, 60)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues related to holiday handling, business days calculation, and the adjustment of business hours. It adjusts the logic to correctly handle the provided input datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays.
