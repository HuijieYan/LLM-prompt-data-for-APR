### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours, taking into account start and end times. 
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the frequency validation process within the `_validate_frequency` method when interacting with a provided custom business hour frequency.
3. The bug seems to arise when the function is unable to handle holiday dates correctly, causing the number of periods to be miscalculated.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment for holidays and non-business days is handled properly within the `apply` function.
5. The correction involves updating the logic related to holiday detection and adjustments.
6. By addressing the holiday calculations and offset adjustments, we can resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

### Correction:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Initialize variables
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            # Calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust for business days first
            if bd != 0:
                # Adjusted holiday handling
                if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    other += skip_bd
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust for business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By properly handling holidays and business days within the adjustment logic, the corrected `apply` function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values while addressing the GitHub issue related to date range behavior with custom holidays.
