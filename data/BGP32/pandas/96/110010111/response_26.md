## Analysis
The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function `apply` is used to adjust a given datetime value based on custom business hour offsets.

The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation while running the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays. The error states that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the provided frequency, specifically related to the holiday being added.

The expected input/output values provided for multiple test cases help understand the correct behavior of the function and potential issues with the current implementation.

## Bugs Identified
1. The function is not properly handling the scenario when adjusting for holidays. This leads to an incorrect calculation and subsequent `ValueError` during frequency validation.
2. The function does not appropriately adjust for holidays while considering the custom business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and adhere to the expected values:
1. Ensure correct handling of holidays during the adjustment process.
2. Implement correct logic for adjusting the datetime value while considering custom business hours and holidays.
3. Validate the frequency without raising the error related to the inferred frequency and the custom business hours' definition.

## Bug Fixes and Updated Function
The corrected function should properly adjust the given datetime value considering the custom business hours and holidays. Here is the updated version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, Timedelta
from datetime import datetime


@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), (7200 // 60))
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - Timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        t_offset = self._offset_daily_offset
        if n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other - 1, t_offset)
        else:
            other = self._get_opening_time(other, t_offset)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should properly adjust the datetime values and handle holidays while considering the defined custom business hours. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the expected input/output values are met for all test cases.
