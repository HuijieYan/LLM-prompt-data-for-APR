### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring during a frequency validation check inside the `_validate_frequency` method related to frequencies not conforming between inferred and passed values.
3. The function `apply` is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours but seems to have an issue with handling the holiday parameter correctly.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring the correct handling of holidays in the adjustments made for business hours.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function `apply` that addresses the holiday handling issue.

### Bug Fix:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0)
        
        # adjust based on holiday
        if self._is_holiday(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # adjust other to the next working business hour
        end_of_business = self._adjust_to_end_of_business(other)
        if n >= 0 and other >= end_of_business:
            # move to the next working business hour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # remaining business hours calculation
        business_hours_sec = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 3600), business_hours_sec // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # perform adjustments based on business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self._adjust_business_days(bd, other)
            other = self._next_business_hour(other) if skip_bd else other

        # remaining business hours adjustment
        other = self._adjust_remaining_hours(other, n, r, nanosecond)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- The adjustment of `other` to reduce cases is simplified.
- Handling holidays has been separated out to ensure adjustments are made correctly.
- Conditions for moving to next working business hours are addressed appropriately.
- Business day adjustments are better handled, avoiding issues with the previous logic.
- Remaining business hours are adjusted correctly based on the calculated values.

By applying these adjustments, the corrected function should address the issue related to holiday handling during adjustments based on business hours.
