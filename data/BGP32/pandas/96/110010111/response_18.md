### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
2. The function is supposed to apply business hour offsets to datetime objects.
3. The error message is `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`.
4. The expected input values are specific `datetime`, `int`, `tuple`, and `CustomBusinessHour` objects.
5. The issue is related to custom business hours with holidays causing incorrect handling of business hour frequencies.

### Bug Description
1. The bug occurs due to improper handling of business hours and holidays within the `apply` function.
2. The function expects a valid `DateOffset` for frequency validation, but the custom business hour object is not properly evaluated with the holidays.
3. This causes the function to raise a `ValueError` because the inferred frequency does not match the custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles frequency validation with holidays included in custom business hours.
2. Make necessary adjustments to the logic for applying business hours and handling holidays to align the frequencies properly.
3. Ensure that business hour adjustment accounts for the presence of holidays and maintains the correct frequency.
