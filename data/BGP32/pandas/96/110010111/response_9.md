### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function contains a datetime manipulation to adjust the input datetime based on business hours.
3. The bug is triggered due to incorrect adjustments leading to unexpected behavior in the output. The error message suggests that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the given frequency `CBH`. This causes the function to raise a `ValueError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly adjust the input datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour offsets to ensure the output datetime aligns with the business hours.
5. I will correct the function based on the expected variable values and types provided.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
        )
        
        # Adjust the input datetime based on CustomBusinessHour
        if n >= 0:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic based on the provided expected values, the corrected function should now align the output datetime correctly with the CustomBusinessHour offsets.
