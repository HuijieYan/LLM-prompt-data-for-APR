### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which subclasses `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is designed to apply the custom business hour offset to a given datetime.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during frequency validation.
4. The function is failing to correctly handle the number of periods and holidays when creating a `DatetimeIndex` using `pd.date_range`.
5. The issue reported on GitHub describes a situation where adding holidays can lead to unexpected behavior with the `periods` parameter in `pd.date_range`.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to how the function calculates the next business hour considering holidays and the number of periods. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic in the function that handles the adjustment for holidays and the number of periods.
2. Make sure that the function correctly accounts for the impact of holidays on the total number of periods generated.

### Corrected Code: 
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should address the issue:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        freq = self
        inferred = None
            
        if hasattr(other, 'freq'):
            index = other
            inferred = index.inferred_freq
    
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nano=0)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other + skip_bd):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for handling holidays and the number of periods, this version of the `apply` function should now create `DatetimeIndex` correctly when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
