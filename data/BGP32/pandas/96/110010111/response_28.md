### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on a business hour offset. It handles cases where `n` is positive or negative, adjusts for business days, and calculates remaining business hours.
2. The buggy function is causing a `ValueError` due to a failed array comparison within `_validate_frequency`, which checks if the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect behavior in calculating the business hours and adjusting the datetime, leading to mismatched frequencies and triggering the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the adjustments made to the datetime within the `apply` function align with the expected behavior for business hour offsets.
5. The corrected function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            other = as_datetime(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            if n >= 0:
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the ValueError issue and align the adjustments made during the `apply` function with the expected behavior for business hour offsets.
