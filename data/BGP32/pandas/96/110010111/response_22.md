### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The bug is related to the validation of frequency in the `CustomBusinessHour` class that causes issues when working with the `date_range` function and adding holidays.
3. The code should adjust the given timestamp based on business hours, days, and holidays, but it fails due to an issue related to the inferred frequency and validation of the custom business hour.
4. To fix the bug, the validation of frequencies needs to be updated to handle periods properly when combined with holidays in the `date_range` function.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of frequencies and holidays when generating a `DateTimeIndex` using the `date_range` function. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, causing a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the validation logic for frequencies to properly handle the presence of holidays in the `date_range` function.
2. Update the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class per the expected input/output values and the identified error cause.
3. Ensure that the adjusted timestamps align with the business hours and holidays when generating the date range.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to include only date and time components
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # Adjust other to align with business hours and days
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Calculate adjustment by business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Calculate remaining business hours for adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust remaining business hours based on direction (forward/backward)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the `apply` method as described above, the bug related to the incorrect validation of frequencies with holidays should be resolved, and the corrected function should align with the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
