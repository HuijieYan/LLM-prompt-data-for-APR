### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The error message reveals a `ValueError` being raised during the frequency validation process, specifically when comparing `freq.freqstr` with the inferred frequency.
- The function is intended to calculate the adjusted datetime based on a given datetime with business hours, adjusting for holidays and business days.
- The expected inputs include a `Timestamp` object, various other attributes in the `self` object, and parameters for calculating the adjusted datetime.
- The key issue arises when handling cases where holidays are involved, leading to unexpected periods in the output.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct handling of business hours, holidays, and business days in the context of the given datetime object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper conversion of input `Timestamp` object to `datetime` format.
2. Verify the adjustment logic when dealing with positive and negative values of `n`.
3. Enhance the handling of holidays to prevent any discrepancies in the adjusted datetime.
4. Check the adjustment by business days before proceeding with the adjustment for remaining business hours.
5. Make necessary adjustments to ensure that the correct datetime is returned based on the business-hour logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain < bhour
                        or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By addressing the adjustments based on holidays and business days, along with the correct business hours logic, the corrected function should now handle the calculations properly without causing erroneous periods in the output.
