### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust datetime objects based on business hour offsets. 
2. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency related to a DateTimeIndex object, specifically, the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency ('CBH').
3. The GitHub issue relates to `pd.date_range` not functioning correctly when using periods and adding holidays. The issue points out unexpected behavior when adding holidays results in more than the specified number of periods.
4. The bug potentially stems from the logic within the `apply` function not properly handling the adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours, leading to unexpected results.
5. The correction involves ensuring that the adjustment logic for business hours and holiday handling aligns with the expected behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the adjustment and calculation logic for business hours within the `apply` function.
2. Confirm that adjustments based on holidays are correctly accounted for within the function.
3. Ensure that the interaction between business offsets, holidays, and periods is accurately handled to prevent unexpected results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    # Fixed and corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjusting datetime based on business hour offsets
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Adjusting datetime based on business days
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            # Adjusting remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    break
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correctly adjusting the datetime objects based on the business hour offsets and ensuring holiday handling aligns with the expected behavior, the corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
