### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a method used for applying business hour offsets to datetime objects. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during a call to `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays.

The error message specifically mentions that the inferred frequency is `None` from passed values, which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This is leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

The provided GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where `periods` with holidays result in unexpected output. The issue showcases an example where the number of periods surpasses the expected value due to the usage of holidays.

### Identified Bug:
The issue stems from the fact that the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling holidays correctly. The logic in the method does not consider holidays when adjusting the business hours around a given datetime object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `apply` method to properly handle holidays when adjusting the business hours. This involves checking if a given datetime falls on a holiday and making adjustments accordingly to ensure the correct number of business hours are accounted for.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method that includes handling holidays:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessHour

def is_holiday(dt, holidays):
    return dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') in holidays

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # Existing code omitted for brevity

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if holidays and is_holiday(other, holidays):
                return other  # Skip adjusting on holidays

            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjusting logic with holidays included
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or is_holiday(other, holidays):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or is_holiday(other, holidays):
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not (self._is_on_offset(other) or is_holiday(other, holidays)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Remaining implementation logic...
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we added a `holidays` parameter to the `apply` method to pass in the list of holidays. Then, we added a check if the current datetime falls on a holiday within the adjustments in the method.

This fix should address the issue related to applying business hour offsets with holidays correctly.
