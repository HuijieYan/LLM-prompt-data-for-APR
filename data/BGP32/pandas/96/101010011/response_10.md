### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError occurring during frequency validation for a DatetimeArray.
3. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problem when using `date_range` with periods and holidays. It produces more than the expected number of periods.
4. The issue seems related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays not behaving as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how the offset is applied when adjusting the datetime based on business hours with the presence of holidays. It results in an incorrect number of periods when generating the date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are considered when adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The logic for adjusting the datetime may need to account for holidays to calculate the correct periods.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
                other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n

            # adjust datetime based on holidays and business hours
            other = self.rollout(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we rely on a `rollout` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class to handle the adjustment of the datetime in consideration of holidays and business hours. This approach aims to ensure that the correct number of periods are generated when applying the offset.
