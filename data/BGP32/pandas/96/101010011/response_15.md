### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is attempting to correctly adjust datetime based on business hours and days, but it fails due to a logic error leading to unexpected behavior in generating datetime indexes.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between inferred and passed frequencies, causing a `ValueError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a specific case where adding holidays results in more periods being generated than expected, suggesting the bug lies in the handling of holidays.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic around holiday handling in the `apply` function to ensure that the correct number of business days and hours are calculated while considering holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic around holiday handling within the `apply` function to consider adjusting the datetime index based on the holiday schedule correctly.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and hours align with the intended behavior when holidays are included.
3. Verify that the frequency handling is consistent with the expected behavior when holidays are applied.
4. Test the corrected function with the provided failing test case to ensure that the datetime index is generated correctly without extra periods due to holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            is_holiday = other.date() in self.holidays  # Check if the date is a holiday
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or is_holiday:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or is_holiday:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or is_holiday:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Remaining logic remains unchanged
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the holiday check in the adjustment logic, the corrected function should handle the holiday scenarios correctly and generate the datetime index as expected, resolving the issue reported and passing the failing test case.
