### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
2. The issue reported on GitHub focuses on `pd.date_range` not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays.
3. The bug is likely related to how the custom business hour frequency is handled with holidays and periods, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated.
4. The current implementation of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `apply` function is used to adjust a datetime value based on a custom business hour frequency.
2. The bug arises from incorrectly handling periods and holidays in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in certain cases.
3. The incorrect adjustment of dates within the function is causing the `ValueError` during frequency validation in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle periods and holidays when adjusting datetime values.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of dates aligns with the expected behavior of a custom business hour frequency.
3. Carefully handle the cases where holidays impact the resulting periods to avoid errors during frequency validation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Fixed version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_hour = self.start[0].hour
            end_hour = self.end[-1].hour
            
            business_hours = (end_hour - start_hour) + 1

            prev_open = other

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    prev_open = self._next_opening_time(prev_open)
                    if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
                        n -= 1

                while n < 0:
                    prev_open -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
                        n += 1

                return prev_open

            else:
                while n < 0:
                    prev_open -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
                        n += 1

                while n > 0:
                    prev_open = self._next_opening_time(prev_open)
                    if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
                        n -= 1

                return prev_open
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Outcome:
The corrected `apply` function should address the issue of incorrect periods being generated when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. By properly adjusting the datetime values based on the custom business hour frequency, the function should produce the intended results without errors.
