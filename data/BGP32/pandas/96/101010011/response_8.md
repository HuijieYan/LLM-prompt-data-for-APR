### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. When adjusting the timestamp based on business hours and holidays, the function generates more periods than expected, leading to unexpected behavior in date_range function.
The error occurs because the calculation of business hours is not precise and does not handle holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect adjustment of the timestamp.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not accurately adjust the timestamp based on business hours and holidays. As a result, the number of periods generated exceeds the expected value, causing the date_range function to behave unexpectedly. The buggy function does not handle holidays properly, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to accurately calculate the number of business hours and handle holidays correctly.
2. Make sure the adjustment of timestamps considers holidays and accurately reflects the number of business hours.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
   
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            start_time = other
            n = self.n
            businessdays = 0
            holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])

            while n != 0:
                # Calculate the adjusted time after considering the business hours
                adjusted_time = self.business_hour_adjustment(start_time)
                
                # Check if adjusted time is on a holiday
                if adjusted_time in holidays:
                    adjusted_time = self.next_bday(adjusted_time) # Move to the next business day
                    continue
                
                start_time = adjusted_time
                n -= 1
                businessdays += 1

            return start_time  # Return the adjusted time

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
    def business_hour_adjustment(self, start_time):
        adjusted_time = start_time
        bhours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        minutes_in_hour = 60
        total_minutes = abs(self.n) * minutes_in_hour
        sign = 1 if self.n >= 0 else -1

        while total_minutes > 0:
            # Check if adjusted time falls within business hours
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time, sign)
            next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time, sign)
            time_delta = next_open_time - adjusted_time
            minutes_increment = min(time_delta.total_seconds() / 60, total_minutes)
            adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=minutes_increment)
            total_minutes -= minutes_increment
        
        return adjusted_time
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `apply` function now accurately adjusts the timestamp based on business hours, considering holidays during the adjustment process.
2. The `business_hour_adjustment` function handles the precise calculation of the adjusted time based on business hours.
3. Holidays are properly checked and accounted for during the timestamp adjustments.

This corrected code should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect behavior with `date_range` when holidays are included.
