### Analysis:
1. The bug originates from the incorrect handling of business hours when an offset is applied with a `periods` argument in the `pd.date_range` function, leading to irregular results.
2. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency doesn't conform to the passed frequency due to the absence of proper handling within the `apply` method in the `apply_wraps` decorator.
3. The buggy function does not handle the adjustments related to holidays properly, causing the generated dates to exceed the expected number of periods.
4. To fix the bug, modifications are required in the logic of adjusting dates when holidays are involved within business hours offsets.
5. The corrected version below addresses the bug by making adjustments to account for holidays properly.

### Correction:
```python
# The buggy function corrected
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_other = other

            # adjust other to business hours considering possible holidays
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(original_other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(original_other)
                    if original_other.time() in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                    while self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                # skip holidays within business hours
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

                if n > 0:
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the adjustment logic based on holidays within business hours offsets, the corrected `apply` function will now correctly handle the application of offsets within the given business hours, ensuring that the dates generated by `pd.date_range` align with the expected number of periods, as requested in the GitHub issue.
