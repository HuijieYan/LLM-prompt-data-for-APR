### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error arises when using the Pandas `date_range` function with periods and a custom business hour frequency including holidays.
3. The bug results in the `date_range` generating more periods than expected, causing a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.
4. One potential cause of the bug is in the `apply` method's logic for adjusting business hours and handling holidays.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment for holidays and business hours within the `apply` method is handled correctly to align with the expected behavior of the `date_range` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to handling holidays in the `apply` method to ensure that the holiday dates are correctly considered while calculating business hours.
2. Verify how the adjusted `apply` method interacts with the `date_range` function to generate the correct number of periods based on the specified custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, "nanosecond"):
            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), other.time())
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the logic in the `apply` method, the adjusted function should now handle holidays and business hours appropriately, ensuring that the `date_range` function behaves as expected.
