### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply()` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a problem when trying to generate a date range using custom business hours and holidays in pandas.
3. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where adding holidays to the custom business frequency results in more than the expected number of periods in the date range.
4. The bug seems to be related to calculating the business hours correctly while considering holidays.
5. The bug might be in how adjustments for the holidays are handled within the `apply()` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply()` function when generating date ranges with custom business hours.
- The bug fails to adjust the date range correctly when holidays are introduced, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resultant DatetimeIndex.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic related to adjusting for holidays in the `apply()` function to ensure correct handling and alignment with business hours.
- Check the adjustments made for holidays and their impact on the resulting dates in the date range generation process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Same code as before
        
        # adjust other for holidays
        holiday_adjusted = False
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            if other.date().isoformat() in self.holidays:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                holiday_adjusted = True
        
        if not holiday_adjusted:
            if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start and self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Remaining code for business hour calculations remains the same
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This modified `apply()` function now includes adjustments for holidays, ensuring that the dates within the date range are correctly aligned with custom business hours even in the presence of holidays.
