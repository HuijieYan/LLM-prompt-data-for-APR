### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The error arises when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, causing more periods to be generated than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency `CBH`.
4. The `apply` function is manipulating the datetime objects and adjusting them based on business hours, leading to incorrect results when adjusting for holidays and periods.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made to properly handle holidays and periods within the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function correctly consider holidays and handle adjusting periods.
2. Modify the code related to handling holidays to prevent the generation of additional periods when holidays are present.
3. Consider the `on_freq` calculation and the comparison with `index` to correct the frequency issue.

### Bug-fixed code:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Adjust time to 00:00 if start time
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # Handle holidays
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        return other
```

By making adjustments to handle holidays and periods correctly within the `apply` function, the bug should be fixed, ensuring that the `pd.date_range` behavior aligns with expectations.
