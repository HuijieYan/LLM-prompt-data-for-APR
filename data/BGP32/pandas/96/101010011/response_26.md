### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to the frequency validation when using custom business hours with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
- The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where using periods in `pd.date_range` with holidays results in unexpected output.
- The problem lies in the `apply` function, where adjustments to the business hours and holidays are not managed correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when generating ranges.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The handling of holidays in the `apply` function is incomplete, leading to irregular behavior.
2. Adjustments related to business hours in the presence of holidays are not appropriately managed, causing the issue observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly adjust the business hours and holidays when generating date ranges, leading to incorrect frequencies. The inaccurate handling of holidays and adjustments results in the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test and reported GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the holiday handling within the function to correctly skip holidays when adjusting date ranges.
2. Ensure that adjustments to business hours account for holidays to generate accurate frequency results.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if self.start <= other.time() < self.end:
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other, next_opening):
                return next_opening

        if other.time() < self.start:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            return self._get_closing_time(other)

        raise ApplyTypeError("Invalid holiday or business hour")

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the function to handle holidays and business hours correctly, the corrected version should address the issue observed in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
