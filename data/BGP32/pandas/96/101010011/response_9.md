### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is used in custom business hour calculations.
2. The error message is raised during the validation of frequency in the `pd.date_range` function, specifically when using periods and adding holidays.
3. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency (`CBH`), causing a `ValueError`.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the `date_range` function behaves unexpectedly when using periods and holidays together.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class causes the invalid inference of frequency in the `pd.date_range` function. This leads to a mismatch between the inferred frequency (`None`) and the passed frequency (`CBH`). As a result, a `ValueError` is raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub:
1. Ensure that the frequency handling in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class harmonizes with the expected behavior of custom business hours, periods, and holidays.
2. Make necessary adjustments to the frequency calculation logic to correctly determine the frequency for the given business hour parameters.
3. Correctly handle the conversion of datetime objects to avoid any discrepancies that may lead to frequency inference issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if abs(n) >= businesshours / 60 and n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # adjust business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # adjust business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        end_dt = other

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections in the `apply` function as shown above, the inference of frequencies and calculations related to custom business hours should behave correctly, resolving the reported issue.
