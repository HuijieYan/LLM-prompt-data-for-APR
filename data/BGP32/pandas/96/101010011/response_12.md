### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The error is related to the incorrect returning of datetime objects.
3. The bug causes the `date_range` function to yield more periods than expected, leading to misalignments.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function should be corrected to handle business days and hours properly.
5. Please find the corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Assume the necessary imports are present

from datetime import timedelta

# Remaining portions unchanged for conciseness

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday(other):
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other += skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the adjustment handling for business days, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
