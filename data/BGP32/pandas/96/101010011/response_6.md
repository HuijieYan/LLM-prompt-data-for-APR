### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the offsets.py file of pandas.
- The function is throwing an `ApplyTypeError` instead of a `ValueError`.
- The error message points towards the frequency validation error during the creation of the DatetimeIndex.
- The related function `_validate_frequency` in datetimes.py is where the error occurs, specifically when trying to validate the frequency compatibility.
- The GitHub issue relates to `pd.date_range` not functioning correctly when using periods and adding holidays, leading to more periods than expected.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from an invalid frequency when creating the DatetimeIndex due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, causing a ValueError.
- The issue stems from the apply function not correctly handling holiday dates in conjunction with frequencies, leading to unexpected results in the DatetimeIndex generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the apply function to correctly handle holiday dates while setting the frequencies, ensuring the alignment between inferred and passed frequencies.
- Use a more appropriate exception type, such as `ValueError`, to align with the actual issue rather than `ApplyTypeError`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
# Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the code as per the provided correction, the function should now handle holiday dates correctly and align the frequencies, resolving the issue seen in the failing test associated with the GitHub problem.
