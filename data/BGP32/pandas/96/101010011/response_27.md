### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and providing a holiday.
3. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problematic scenario where adding holidays can lead to incorrect periods being generated by `pd.date_range`.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the custom business hour frequency handles holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the `apply` function processes holidays within the custom business hour frequency. When adjusting the timestamp to account for a holiday, the logic may not correctly handle the holiday case, leading to an incorrect adjustment.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are appropriately considered when calculating the adjusted timestamp. The function should correctly identify holidays and adjust the timestamp accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Existing code

            # Check for holidays and adjust timestamp accordingly
            if other in self.holidays:
                # Move to next opening time if holiday
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Existing code

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding a check for holidays in the `apply` function, we can ensure that holidays are properly handled during the timestamp adjustment. This change should address the issue with unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays in `pd.date_range`.
