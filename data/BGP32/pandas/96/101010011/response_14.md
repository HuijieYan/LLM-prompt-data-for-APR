### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is being used within the context of date range validation where a frequency mismatch is causing the error.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring during frequency validation.
3. The issue posted on GitHub is related to the misbehavior of `date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, leading to unexpected output.
4. The bug seems to stem from improper application of business hour offsets in the context of date range validation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to a frequency mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency settings when handling holidays. The business hour adjustments within the `apply` function are not aligning properly, leading to incorrect date outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function align correctly with the business hour constraints.
2. Modify the logic related to business hours and adjustments to handle holidays and period frequencies properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day,
                other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version that ensures proper alignment of time adjustments within the business hour constraints, the issue related to the unexpected behavior in `date_range` with periods and holidays should be resolved.
