### Identification of the Bug
The bug occurs in the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It seems to be related to how the adjustment is done for business hours when holidays are considered.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes an issue when adjusting the datetime based on business hours with holidays. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the specified frequency when applying holidays. This leads to extra periods being generated in the resulting DatetimeIndex.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made within the `apply` method to ensure that the adjustments for holidays are properly handled without causing the extra periods.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Method

```python
# Corrected version of the `apply` method
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_other = other

        if n >= 0:
            while adjusted_other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other) or adjusted_other in self.holidays:
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
        else:
            while adjusted_other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other) or adjusted_other in self.holidays:
                adjusted_other = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)
        
        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

In this corrected version:
- Instead of adjusting `other` based on the initial logic, we continuously adjust it until it aligns with the business hour boundaries and is not a holiday.
- This way, holidays are taken into consideration during the adjustment process, ensuring that the resulting datetime is valid.

By making these adjustments, we should be able to fix the issue related to the inferred frequency mismatch and the extra periods in the resulting DatetimeIndex.
