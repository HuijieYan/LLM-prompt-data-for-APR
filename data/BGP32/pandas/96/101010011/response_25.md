### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the `ValueError` when `pd.date_range` is used with custom business hours and holidays.
2. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.
3. The related GitHub issue highlights the problem when using `periods` in `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays, leading to an unexpected number of periods due to incorrect handling of holidays in the business hours calculation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation within the `apply` function considers holidays correctly when adjusting the business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `apply` function to account for holidays when adjusting business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the business hours excluding holidays.
3. Handle cases where adjustments cross into holidays appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            # Skip holidays for adjustment
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if n < 0:
                n -= 1  # Adjust for the current day being counted
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0]) // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle adjusting business hours correctly, accounting for holidays while aligning with the specified custom business hours.
