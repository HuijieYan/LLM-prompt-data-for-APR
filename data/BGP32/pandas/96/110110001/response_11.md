### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The test function that fails is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation, specifically mentioning that "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH."
4. The bug seems to be related to the frequency validation within the `DatetimeIndex` generation that is caused by the incorrect behavior of the `apply` function.
5. The bug needs to be fixed by adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to correctly process the datetime values based on business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `apply` function to return incorrect datetime values in certain cases, leading to a failure in frequency validation when generating a `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `apply` function to properly adjust datetime values based on business hours, ensuring that the frequency validation passes when creating the `DatetimeIndex` object.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, with the corrected `apply` function, the frequency validation error should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
