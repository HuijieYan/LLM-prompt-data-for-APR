### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing an error in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` due to incorrect handling of business hours and datetime objects. The error message indicates a frequency validation issue related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with the DateTimeIndex.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting business hours and datetime objects, leading to an incorrect frequency validation in the test case. The error message specifically points to a mismatch in inferred frequency and the passed frequency (CBH for CustomBusinessHour).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of business hours and datetime objects in the `apply` function is correct.
2. Address any issues related to adding/subtracting business days and remaining business hours.
3. Verify that the adjusted datetime object matches the expected frequency to pass the test case.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Reimplemented the adjustment logic for `n` number of business hours to ensure correct offset calculation.
2. Changed the adjustment process to increment or decrement the datetime object by 1 hour until the desired business hours adjustment is achieved.
3. Updated the return statement to reflect the corrected datetime object based on the adjusted business hours.

By implementing these changes to the `apply` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case successfully.
