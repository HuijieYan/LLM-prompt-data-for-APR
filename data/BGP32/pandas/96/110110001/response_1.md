### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in pandas/tseries/offsets.py file. This function is used to apply the business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of creating a date range with custom business hours. The test is using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with specific start time and holidays.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency against the passed values. It specifically mentions that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.
4. The bug could be related to how the `apply` function handles adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object within the `apply` function. The error suggests that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, indicating an issue with how the adjustments are being made.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object by the `apply` function align properly with the business hour offset. Adjustments based on positive or negative business hours need to be handled correctly to avoid inconsistencies that lead to failing the frequency validation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n == 0:
                return other

            original_other = other
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)

            business_start_hour = min(self.start.hour, self.end.hour)
            business_end_hour = max(self.start.hour, self.end.hour)

            start_date = date(other.year, other.month, other.day) + timedelta(days=1)
            start_time = datetime.combine(start_date, datetime.min.time())
            business_start_time = start_time.replace(hour=business_start_hour)
            business_end_time = start_time.replace(hour=business_end_hour)

            if self.n > 0:
                while self.n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other >= business_end_time:
                        self.n -= 1
            else:
                while self.n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    if other < business_start_time:
                        self.n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function takes into account the adjustment of the datetime object based on the positive or negative business hours. It ensures that the datetime object aligns properly with the business hour offset, addressing the issue causing the failing frequency validation in the test.
