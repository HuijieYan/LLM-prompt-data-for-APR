### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, designated for business hour calculations.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the creation of a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency, specifically due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
4. The bug seems to stem from how the business hours are calculated and adjusted within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect adjustments and causing the frequency validation failure.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours within the `apply` function are correctly computed and applied to the datetime object.

### Bug Fix:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
    
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # Adjust other based on n value
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

``` 

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and pass the failing test scenario. It ensures correct adjustments for business days and business hours, leading to accurate datetime calculations with custom business hours.
