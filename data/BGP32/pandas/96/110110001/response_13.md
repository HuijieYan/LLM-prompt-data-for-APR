### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is used to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of custom business hours with holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised in the `_validate_frequency` method when validating the frequency of the index.
4. The bug seems to be related to how business hours are handled within the `apply` function, which impacts the frequency validation.
5. The bug likely arises from incorrect adjustments to the business hours and time intervals in the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments to the given datetime object within the `apply` function are correctly calculated to respect business hours and intervals.
2. Make sure that the adjustments account for negative business hour values as well.
3. Update the function to correctly adjust the datetime object based on business hours and return the adjusted datetime object.
4. Verify that the corrected function passes the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(n))

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time())
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += timedelta(seconds=bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=(bhour // 60))
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self._get_closing_time(other).time())
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=(bhour // 60))
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    else:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version focuses on correctly adjusting the business hours and intervals of the given datetime object based on the provided business hour offset. It should address the bug and pass the failing test.
