### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The function is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours with holidays.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation not conforming to the expected frequency.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug seems to stem from the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, specifically related to the handling of business days, business hours, and adjusting the datetime accordingly.
- The error is likely due to incorrect adjustments leading to the frequency mismatch observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the current implementation is likely due to incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days. This causes a mismatch in the expected frequencies when generating the datetime index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic inside the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours and business days.
- Ensure that the adjustments are made accurately to match the expected frequencies when generating the result datetime index.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = opening_time
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = np.busday_offset(other, bd, roll='forward')
            other = skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        for _ in range(len(self.start)):
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
            else:
                closing_time = self._next_opening_time(opening_time)
            
            bhour = closing_time - opening_time

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                opening_time = closing_time

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `apply` function adjusts the datetime object based on business hours and business days accurately.
- By properly handling the adjustments, the corrected version should now pass the failing test related to custom business hours and holidays.
