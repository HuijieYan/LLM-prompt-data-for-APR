### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation, suggesting that the custom business hours frequency does not conform to the expected frequency.

### Potential Error Location:
- The bug is likely related to the handling of custom business hours and the frequency of the date range generation in the `apply` function.
- The error may stem from incorrect adjustments applied to the `other` datetime object within the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug causes the custom business hours frequency to not conform to the expected frequency, leading to a ValueError during frequency validation.
- This issue arises from incorrect manipulation of the datetime object (`other`) within the `apply` function, which impacts the calculation of business hours and adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correct the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object to ensure it aligns with the custom business hours and frequency requirements.
- Make adjustments to handle custom business hours and date range generation accurately.
- Ensure that the resulting datetime object adheres to the custom business hours frequency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            hours, remainder = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                hours, remainder = -hours, -remainder

            if hours != 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=hours)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remainder_time = other - prev_opening
                    other = prev_opening + business_day_offset + remainder_time
                else:
                    other = other + business_day_offset

            remainder_hours = timedelta(minutes=remainder)

            while remainder_hours != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    business_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if business_hour > remainder_hours:
                        other += remainder_hours
                        remainder_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remainder_hours -= business_hour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour)
                else:
                    business_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if business_hour < remainder_hours:
                        other += remainder_hours
                        remainder_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remainder_hours -= business_hour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
- The bug in the `apply` function has been fixed by adjusting the logic for handling custom business hours and date range generation.
- The corrected version ensures that the `other` datetime object aligns with the custom business hours frequency requirements, resolving the ValueError during frequency validation in the failing test.
