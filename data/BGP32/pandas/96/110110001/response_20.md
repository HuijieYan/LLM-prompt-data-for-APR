### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class that is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is attempting to create a custom business hour frequency, but it fails due to a ValueError related to frequency validation.
- The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely in the logic of adjusting the datetime object based on business hours within the `apply` method.
- The issue seems to be related to how the adjustment is made, leading to an incorrect frequency being inferred.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `apply` method is causing the adjustment of the datetime object to result in an inferred frequency that does not conform to the custom business hour frequency specified in the test.
- This discrepancy in frequencies is causing the ValueError during the validation process in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` method needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that the frequency of the adjusted datetime object matches the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic inside the `apply` method to adjust the datetime object based on business hours without causing a frequency inconsistency.

Please try this corrected version to see if it resolves the issue in the failing test.
