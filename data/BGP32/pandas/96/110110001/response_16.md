### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a mixin class inherited by `BusinessMixin`.
2. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing due to a validation error related to frequency conformance.
3. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).
4. The bug likely originates from the logic within the `apply` function that handles business days, business hours, and adjustments to datetime based on the specified business hours.
5. A strategy for fixing this bug would involve reviewing the logic related to adjusting business days and hours to ensure it aligns with the provided frequency and handles the edge conditions properly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    new_bhour_remain = self._adjust_business_hours_forward(bhour_remain, other)
                    if new_bhour_remain == bhour_remain:
                        break  # No further adjustments needed
                    bhour_remain = new_bhour_remain
                else:
                    new_bhour_remain = self._adjust_business_hours_backward(bhour_remain, other, nanosecond)
                    if new_bhour_remain == bhour_remain:
                        break  # No further adjustments needed
                    bhour_remain = new_bhour_remain
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the frequency conformance issue and pass the failing test.
