### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours, which is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `DateTimeIndex` generation with the custom business hours offset.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the `apply` function not handling custom business hours correctly, leading to the incorrect inference of frequency which causes the error during index generation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `apply` function correctly adjusts the datetime object based on the business hours.
2. Update the logic to handle custom business hours properly to avoid frequency inference issues.
3. Debug and verify the adjustments made by the function for different cases to ensure correct results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            other = other + timedelta(seconds=60) if n > 0 else other - timedelta(seconds=60)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                n -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment logic based on the direction of adjustment (positive or negative) and correctly handles the business hour intervals.

### Result:
After applying this corrected version, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without raising any `ValueError` related to frequency inference.
