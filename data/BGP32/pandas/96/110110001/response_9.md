### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to handle adjustments to a given datetime based on business hours.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is using a `CustomBusinessHour` offset with specific start time and holidays, but the adjusted dates are not as expected.
4. The error message indicates a `ValueError` due to a frequency mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment and calculation of business hours in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments and a frequency mismatch error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for business hours needs to be corrected to ensure the accurate adjustment of given datetimes while respecting the business hours constraints.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._get_closing_time(self._get_prev_opening_time(other)).time() in self.start:
                    prev_open = self._get_prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._get_prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, the corrected version should now accurately adjust datetimes based on business hours, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
