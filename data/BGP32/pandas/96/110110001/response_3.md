## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to the frequency validation when generating the expected `DatetimeIndex`.

## Potential Error Location
The error seems to be originating from the calculations and adjustments made within the `apply` function, which is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hour offsets.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing incorrect adjustments to datetime objects based on business hour offsets, leading to an incorrect result when generating the expected `DatetimeIndex`. This results in a frequency validation failure, causing the test to fail with a `ValueError`.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object based on business hour offsets are correct and accurately account for the business hour intervals.
2. Verify the logic for handling positive and negative business hour values and adjust the datetime object accordingly.
3. Check the calculations for determining business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments and calculations more accurate in the corrected version of the `apply` function, the test should pass successfully without raising any `ValueError` related to frequency validation issues.
