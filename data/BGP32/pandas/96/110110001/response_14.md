### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the class.
2. The error occurs in a test related to custom business hours where the computed date range does not match the expected date range.
3. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, causing a `ValueError`.
4. The buggy function logic for adjusting business hours seems to be incorrect or incomplete, leading to the discrepancy between inferred and passed frequencies.
5. To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic of the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime according to the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the datetime is adjusted properly based on the specified business hours.
2. Take care when handling negative business hours (moving to previous business day).
3. Check the generation of business hours within the specified start and end times.
4. Make sure that the adjustment of business hours is accurate and avoids discrepancies in frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            while n != 0:
                day_adjust = n // abs(n)
                other += timedelta(days=day_adjust)
                n -= day_adjust

                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                elif other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours logic provided, the corrected version should now correctly handle the adjustment of business hours and pass the failing test.
