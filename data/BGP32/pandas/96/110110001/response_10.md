### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to custom business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours.
- The error occurs during frequency validation while creating a `DatetimeIndex` with custom business hours.

### Potential Error Locations:
- In the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
- Calculation of total business hours.
- Handling of negative business hour cases.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes the custom business hours to not be applied correctly, leading to incorrect date-time index generation.
- The logic for adjusting business days and business hours does not handle the custom business hour offset properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Review and modify the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
- Ensure that the custom business hour offset is correctly applied during date-time index generation.
- Check and update the calculation of total business hours to consider custom offsets.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
            other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling business days and business hours to correctly apply custom business hours.
