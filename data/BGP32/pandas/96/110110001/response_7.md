### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The `apply` function is supposed to apply custom business hour logic to a given datetime value.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of custom business hours with holidays included in the frequency.
4. The error message indicates a problem with validating the frequency related to the custom business hour offset.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of custom business hours and adjusting datetime values based on the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic related to custom business hours and ensure that the adjustments to the datetime values are handled correctly based on the business hours.
2. Verify the validation of frequencies and ensure that the changes in the datetime values due to the custom business hours align with the expected frequency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return as_datetime(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, with the corrected function logic, it should handle the adjustments to datetime values based on custom business hours correctly, potentially resolving the frequency validation issue observed in the failing test.
