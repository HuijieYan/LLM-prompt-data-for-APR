### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation not conforming.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly adjusting the dates with custom business hours leading to a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle the custom business hours for the provided dates.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
        
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
            remaining_hours = n % 24
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
            business_days = n // 24
            if business_days != 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                for _ in range(abs(business_days-1)):
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            
            remaining_time = timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
        
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_time > timedelta(0):
                    open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    time_diff = open_time - other
                    
                    if time_diff <= remaining_time:
                        other = open_time
                        remaining_time -= time_diff
                    else:
                        other += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
            
            else:
                while remaining_time < timedelta(0):
                    close_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    time_diff = other - close_time
                    
                    if time_diff <= abs(remaining_time):
                        other = close_time
                        remaining_time += time_diff
                    else:
                        other += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic within the `apply` function as shown above, the bug should be addressed and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
