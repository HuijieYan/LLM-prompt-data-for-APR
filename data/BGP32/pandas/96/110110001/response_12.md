### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. This function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to datetime objects.
3. The failing test is related to custom business hours and holidays.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is related to the adjustment of business days and business hours. The incorrect adjustment logic leads to a discrepancy between the expected and actual frequencies when creating a DatetimeIndex with custom business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and business hours in the `apply` function:
1. Ensure correct handling of positive and negative offsets.
2. Properly adjust business days before adjusting business hours.
3. Adjust business hours within the same business day interval.
4. Adjust business hours when transitioning to the next business day interval.
5. Return the correctly adjusted datetime object.

### Fixed Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n >= 0:
                # Adjust for positive offsets
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Adjust for negative offsets
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)  # Move to previous business day
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)  # Remaining business hours

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected adjustments in the `apply` function, the DatetimeIndex generation with custom business hours should work correctly without the frequency mismatch error.
