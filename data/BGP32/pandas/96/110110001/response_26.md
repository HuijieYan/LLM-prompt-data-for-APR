### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is used to adjust the given datetime based on business hours specified by the mixin class.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of custom business hours, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.
4. The error seems to be related to how the frequency is being validated within the `pd.DatetimeIndex` creation where the inferred frequency doesn't conform to the passed frequency.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime values, leading to mismatches in inferred and passed frequencies when creating a `pd.DatetimeIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime values are correct based on the business hours specified.
2. Validate the frequency properly to avoid the mismatch error when creating a `pd.DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 1440)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_open - other
                    if r >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other = next_open
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = other - prev_open
                    if abs(r) >= abs(bhour.total_seconds() // 60):
                        other = prev_open
                        r += bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the calculations of business days and remaining business hours, the corrected version of the function should now properly adjust the datetime values based on the specified business hours.
