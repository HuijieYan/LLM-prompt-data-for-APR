### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the class. However, the function contains logic errors that result in unexpected behavior.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of custom business hours, which involves creating a date range using a custom business hour frequency.
- The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency when creating the expected `DatetimeIndex`.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of `other` variable in different scenarios based on the sign of `n`.
2. Incorrect handling of business days and remaining business hours.
3. Potential logic errors in adjusting the `other` datetime object within the while loops.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function fails to correctly handle the adjustments to the given datetime object `other` based on the business hours, leading to inconsistencies in adjusting the dates and times.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Ensure that the adjustments to the `other` datetime object are consistent and accurate depending on the business hours specified.
2. Revise the logic for handling business days and remaining business hours to ensure correct adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            n = self.n
            is_positive = n >= 0

            # adjust `other` based on business hours
            if is_positive:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                   other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                   other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate business days, business hours and adjust `other`
            days_adjustment, business_remain = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if not is_positive:
                days_adjustment = -days_adjustment
                business_remain = -business_remain

            # adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=days_adjustment)
            if skip_bd.apply(other) != other:
                other = skip_bd.apply(other)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=business_remain)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                opening_time = (self._prev_opening_time(other) if is_positive else self._next_opening_time(other))
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)

                if is_positive:
                    bhour = closing_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                else:
                    bhour = other - opening_time
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the logic errors in adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours specified in the class. It ensures consistent and accurate adjustments to the datetime object `other`.
