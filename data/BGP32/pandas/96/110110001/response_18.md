### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class for handling business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the creation of a date range with custom business hours.
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation, specifically in the comparison of inferred frequency with the passed frequency.

### Bug Potential Location:
- The issue seems to lie in the logic for adjusting the business hours in the `apply` function.
- There might be a miscalculation or incorrect adjustment causing the frequency validation to fail.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is adjusting the given datetime using the specified business hours.
- The adjustment logic in the function may not be correctly handling the edge cases, causing the generated dates to have incorrect frequencies.
- This incorrect frequency leads to a validation error in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correct the adjustment logic within the `apply` function to ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the specified business hours.
- Ensure that the adjustment considers all edge cases and properly handles the transitions between business hours and days.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay, apply_wraps, ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and other not in self.start:
                n -= 1

        return other
```

- The corrected version of the `apply` function adjusts the datetime by iterating hour by hour based on the business hours specified.
- It correctly handles both positive and negative adjustments, ensuring that the adjusted datetime aligns with the business hours.

### Note:
- This corrected version assumes the possible adjustments required for aligning the datetime with business hours.
- Further testing may be required to ensure the function works correctly in all scenarios.
