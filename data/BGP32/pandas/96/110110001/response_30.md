### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not functioning properly, causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to raise a `ValueError`.
2. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.
3. The bug likely occurs in the logic of adjusting the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function, especially in handling the adjustments for negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust).
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the given number of business hours `n`.
5. The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected version of the `apply` function, the logic of adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours is fixed, and the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass without raising a `ValueError`.
