### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file seems to be causing an error in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file. The error message suggests that there is a validation issue related to the frequency of the `DatetimeIndex` objects.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment logic within the `apply` function for handling different scenarios based on positive and negative business hours.
2. Calculations related to adjusting business days and business hours.
3. Logic for checking and adjusting business time intervals.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect processing of business day adjustments and business hour adjustments within the `apply` function. This can lead to the incorrect calculation of business hours, resulting in an `Inferred frequency None` error when trying to create the `DatetimeIndex` object with a custom frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle adjustments for positive and negative business hours.
2. Ensure accurate calculation of business days and business hours in the adjustment logic.
3. Verify the logic for checking and adjusting business time intervals properly.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours / 3600)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r * 60)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correctly adjusting the business days, business hours, and business time intervals, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
