### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is supposed to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using custom business hours, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.
3. The bug in the `apply` function is likely causing an issue with the frequency validation, leading to the `ValueError` during the test execution.

### Bug in the Code:
The bug seems to be related to the way the `apply` function adjusts the datetime based on the business hours. This adjustment causes the resulting datetime to have a frequency that is not valid, leading to the `ValueError` during frequency validation in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts the datetime based on business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment does not result in an invalid frequency for the datetime index.
3. Update the logic to adjust the datetime correctly to maintain a valid frequency for the resulting datetime index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other += self._bhour
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other -= self._bhour
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By simplifying the adjustment logic to iterate over the number of business hours and adding or subtracting a fixed business hour delta, we can ensure that the resulting datetime index maintains a valid frequency, thus fixing the bug.
