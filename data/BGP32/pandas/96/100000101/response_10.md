### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply()` function arises from incorrect handling of datetime objects for adjustment within business hours. The function fails to properly process the business hour adjustments based on the input `other` datetime object and the specified business hours defined in the `self` object. This leads to incorrect adjustments and unexpected output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the given `other` datetime object.
2. Make sure that adjustments for both positive and negative business hour values are handled correctly.
3. Ensure proper calculations for business days and remaining business hours adjustments within the specified business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply()` function addresses the bug by ensuring proper adjustment calculations and handling of datetime objects within the specified business hours. The adjustments for business days and remaining business hours have been corrected to align with the expected values.
