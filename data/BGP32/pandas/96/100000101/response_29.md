The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of instances where `other` is already a `datetime` object instead of a `Timestamp` object. The function is trying to reset the timezone and nanosecond, which is unnecessary when `other` is already a `datetime`.

To fix this bug, we need to check the type of `other` before resetting its attributes. Additionally, we need to update the logic in the function to properly handle cases where the input is already a `datetime`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, BaseOffset):
        return NotImplemented
    elif isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes the necessary changes to handle the cases when the input is already a `datetime` object. The function now avoids unnecessary resetting of timezone and nanosecond attributes in such cases and correctly processes the input data.
