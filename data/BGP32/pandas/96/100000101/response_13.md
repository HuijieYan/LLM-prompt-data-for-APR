### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `other` parameter, specifically when adjusting it based on the business hour offsets. The function fails to correctly adjust the `other` parameter when iterating through the business time intervals, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the `other` parameter is done accurately within each business time interval while considering the business days' offsets.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # adjust timezone and nanosecond to match the timestamps
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # adjust within each business time interval
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                other += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                bhour_to_add = min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                if bhour_remain > bhour_to_add or (bhour_remain == bhour_to_add and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_to_add
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour_to_add - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the adjustment process within each business time interval, the corrected function should now accurately handle the different cases outlined in the expected scenarios.
