### Bug Explanation
The bug in the given function is due to errors in handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. The function fails to properly adjust the input parameter `other` based on the business hour rules defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. This leads to incorrect calculations and returns the wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly adjust `other` based on the business days and remaining business hours while considering the start and end times defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The adjustment logic should ensure that the output adheres to the expected behavior specified in the input test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # handle edge case
        if n >= 0 and (other.hour, other.minute) >= (self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and (other.hour, other.minute) < (self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * businesshours // 60), 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            while not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.seconds > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.seconds > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected function now properly adjusts the input datetime based on the business hour rules, handling both positive and negative offsets as per the specified business hours.
