### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of the `other` input parameter which is expected to be a `datetime` object but can sometimes be a `Timestamp`. The function directly manipulates the `other` object assuming it is a `datetime` object, leading to errors when it is a `Timestamp`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `other` parameter is properly converted to a `datetime` object before processing it further. This can be done by adding a check to convert `Timestamp` to `datetime` before any manipulation.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # convert Timestamp to datetime if necessary
        if hasattr(other, "to_pydatetime"):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Rest of the function remains the same...

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction ensures that the `other` parameter is properly converted to a `datetime` object before any operations are performed on it. This will prevent errors when the input is a `Timestamp`.
