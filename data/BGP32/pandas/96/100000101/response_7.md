### Analysis:
1. The function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the adjustment of business hours, especially when shifting to the next business day.
3. The bug could be causing incorrect adjustments when the given datetime is on the edge condition of business hours or when moving to the next business day.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of business hour adjustments when moving across different business days.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the given datetime is adjusted considering the start and end of business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. Properly handle the adjustment for moving to the next business day based on the specified business hours.
3. Update the logic for handling different cases of business hours adjustment to align with the expected behaviour.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Justification:
1. Adjusted the logic for moving to the next business day to ensure proper handling of different cases.
2. Changed the adjustment process to align with adjusting business hours accurately.
3. Treated negative business day shifts correctly when moving to the previous business day.
4. Updated the function to handle all cases of business hour adjustments as per the expected behaviour.
