### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises due to an incorrect handling of conditional statements related to adjusting the business hours with a given timestamp. There are several issues with the logic that lead to incorrect adjustments being made to the timestamp.

1. The `if` condition checks for `n >= 0` to adjust the timestamp based on the business hours. However, the subsequent code within that block does not correctly handle these adjustments causing the timestamp to be incorrectly modified.

2. The calculation of business hours using `self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)` is assumed to be incorrect as it does not align with the expected business hours for the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

3. The logic for adjusting the timestamp based on remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) is flawed and leads to incorrect timestamps being returned in some cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `apply` function needs to be corrected. The adjustments made to the timestamp based on the business hours and remaining hours have to be revised to align with the expected behavior for the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

1. Adjust the timestamp based on whether the number of business hours `n` is positive or negative.
2. Ensure correct calculation of business hours within a day using the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
3. Fix the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on remaining business hours to accurately reflect the business hour intervals.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other_date = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other_date):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, prev_open.hour, prev_open.minute, prev_open.second)
                other = prev_open + BaseOffset(n=bd) + remain
            else:
                other += BaseOffset(n=bd)

        while r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if r < bhour.seconds / 60:
                other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                break
            else:
                r -= bhour.seconds / 60
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected function provided above, the code should now accurately adjust the given timestamp based on the `CustomBusinessHour` object and its specific business hours defined.
