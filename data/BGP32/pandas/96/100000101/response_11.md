### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours with respect to a given datetime input. The function is expected to adjust the input datetime according to the specified CustomBusinessHour object, but it fails to do so correctly.

#### Issues:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours.
2. Potential errors in handling edge cases and time intervals.
3. Incorrect comparison and calculations related to business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of business days and business hours based on the input parameters.
2. Proper handling of edge cases and time intervals to accurately adjust the datetime.
3. Correct comparisons and calculations related to business hours to accurately adjust the datetime.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond to handle Timestamp properly
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) + timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function focuses on accurately adjusting the input datetime based on the specified CustomBusinessHour object by correctly handling business days, business hours, and edge cases. It should now satisfy all the expected cases provided.
