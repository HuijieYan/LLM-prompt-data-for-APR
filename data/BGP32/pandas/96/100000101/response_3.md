The bug in the provided function occurs because when the `other` parameter is a datetime object, it is modified directly in place within the function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should create a new datetime object instead of modifying the input `other` directly. This will ensure that the original `other` value remains unchanged. Additionally, we need to correct the adjustment logic for business days and business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other_copy = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        adjusted_time = self._adjust_time(other_copy, n)
        return self._adjust_remaining_business_hours(adjusted_time, n, nanosecond)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_time(self, other, n):
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    return other

def _adjust_remaining_business_hours(self, other, n, nanosecond):
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )

    bd, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd = -bd
        remaining_minutes = -remaining_minutes

    if bd != 0:
        other = self._adjust_business_days(other, bd)

    return self._adjust_hours_within_business_time(other, remaining_minutes, nanosecond)

def _adjust_business_days(self, other, bd):
    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        remain = other - prev_open
        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    else:
        other += skip_bd
    
    return other

def _adjust_hours_within_business_time(self, other, minutes, nanosecond):
    remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=minutes)
    
    while remaining_time.total_seconds() != 0:
        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            current_bhour = closing_time - other
            if remaining_time < current_bhour:
                other += remaining_time
                remaining_time = timedelta(0)
            else:
                remaining_time -= current_bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(opening_time)
        else:
            current_bhour = opening_time - other
            if remaining_time > current_bhour or (remaining_time == current_bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += remaining_time
                remaining_time = timedelta(0)
            else:
                remaining_time -= current_bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
    return other
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly adjust the given datetime object according to the provided business hour settings without modifying the input directly. It also ensures correct adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.
