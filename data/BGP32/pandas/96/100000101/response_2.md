### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime value based on a set of business hours specified by the user. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect adjustments. One noticeable issue is the incorrect usage of datetime objects, especially concerning resetting the timezone and nanosecond of the input datetime value.

The buggy function performs various manipulations on the input datetime value to adjust it based on the provided business hours. The adjustments involve checking whether the input datetime is within the specified business hours, moving to the next opening time, handling negative adjustments for business days, and adjusting the remaining business hours.

### Bug:
The main issue in the buggy function is the incorrect usage and handling of datetime objects, resulting in unexpected behavior when performing the adjustments based on the input parameters. Resetting the timezone and nanosecond of the input datetime directly affects the time values, leading to incorrect adjustments based on business hours.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid resetting the timezone and nanosecond of the input datetime directly. Instead, we should focus on manipulating the time components of the datetime values accurately to perform the required adjustments based on the business hours provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # adjust by business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        adjusted_datetime = other

        for _ in range(abs(bd)):
            if n >= 0:
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            else:
                adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime = adjusted_datetime + BusinessDay(n=n)

        remaining_seconds = r * 60 if n >= 0 else -r * 60
        adjusted_datetime += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
        
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustments by focusing on business hours and correctly applying the changes to the datetime values without altering their time components improperly.

The corrected version should now accurately adjust the input datetime based on the specified business hours for all the provided test cases.
