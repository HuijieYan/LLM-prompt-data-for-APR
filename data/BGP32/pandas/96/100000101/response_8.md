### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect assumption that `other` is always a `datetime` object, leading to errors when trying to access attributes specific to `Timestamp` objects. This inconsistency causes issues in handling different input types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the type of `other` before assuming it is a `datetime` object.
2. Convert `Timestamp` objects to `datetime` objects if necessary to ensure consistent handling.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (date, datetime)):
        # Convert Timestamp objects to datetime objects
        if hasattr(other, "to_pydatetime"):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        n = self.n

        ...
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
