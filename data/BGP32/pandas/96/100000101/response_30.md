The bug in the function lies in the calculation of business hours and the adjustments made to the timestamp based on the business hour offset. The function fails to handle cases where the adjustment requires moving to the next business time interval correctly.

To address the bug, we should modify the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the business hour offset and handle the edge cases more robustly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustments to the timestamp more accurately based on the business hour offset. It takes into account the calculation of business days and remaining business hours to adjust the timestamp correctly. The function now satisfies the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
