### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime `other` based on a set of business hours specified by the `self` parameter. The function calculates the number of business days and remaining business hours to adjust the given datetime accordingly.

### Bugs Identified:
1. Incorrect data type conversion: The function converts the `other` parameter, which should be a Timestamp, to a datetime object, leading to potential data loss and incorrect calculations.
2. Improper handling of business day adjustment: The function does not handle the adjustment of business days accurately, leading to potential errors in the calculation of business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `other` parameter remains as a Timestamp object for accurate time calculations.
2. Modify the business day adjustment logic to correctly adjust the datetime based on the specified business days.

### Bug Fix in the Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bday_offset = self.offset * 60

        # adjust by business days first
        if n:
            other_weekday = other.weekday()
            if n > 0:
                while n:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() not in [5, 6] and other not in self.holidays:
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n:
                    other -= pd.Timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() not in [5, 6] and other not in self.holidays:
                        n += 1

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = n * 60

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain:
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other).seconds // 60
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = 0
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + pd.Timedelta(minutes=bhour))
        else:
            while bhour_remain:
                bhour = (self._next_opening_time(other) - other).seconds // 60
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = 0
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + pd.Timedelta(minutes=bhour - 1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with Timestamp")
```

This corrected function retains the Timestamp type for the `other` parameter and adjusts business days accurately before handling the remaining business hours. The revised logic ensures correct datetime calculations based on the specified business hours.
