### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises due to the incorrect handling of business days and business hours adjustments. Specifically, the function fails to properly adjust the datetime value according to the specified business hours and days. This results in incorrect adjustments and potentially wrong outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is essential to accurately adjust the datetime value based on the specified business hours and days. This involves calculating the remaining business hours and days, handling edge cases such as weekends or holidays, and properly moving the datetime value to the appropriate business time intervals.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0)
        
        # Adjusting the time with the hour and minute information
        dt_time = datetime.strptime(str(other.time()), '%H:%M:%S')
        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), dt_time)
        
        # Business days and hours adjustment
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Business hours calculation
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Business days adjustment first
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            business_day = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + business_day
        
        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the bugs in the original function by properly adjusting the datetime values based on business days and hours. It ensures accurate handling of datetime adjustments within the specified business time intervals.
