### Bug analysis:
The buggy function is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on a specified CustomBusinessHour object. However, there are some inconsistencies in the logic that lead to incorrect adjustments. 

1. The initial replacement of the `other` timestamp by creating a new `datetime` object with the same year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond is redundant and can potentially lead to incorrect handling of time zone and nanosecond information.

2. The logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the `n` parameter is convoluted and contains potential errors in handling negative values of `n`, business days adjustments, and remaining business hours adjustments.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Avoid resetting the `other` timestamp by creating a new `datetime` object and retain the original timestamp as it is without losing track of nanosecond and time zone information.

2. Simplify the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the `n` parameter by explicitly handling positive and negative cases separately and ensuring correct business days and remaining business hours adjustments.

### Corrected function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd = divmod(abs(n), len(self))  # calculate the number of business days to adjust
        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd  # adjust for negative values

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = bd * self.next_bday
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += skip_bd
            else:
                remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd + remain

        # calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        r = n % len(self)
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r * 60)

        # adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n > 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if abs(bhour_remain) >= abs(bhour):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function simplifies the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the `n` parameter, ensuring a clear separation between positive and negative cases while handling business days and remaining business hours adjustments accurately.
