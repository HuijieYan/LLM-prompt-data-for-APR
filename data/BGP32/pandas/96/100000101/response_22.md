### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given timestamp (`other`) based on business hours specified by `self` (CustomBusinessHours object). The function handles positive and negative adjustments differently, skipping non-business hours and adjusting for business days if necessary. However, there are errors in the logic that lead to incorrect adjustments and potentially inconsistent behaviors.

The main issues in the buggy function are:
1. Inconsistent handling of positive and negative adjustments.
2. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours.
3. Incorrect handling of edge cases involving start and end times.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for both positive and negative adjustments to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, proper handling of remaining business hours and edge cases for start and end times must be implemented.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        if n >= 0:
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta():
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta()
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function ensures consistent handling of positive and negative adjustments, correct calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours, and proper treatment of edge cases involving start and end times. This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
