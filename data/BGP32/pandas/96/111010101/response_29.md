### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is likely causing the ValueError in the test case due to incorrect handling of the frequency validation in the apply function. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The apply function is designed to adjust a given timestamp based on the custom BusinessHour defined by the class. It adjusts the timestamp by the specified number of business hours (self.n).

The bug seems to be related to the frequency setting within the custom BusinessHour class, which is leading to a validation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the apply function, we should ensure that the frequency setting and validation are correctly handled. This involves verifying that the inferred frequency matches the expected frequency, and validating that the custom BusinessHour frequency conforms to the timestamp passed.

```

By updating the frequency validation method and ensuring that the CustomBusinessHour class handles frequencies correctly, the bug should be fixed, and the apply function should work as expected.
