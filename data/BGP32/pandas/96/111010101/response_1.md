### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given `datetime` value based on a specified set of business hours. However, the function is raising a `ValueError` during a specific test case related to a custom business hour representing 15:00-17:00.

The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the provided parameters and performs the datetime adjustments. It appears that the business hour calculation logic may not be correctly adjusting the datetime values within the specified business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be originating from incorrect logic in adjusting the provided `datetime` values within the specified business hours. The error arises when validating the frequency for the custom business hour, indicating a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime values within the specified business hours is correct.
2. Check the calculation of `businesshours` and make sure it accurately represents the total business hours in one business day.
3. Verify how weekdays, holidays, and the next business day are handled in adjusting the datetime values.
4. Validate the inference of the frequency and its compatibility with the provided `datetime` values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the adjustment logic within the function, we can address the bug causing the `ValueError` and ensure that the function properly adjusts the input datetime values based on the custom business hours.
