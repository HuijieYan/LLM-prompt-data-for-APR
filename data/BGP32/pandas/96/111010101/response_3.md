### Bug Analysis
The bug is causing a ValueError to be raised during the test execution because the inferred frequency from the values passed does not conform to the passed frequency. This issue originates in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The bug appears to be related to how the business hours are being adjusted in the function, leading to incorrect timing calculations.

### Bug Cause
1. The logic for adjusting business hours based on the provided frequency is incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of the remaining business hours to adjust within the specified time intervals.
3. Handling of business days adjustment is leading to unexpected behavior.
4. The adjustment of the `other` datetime object is lacking correct consideration for business hour boundaries.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment of the datetime object `other` needs to be done correctly for both positive and negative business hour offsets. Additionally, ensure proper handling of remaining business hours to adjust and adjusting for business days. The adjustment logic needs to align with the business hours specified and handle edge cases effectively.

### Code Fix
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class based on the analysis and bug causes provided:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing functions here...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                # Adjust to the next opening time if necessary
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Adjust using business days first
            if n != 0:
                other += BusinessDay(n=n)
    
            # Calculate remaining time based on business hours
            remaining_minutes = abs(n) * 60 % self.businesshours()
            if n < 0:
                remaining_minutes = -remaining_minutes
    
            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                time_until_closing = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if remaining_minutes > time_until_closing.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic based on the provided business hours and handling the remaining time appropriately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
