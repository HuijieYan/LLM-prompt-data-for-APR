### Analysis:
The buggy function applies business hours adjust to a given datetime object. The bug seems to be related to the comparison between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError` during the frequency validation. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is `None`, causing the failure.

### Bug:
Upon examining the buggy function, the issue lies in how the time adjustments and calculations are performed. Specifically in the `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods, where the adjustments lead to a lack of an inferred frequency. This ultimately triggers the `ValueError` during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the time adjustments conducted by the methods (`_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`) in the function result in correct timestamp objects with properly inferred frequencies. By ensuring that the adjustments align with the datetime calculations, we can prevent the `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0 and (other.hour, other.minute) not in [(e.hour, e.minute) for e in self.end]:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and (other.hour, other.minute) not in [(s.hour, s.minute) for s in self.start]:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        # perform business hour adjustments
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:  # move forward in time
                other += self.time_off_between_hours(other)
                n -= 1
            else:  # move backward in time
                other -= self.time_off_between_hours(other, back=True)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the time based on the business hours and handling the adjustments correctly, we can ensure that the function returns the expected output without triggering the `ValueError` during frequency validation.
