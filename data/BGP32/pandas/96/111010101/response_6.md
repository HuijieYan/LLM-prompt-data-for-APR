### Analysis
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to a ValueError being raised during the frequency validation process. This error occurs when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. The error is triggered by the failing test case with a CustomBusinessHour frequency. The bug is likely in the logic related to the frequency validation check within the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Bug Identification
1. The error is raised due to a mismatch between inferred frequency and passed frequency.
2. The failing test case involves CustomBusinessHour frequency, which triggers the error.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is None, while the expected frequency is 'CBH'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the expected frequency. We need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly infer and validate the frequency for the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Corrected Function
```python
# Import necessary modules
import numpy as np

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic within the function to handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency properly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results for all input scenarios.
