### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function involves several calculations and adjustments related to business hours, timedelta operations, and datetime comparisons.
3. The error message "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH" suggests a discrepancy in inferred frequency and passed frequency.
4. The function is designed to manipulate datetime values based on business hours and handle edge cases.
5. The identified bug seems to be related to the inference of frequency based on the input parameters, causing a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug appears to stem from a mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError` being raised. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the calculated frequencies align appropriately with the expected values. By investigating the frequency generation logic and confirming the compatibility between inferred and passed frequencies, we can address the bug.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        is_valid_freq = False
        for freq in other.freqstr.split(" "):
            if freq == self.freqstr:
                is_valid_freq = True
                break

        if not is_valid_freq:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency")

        # the rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
```

This corrected version explicitly checks the inferred frequency against the passed frequency to ensure compatibility. If they do not match, it raises an error to handle the discrepancy accurately. This modification should resolve the issue causing the `ValueError` during the test execution.
