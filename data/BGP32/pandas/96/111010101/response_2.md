## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function occurs due to an issue related to handling business hours in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function is supposed to adjust the input datetime value based on the specified business hours, such as the start and end times of business operations, holidays, etc. However, the bug causes the function to throw a `ValueError` at certain points during execution, leading to test failures.

The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency and the specified frequency (CBH). This occurs because the logic for adjusting business hours in the function is not correctly handling the given parameters, leading to inaccuracies in the calculated time values. This discrepancy results in the failure of the frequency validation check, triggering the `ValueError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to review the logic responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on the specified CustomBusinessHour settings. We should ensure that the calculations related to business days, business hours, and time intervals are correctly implemented to align with the expected behavior of the CustomBusinessHour class.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
1. Make sure the adjustment of the input datetime considers the specified business hours (start and end times), holidays, and other settings defined in the CustomBusinessHour class.
2. Verify the handling of negative business hours to adjust backward in time correctly.
3. Check the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.
4. Ensure that the function returns the adjusted datetime value without triggering any errors related to frequency validation.

Following these steps will help in correcting the bug and ensuring that the `apply` function operates as expected based on the provided CustomBusinessHour settings.

## Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the input datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour settings
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the function with the adjusted logic, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now return the adjusted datetime value accurately based on the specified CustomBusinessHour settings.
