### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to business hours calculations.
2. The error message suggests that there is a ValueError being raised during the validation of a frequency with a datetime index.
3. The buggy code seems to be incorrectly handling the frequency validation with a CustomBusinessHour frequency.
4. The bug may be related to how the frequency is validated and whether it conforms to the expected frequency for a given datetime index.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation checks are correctly implemented to avoid the ValueError being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the frequency validation code in the `_validate_frequency` method to ensure it correctly handles the specified frequency.
2. Check for mismatches between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency to identify the root cause of the ValueError.
3. Adjust the frequency validation to conform to the expected behavior for the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
from pandas.core.base import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # frequency validation
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to frequency validation, which should prevent the ValueError from being raised during the test execution.
