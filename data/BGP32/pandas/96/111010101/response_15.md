### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on a specified business hour offset, taking into account weekends, holidays, and non-fixed business durations. The function adjusts the input datetime according to business hours and specific business day logic.

The error message is related to a failure in validating the frequency of a generated range against expected values. This validation error halts the test execution.

### Bug:
The bug seems to arise from the mismatch in the frequency validation process, specifically when comparing the inferred frequency from passed values with the given frequency value. This leads to a ValueError when the frequencies do not match.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency and the provided frequency align correctly during validation. We should review the `_validate_frequency` method related to this bug. A potential fix involves adjusting the comparison logic to properly handle the frequency validation check.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid datetime object provided")
    
    n = self.n
    freq = self._get_freq()

    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._hour_until_closing(other)
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    else:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._time_until_opening(other)
            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

    return other
```

This corrected version should resolve the validation issue and align the inferred frequency with the expected frequency when generating the range based on the provided business hour offset.
