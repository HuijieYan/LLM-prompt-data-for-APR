### Analysis
1. The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has an issue where it throws a `ApplyTypeError` exception if the input `other` is not an instance of `datetime`.
2. The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of the `other` input when it is not a `datetime` object.
3. The function should be modified to gracefully handle the case when `other` is not a `datetime` object and return an appropriate error message without raising an exception.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Check the type of the `other` input at the beginning of the `apply` function.
2. If `other` is not an instance of `datetime`, return an error message indicating that only `datetime` objects can be used with the function.
3. If `other` is a `datetime` object, continue with the current logic.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # continue with the existing logic for datetime objects
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            # adjust other based on business hours
            # remaining code remains the same
            
        return other
```

By updating the `apply` function to perform an initial type check on the `other` input, we ensure that only `datetime` objects are processed further within the function. If the input is not of the expected type, the function will raise an `ApplyTypeError` with an appropriate error message.
