### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the way the frequency is being validated within the DatetimeIndex creation process. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour). This mismatch causes a `ValueError` to be raised.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency passed (`CBH`) conforms to the inferred frequency generated during the creation of the DatetimeIndex. This can be achieved by adjusting the validation process in the `_validate_frequency` method of the DatetimeArray class.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, the frequency validation issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
