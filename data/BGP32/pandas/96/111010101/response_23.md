### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object (`other`) based on a set of business hour rules. The function is intended to handle cases where the input `datetime` falls outside the defined business hours and adjust it accordingly.

The error message indicated a `ValueError` is being raised during the validation of the frequency when using a CustomBusinessHour frequency with a timestamp array. This issue is likely causing the failing test case.

### Bug Identification
1. The function `apply` is being used as a decorator with `@apply_wraps`, but it doesn't seem to be designed as a method with `self` parameter.
2. It's unclear where `ApplyTypeError` is imported from. This may lead to the error message not being displayed correctly during the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the incorrect usage of the `apply` function with the `@apply_wraps` decorator. This incorrect usage might lead to issues with passing parameters and data within the function, causing unexpected behavior such as the `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Remove the `@apply_wraps` decorator from the `apply` function.
2. Adjust the function to accept `self` as the first parameter to align it with a method within a class.
3. Ensure that the `ApplyTypeError` exception is correctly imported to handle the error messaging.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the suggested fix above, the modified function should be able to handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test.
