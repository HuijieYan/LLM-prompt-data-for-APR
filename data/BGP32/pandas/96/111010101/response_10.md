### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours specified by the class `CustomBusinessHour`. The function seems to adjust the input timestamp using business hours but fails to return the expected output.
2. The function contains several conditional blocks with adjustments to the input timestamp based on whether the number of business hours is positive or negative.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised in the `_validate_frequency` method, suggesting that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This error is likely caused by incorrect adjustment within the `apply` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp based on the number of business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the timestamp based on the specified business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are made accurately while considering both positive and negative cases for the number of business hours.
3. Confirm that the return value of the function matches the expected adjusted timestamp.
