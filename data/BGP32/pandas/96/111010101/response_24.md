### Analysis
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
- The function takes an input `other` which is expected to be a `datetime` object.
- The function performs calculations based on the input `other` and various attributes of the class.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised, specifically because the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

### Bug
- The bug seems to be related to how the frequency is handled in the function, which leads to a mismatch that triggers the `ValueError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the `freq.freqstr` value to correctly identify the passing of the frequency.
2. Ensure that the frequency matches the expected format for the applied business hours.
3. Adjust the logic related to frequency handling to correctly identify and validate the frequency against the inputs.
4. Make sure that the error message is informative.
5. Test the corrected function against the provided test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust based on the sign of n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    # Move to previous day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Calculate total business hours
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the provided test cases.
