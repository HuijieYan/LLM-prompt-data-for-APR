## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour object. The function uses various calculations and conditions to adjust the input datetime based on the business hours defined in the business hour object. The bug seems to be related to the mismatch between the input frequency and the expected frequency derived from the datetime values. This leads to a ValueError being raised during the validation process in the `_validate_frequency` function.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hour adjustments on datetime objects.
2. The main issue arises when the frequency inferred from the passed values does not match the expected frequency derived from the datetime values.
3. This mismatch triggers a ValueError during the validation process, causing the test to fail.
4. The bug is related to how the frequencies are validated and compared, leading to incorrect passing frequency information.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the frequencies derived from the datetime values align with the expected frequency. This can be achieved by making adjustments to the way frequencies are validated and compared during the process.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import is_period_dtype
import numpy as np

# Existing function definitions...


@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on n value
        if n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hour adjustments
        while n != 0:
            if n < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n = n - 1 if n > 0 else n + 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By replacing the timezone information and setting the microsecond to zero, we ensure that the frequency values derived from datetime objects are aligned with the expected frequency. This should resolve the ValueError issue and make the function work correctly for the provided test cases.
