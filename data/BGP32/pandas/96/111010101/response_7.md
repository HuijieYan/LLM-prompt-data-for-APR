### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours and days according to the specified CustomBusinessHour object. It calculates the adjusted datetime value based on the business hours and days specified by the CustomBusinessHour object.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the validation of the frequency for a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex, implying there is an issue in the frequency validation logic.
3. The buggy function is being called with different inputs and the expected results include adjusting datetime values based on the CustomBusinessHour object. The bug could be related to how the adjustments are made in the function.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug could involve checking the logic related to adjusting the datetime values based on the business hours and days. The error message is indicating a discrepancy between inferred frequency and the passed frequency, so adjusting these validations might resolve the issue.
5. In the corrected version, we will address the frequency validation logic and ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime values align with the expected behavior.


### Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BaseOffset
from pandas import DatetimeIndex

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Validate frequency with the passed values
            inferred = self.inferred_freq
            if self.size == 0 or inferred == self.freqstr:
                return None

            # Perform frequency validation
            try:
                on_freq = self._generate_range(start=self[0], end=None, periods=len(self), freq=self)
                if not self.array_equal(self.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
                    raise ValueError
            except ValueError as e:
                if "non-fixed" in str(e):
                    raise e
                raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {self.freqstr}")

            # Rest of the existing logic for adjusting datetime values
            # ... 
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By modifying the frequency validation logic in the function, we should be able to resolve the `ValueError` encountered during the test execution.
