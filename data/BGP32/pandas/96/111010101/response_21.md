### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hours, adjusting a given datetime based on the business hours specified.
2. The buggy function manipulates the `other` datetime object based on the business hours defined by the `self` object.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised when validating the frequency in a certain condition, specifically related to the CustomBusinessHour offset.
4. The bug seems to be causing a validation failure when the frequency identified from the passed values does not conform to the expected frequency.
5. The issue is likely due to incorrect frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method.
6. To fix this bug, the condition for the frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method needs to be adjusted to handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Inspect the `_validate_frequency` method where the ValueError is raised.
2. Adjust the condition for frequency validation to correctly identify the CustomBusinessHour frequency and avoid the ValueError.
3. Implement the necessary changes to ensure the frequency validation aligns with the expected behavior when using CustomBusinessHour.
