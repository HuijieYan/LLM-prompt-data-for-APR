### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on custom business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function is failing to correctly adjust the input `datetime` object based on the custom business hours.

Upon analyzing the code and error message, the bug seems to be related to the validation of the frequency of the `CustomBusinessHour` object, leading to a `ValueError` being raised during the date range generation. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation for the `CustomBusinessHour` object is correctly handled. Specifically, we need to compare the inferred frequency with the passed frequency in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix
Here is the fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# Assume the necessary imports are present

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Prevent resetting the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Calculate total business hours per day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain = bhour - bhour_remain
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary
The bug in the original `apply` function was related to frequency validation, which was causing a `ValueError` during the date range generation. The fix involves adjusting the function logic for handling business hours properly based on the given `datetime` input and the specified business hours. With these modifications, the function should now correctly adjust the input datetime object based on custom business hours without raising any errors.
