### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is not properly adjusting the input datetime `other` based on the specified business hours. There are issues with adjusting the datetime for positive and negative business hours cases. The function is not correctly handling the logic to move to the next opening time or previous closing time.

The main cause of the bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the business hours within a day, especially when moving between different business time intervals.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the input datetime `other` is properly adjusted based on the specified business hours before performing further calculations.
2. Check the adjustments for positive and negative business hours separately and handle the business day adjustments correctly.
3. Adjust the remaining business hours to reach the final adjusted datetime.
4. Make necessary changes to the logic for moving between different business time intervals and adjusting the datetime accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                # Move to next opening time if needed
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Move to previous closing time if needed
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in a day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust for business days
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

After applying the suggested corrections, the function should now handle the business hour adjustments correctly and pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values for different scenarios.
