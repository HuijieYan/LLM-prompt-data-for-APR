### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is expected to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours defined in `self` (an instance of `CustomBusinessHour`). The function seems to have a logic error that causes it to fail when validating frequency during execution, leading to a ValueError.

The cause of the bug may be related to the adjustment of the input `other` datetime object within the function. The function is trying to adjust the date based on business hours but ends up generating an invalid frequency, causing the error during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment process is correctly updating the `other` datetime object based on business hours while maintaining the frequency integrity. Specifically, proper handling of adjustment iterations and time intervals is crucial to avoid frequency validation errors.

### Code Fix:
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should properly adjust the input datetime object according to the business hours specified in `self` without causing frequency validation issues.
