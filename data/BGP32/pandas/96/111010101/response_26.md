### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours. However, there seems to be an issue with how the adjustments are being made, leading to a `ValueError` during validation of the frequency. The bug is likely related to how the adjustments are calculated or applied to the input datetime.

### Bug
The bug seems to be in the calculation of adjustments, leading to an incorrect result and failing validation of the frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments align with the business hours and are correctly calculated.
3. Verify the handling of edge cases and validations to prevent the `ValueError`.

### Fixing the Bug
Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the datetime based on the specified custom business hours and should pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
