### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing issues with properly adjusting business hours when holidays are included in the frequency.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` showcases the problem when creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency and holidays specified.
- The error message emphasizes a validation error related to frequencies in the `DatetimeIndex` constructor.
- The corresponding GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the number of periods generated when using holidays in the `date_range` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to improper adjustment of business hours when holidays are involved in the frequency calculation. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated.
- The validation error arises when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the specified frequency, causing the ValueError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business hours with holidays are correctly handled to produce the expected number of periods in the date range.
- The adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to account for holidays and adjust the dates accordingly to align with the business hours.

            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the holiday checking logic and adjusting the date-time values accordingly within the `apply` function, the corrected version should now properly handle business hours with holidays and generate the expected number of periods in the date range.
