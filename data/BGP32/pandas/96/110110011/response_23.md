### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is located in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.
- The error message mentions a `ValueError` being raised during the test due to failing frequency validation.
- The GitHub issue describes a scenario where adding holidays results in unexpected behavior with `periods` in `pd.date_range`.

### Potential error locations:
- The calculation related to adjusting business days and business hours may not be handling holidays correctly.
- The calculation of frequencies may not be accurately reflecting the effect of holidays.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not properly handling the adjustment for holidays. This leads to incorrect calculations in the context of business hours and days, causing unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when holidays are included.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `apply` function to properly account for holidays. This will involve adjusting the business days and hours calculations to skip holidays and ensure accurate frequency calculation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # Adjust for holidays
    if self.after(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

    n = self.n
    if n >= 0:
        while n > 0:
            if other in self.end:
                other += timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to the next business opening time
            other += timedelta(minutes=60)
            n -= 1
    else:
        while n < 0:
            if other in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to the previous business closing time
            other -= timedelta(minutes=60)
            n += 1

    return other
```

Applying this corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the bug and ensure proper handling of holidays in the context of business hours and days calculation.
