### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays specified.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The GitHub issue describes a related problem where adding holidays causes more than the expected number of periods in the date range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the calculation of business days and the adjustment of business hours. The wrong calculation is causing the date range to be extended beyond the expected number of periods when holidays are specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of business days and business hours adjustment within the function aligns correctly with the specified holidays. Additionally, the adjustments made based on the provided dates should account for holidays to prevent the unexpected extension of the date range.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holidays = self.holidays
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            while other in holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            businessdays = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=holidays)
            other = businessdays.apply(other)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the handling of holidays, business days, and business hours within the function, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue described on GitHub.
