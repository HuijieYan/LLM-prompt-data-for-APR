### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and a holiday, but the output is incorrect.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurred during frequency validation with the custom business hours.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where adding a holiday causes `date_range` to produce more periods than expected.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how holidays are handled in the custom business hour offset calculation within the `apply` function. The incorrect adjustment of business days and hours seems to be causing the mismatch in the output.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour offset calculation properly handles holidays when adjusting the datetime value. This involves correctly adjusting for business days and hours around holidays to avoid the issue observed in the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
  
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
      
```

By correcting the adjustments for business days and hours around holidays in the `apply` function, the fixed version should now handle custom business hours with holidays correctly, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
