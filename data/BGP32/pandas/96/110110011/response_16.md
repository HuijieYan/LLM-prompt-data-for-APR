### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` demonstrates an issue when using custom business hours with holidays.
3. The error message indicates a validation error related to frequency when generating date ranges.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where adding holidays to custom business hours can lead to incorrect date ranges.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the calculation inside the `apply` function, particularly in adjusting the business days and business hours related to the start time. This causes an incorrect calculation of the date range when using custom business hours with holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to properly account for holidays and ensure that the date range generated with custom business hours is correct.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self._business_hours * self._granularity)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the buggy logic related to adjusting business days and business hours in the `apply` function, ensuring that the date ranges are calculated correctly when using custom business hours with holidays.
