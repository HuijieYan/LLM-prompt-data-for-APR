## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when used in combination with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` illustrates the problem by generating incorrect datetime values when a holiday is included in the frequency. The error message from the failing test indicates a `ValueError` due to frequency validation.

The GitHub issue reported by a user also highlights a similar problem where adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency results in unexpected datetime values being generated.

## Bug and Cause
The bug in the `apply` function seems to stem from the handling of holidays in the custom business hour offset. When holidays are present, the current logic does not adjust the business hours correctly, leading to an incorrect calculation for the number of periods in the frequency.

The faulty logic in determining the next opening time after accounting for holidays could be causing the datetime values to be offset by an incorrect number of periods.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to adjusting the business hours when holidays are included in the custom business hour frequency. Specifically, the adjustment process during the selection of the next opening time needs to be updated to correctly handle holidays and maintain the intended behavior of the frequency.

## Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other <= self._get_closing_time(other):  # Ensure within business hours range
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to next opening time

        n = self.n
        while n != 0:  # Continue adjusting until target business hours reached
            if n > 0:  # Moving forward
                other += timedelta(days=1)  # Move to the next day
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):  # Check if valid business hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to next opening time
                n -= 1  # Decrement remaining business hours count
            else:  # Moving backward
                other -= timedelta(days=1)  # Move to the previous day
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):  # Check if valid business hour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)  # Move to previous opening time
                n += 1  # Decrement remaining business hours count

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment process is restructured to handle holidays correctly and ensure that the datetime values are aligned with the custom business hour frequency. By iterating over the days and adjusting the datetime values based on the business hours, the corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub.
