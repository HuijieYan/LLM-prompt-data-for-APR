### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class has some issues related to calculating business days and business hours, which leads to incorrect date adjustment when working with custom business hours and holidays. This bug causes the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to occur. The failing test focuses on validating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays, raising a `ValueError` due to incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function.

### Error Cause
The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect adjustments when calculating business days and business hours, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering holidays while generating date ranges. The error message specifically points to a mismatch between inferred frequency and passed frequency, highlighting the inability to conform to the provided frequency within the context of holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in the calculation of business days and hours within the `apply` function. The key focus should be on correctly adjusting the dates while accounting for holidays to ensure that the date ranges are generated accurately according to the specified custom business hours.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.core.generic import NDFrame

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            current_offset = self._next_opening_time(other) if n < 0 else other
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_offset) - current_offset
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    current_offset += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                current_offset = self._next_opening_time(current_offset + bhour)
    
            return current_offset
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function related to the incorrect date adjustments, especially when holidays are involved, ensuring that the `apply` function can accurately handle custom business hours and holidays in generating date ranges.
