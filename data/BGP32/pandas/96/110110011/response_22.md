### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used for applying business hours to a given datetime.
2. The buggy function is failing when trying to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset with holidays using the `pd.date_range()` function.
3. The error message indicates a validation error related to frequencies of the given datetime index.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the exact problem where the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range()` with holidays is incorrect.
5. The issue seems to be related to how holidays are handled within the CustomBusinessHour offset.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply()` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. When holidays are included in the CustomBusinessHour offset, the adjustment of business hours is not being correctly calculated based on the provided holidays, resulting in incorrect period generation with the `pd.date_range()` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply()` function needs to correctly adjust for holidays when calculating the business hours. By considering holidays within the offset adjustments, the correct periods should be generated by `pd.date_range()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            ...
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_opening_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # Handling holidays to adjust business days
            if hasattr(self, "holidays"):
                for holiday in self.holidays:
                    if other.date() == holiday.date():
                        time_diff = other - holiday
                        if n >= 0:
                            if time_diff.total_seconds() >= 0:
                                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        else:
                            if time_diff.total_seconds() < 0:
                                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            ...
```

By including a section to handle holidays within the adjustment logic of the `apply()` function, the corrected version should properly calculate the business hours with holidays included. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that `pd.date_range()` works correctly with CustomBusinessHour offsets involving holidays.
