### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` with a custom frequency that includes holidays.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency when using periods in `pd.date_range` with custom business hours. The issue on GitHub highlights the discrepancy in the number of periods generated when holidays are added.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments for holidays during the calculation of business hours in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function to ensure the correct number of periods are generated.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function, which leads to discrepancies in the number of periods generated when using custom business hours with holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to properly account for holidays during the calculation of periods.
2. Ensure that holidays are taken into consideration when determining the opening and closing times for each business day.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps

            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating logic to adjust for holidays within the `apply` function, the corrected version should now generate the correct number of periods when using custom business hours with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
