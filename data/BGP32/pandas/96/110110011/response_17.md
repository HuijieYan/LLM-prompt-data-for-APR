### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue in the `CustomBusinessHour` functionality.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in `test_date_range.py` is showing incorrect behavior when using periods and adding holidays in `CustomBusinessHour`.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation not conforming to the expected frequency.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where adding holidays causes unexpected behavior in the date range generation with periods using `CustomBusinessHour`.
5. The cause of the bug is likely related to the calculation of business hours and adjustment logic within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of business days, business hours, and adjustment logic within the `apply` function. When holidays are introduced, the adjustment of business days and hours is not correctly accounted for, leading to unexpected results in the date range generation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and hours when dealing with holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour`. The adjustments should properly handle the impact of holidays on the date range generation with periods.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            adjusted_count = 0  # Counter for adjusted periods

            # Handle the adjustment logic for holidays
            while adjusted_count < self._periods:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                else:
                    adjusted_count += 1
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other + timedelta(hours=1))

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the adjustment logic to properly handle holidays and adjust business days and hours accordingly, the corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue.
