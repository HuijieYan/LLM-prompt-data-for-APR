## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is within a class called `BusinessHourMixin`.
2. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hour offsets.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is performing a date range operation with custom business hours and holidays, but due to the bug in the `apply` function, the expected result does not match the actual result.
4. The error message indicates a validation error related to frequency mismatches in the date range generation process.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the problem when adding holidays to date range generation with business hours.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours might be causing the issue.
2. The calculation of the new datetime seems to be incorrect when handling different time zones.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect adjustment calculation for business days and remaining business hours, leading to the mismatch in the generated date range frequencies when holidays are added.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours to accurately adjust the datetime with business hours.
2. Handle the addition of holidays correctly when generating the date range to ensure the frequencies align.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        original_other = other

        if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and (other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._get_closing_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(60 * n), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected changes to the `apply` function, the date range generation should work correctly with custom business hours and holidays as expected.
