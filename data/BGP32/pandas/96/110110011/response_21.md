### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting business hours based on the input `datetime` object.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but the result does not match the expected output due to a bug in the `apply` function.
- The corresponding error message highlights a ValueError raised during frequency validation, indicating a mismatch in inferred frequency.
- The GitHub issue reported a similar problem where adding holidays resulted in unexpected behavior in generating date ranges with custom business hours.

### Error Location:
- The bug likely occurs in the section of the `apply` function where adjustments are made based on business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `apply` function leads to incorrect adjustments when handling negative business hours for previous opening and closing times, resulting in shifted dates in the output.
- This bug, combined with the presence of holidays, causes unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with custom business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure correct adjustment of business days and business hours based on the sign of `n` (positive or negative).
- Accurately determine the opening and closing times based on the current datetime object and adjust accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # adjust other to the next or previous opening time as needed
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd + remain)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            # adjust remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                diff_time = self._end_n_opening_time(other) - other
                if n >= 0:
                    adj = min(bhour_remain, diff_time)
                else:
                    adj = min(bhour_remain, self._start_n_opening_time(other) - other)
                other += adj
                bhour_remain -= adj
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issues related to adjusting business hours correctly, especially in scenarios involving holidays. The updated code should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
