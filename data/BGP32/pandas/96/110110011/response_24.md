### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hour offsets with datetime objects.
2. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to test the functionality of custom business hours with holidays.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised during frequency validation in pandas codebase.
4. The GitHub issue points out that when using periods with holidays in `date_range` function, unexpected behavior occurs.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from the faulty logic in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect adjustments in business hours when holidays are introduced. This results in additional periods being calculated beyond the specified count.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, correct business hour adjustments need to be made in alignment with holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.

### Corrected Code: 
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to remove timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            while n != 0:
                holiday_adjust = 0
                
                if other in self.holidays:
                    holiday_adjust += 1
                    
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
                
                if holiday_adjust:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Test the corrected function
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    freq = CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

After correcting the `apply` function with the updated logic for adjusting business hours with holidays, the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without raising any errors. This fix aligns the adjustments correctly with holidays and produces the expected number of periods.
