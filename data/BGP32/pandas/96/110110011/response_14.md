### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class that adds functionality related to business hours.
2. The provided failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours with holidays.
3. The error message indicates a value error raised during validation of frequencies for a `DatetimeIndex`, suggesting an issue with frequency validation when using custom business hours with holidays.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where adding holidays to custom business hours results in unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely occurring in the logic related to adjusting business hours for holidays in the `apply` function. The issue arises when trying to calculate the next opening time during holiday cases, leading to the incorrect number of periods in the date range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When a holiday is encountered, the logic to adjust the opening time and closing time for the next business day is not correctly executed, leading to an offset in periods in the date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the handling of holidays needs to be improved in the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment of opening time and closing time during holiday scenarios should be modified to ensure that the correct number of periods is calculated.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        dt = other
        is_holiday = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") in self.holidays

        if n >= 0:
            while is_holiday or dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                if is_holiday:
                    dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
                    is_holiday = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") in self.holidays
                else:
                    dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)

        else:
            while is_holiday or dt.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                if is_holiday:
                    dt -= timedelta(days=1)
                    dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
                    is_holiday = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") in self.holidays
                else:
                    dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt))

        return dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling holidays is improved to adjust the opening and closing times correctly during holiday scenarios, ensuring that the correct number of periods is calculated in the date range.
