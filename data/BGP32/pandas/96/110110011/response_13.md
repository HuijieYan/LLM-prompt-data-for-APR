### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method of DatetimeArray.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where `pd.date_range` with periods and custom holidays produces unexpected results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by miscalculations and incorrect adjustments within the `apply` method when processing custom business hours with holidays. This results in the mismatch between expected and actual date ranges.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The adjustments for holidays and business hours need to be accurately handled in the `apply` function to ensure correct date range generation.
2. Look for places where adjustments are being made based on business hours and take holidays into account accordingly.
3. Ensure that the logic for adjusting dates based on custom business hours and holidays is correct.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_other = other

            def adjust_to_business_hour(other):
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                return other

            if n >= 0:
                other = adjust_to_business_hour(other)
            else:
                other = original_other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = adjust_to_business_hour(other)

            while True:
                if n > 0:
                    other += timedelta(1)
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        n -= 1
                elif n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(1)
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        n += 1
                else:
                    break

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic of date calculations based on business hours and holidays, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now generate the correct date range as expected in the failing test.
