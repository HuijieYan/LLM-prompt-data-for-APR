### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the file `test_date_range.py`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` when trying to validate the frequency in a `DatetimeIndex`.
- The GitHub issue mentions an unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the date range.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of the total business hours might be incorrect.
2. Adjustments for negative business day values may be causing issues.
3. Iterative adjustments within the while loops might not be working as intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes an incorrect number of periods to be generated in the date range when adding holidays, resulting in an extra day added to the sequence of dates. This is likely due to the handling of business days and adjustments within the `apply` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug:
1. Validate the logic for adjusting the dates based on business days.
2. Review the adjustment logic within the while loops to ensure correct date increments.
3. Verify that the business hour calculations are accurate.
4. Address any unexpected behavior related to holidays and date range generation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            other = CustomBusinessHour(start=other, holidays=self.holidays).apply_offsets(n=bd, bdayonly=True)
            other += CustomBusinessHour().apply_offsets(np.sign(n) * r, bdayonly=True)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustments by directly applying offsets to the `other` datetime object based on the calculated business days and remaining business hours. This should resolve the issues related to incorrect date generation when using periods and holidays.
