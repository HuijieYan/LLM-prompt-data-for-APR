### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is present in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
- The error message indicates a ValueError raised from `pandas/core/arrays/datetimelike.py` due to frequency validation.
- The GitHub issue points to a problem with `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, leading to incorrect number of periods.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs due to an issue in frequency validation within the `DatetimeArray` class, specifically in the `_validate_frequency` method.
- The `BusinessHourMixin` class's `apply` function is not handling the adjustment of business hours properly when combining dates with custom business hours and holidays.
- This leads to an unexpected number of periods being generated in the `date_range` function when holidays are added.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- Ensure proper adjustment of business hours when dealing with dates, holidays, and custom business hours.
- Review and adjust the logic in the `apply` function to handle the cases where holidays affect the number of periods in the date range generation.

### Corrected Version:
```python

        bd, bhour_remain = self._compute_business_adjustments(other)

        # adjust by business days first

    return bd, timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)

                other.year,
                other.month,

                end_time.microsecond,

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function provides proper adjustment for business hours when combining dates with custom business hours and holidays. This should resolve the issue and ensure the correct number of periods are generated in the `date_range` function.
