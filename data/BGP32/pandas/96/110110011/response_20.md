### Analysis:
- The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours, but it has a logic flaw causing incorrect results.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the issue in GitHub, where using holidays with `pd.date_range` and `periods` does not produce the expected result.
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequencies not conforming when holidays are used.
- The GitHub issue describes the specific problem where adding holidays leads to unexpected results when using `pd.date_range` with periods.
  
### Potential error locations:
- The logic for adjusting business hours in the `apply` function is causing the unexpected behavior.
- The incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours may be the source of the bug.
- The calculations related to adjusting time intervals within business hours could be problematic.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug likely stems from the incorrect handling of business days, business hours, and adjustments in the `apply` function.
- When adjusting for holidays, the function is not correctly computing the expected datetime based on business hours, leading to an incorrect output in the test case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the logic within the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime based on business hours, taking into account holidays and periods.
- Ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are calculated accurately to produce the expected output.
- Test the corrected function against the failing test to verify that the issue is resolved.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = opening_time
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug described in the failing test case and the related GitHub issue.
