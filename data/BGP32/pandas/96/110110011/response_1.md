### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file demonstrates the issue with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised while validating the frequency of the date range.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with `pd.date_range` producing unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When processing the date range with custom business hours and holidays, the function does not adjust holidays properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to correctly handle holidays while adjusting the date range. The adjustment for holidays should ensure that the correct number of periods is generated without additional unexpected dates.

### Corrected Version of `apply` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = as_datetime(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Correction Explanation:
1. Adjust the initial `datetime` conversion and assignment.
2. Modify the adjustment logic based on positive or negative business hours.
3. Ensure correct handling of opening and closing time comparisons.
4. Properly adjust the date range using the specified business hours.

By applying these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle custom business hours and holidays correctly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
