### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` fails with a `ValueError`.
- The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where `date_range` with holidays does not work as expected.
- The root cause of the issue seems to be related to how the business hours are calculated and adjusted, leading to incorrect date generation with holidays.

### Error Cause:
- The `apply` function is responsible for adjusting the given `datetime` based on business hours.
- The issue arises when holidays are involved, resulting in an incorrect number of periods or dates being generated.
- The logic for adjusting the date based on business hours does not account for holidays effectively.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic for adjusting the datetime to consider holidays correctly.
- Ensure that the adjustment aligns with the expected business hours while skipping holidays.
- Update the handling of negative business hours to reflect the correct behavior given holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Given datetime is a holiday")

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:

            other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, skip_bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        other = self._adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, n, r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_for_business_days(self, other, skip_bd):
    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        remain = other - prev_open
        return prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    return other + skip_bd

def _adjust_for_remaining_hours(self, other, n, r):
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        if n >= 0:
            other, bhour_remain = self._adjust_positive_hours(other, bhour_remain)
        else:
            other, bhour_remain = self._adjust_negative_hours(other, bhour_remain)

    return other

def _adjust_positive_hours(self, other, bhour_remain):
    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other

    if bhour_remain < bhour:
        other += bhour_remain
        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    else:
        bhour_remain -= bhour
        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
    return other, bhour_remain

def _adjust_negative_hours(self, other, bhour_remain):
    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
        other += bhour_remain
        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    else:
        bhour_remain -= bhour
        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
    return other, bhour_remain
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly adjusting the dates based on business hours with holidays taken into account.
