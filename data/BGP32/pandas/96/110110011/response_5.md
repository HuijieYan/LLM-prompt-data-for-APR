### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to custom business hours and handling of datetime offsets.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` specifies a scenario where a `CustomBusinessHour` is used with periods in a date range, resulting in unexpected output due to holidays.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError due to frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency (CBH).
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where using holidays with periods in `pd.date_range` causes unexpected results.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hours and holidays are properly handled in the `apply` function to align with the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of business hours when handling periods combined with custom business hours and holidays in the `apply` function. This leads to unexpected mixing of holidays and business hours, affecting the output of `pd.date_range`.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours while considering holidays. We should ensure that the custom business hours and holidays are properly integrated into the logic for determining the next valid datetime. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        business_days_passed = self._business_days_passed(other)

        if business_days_passed == 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            else:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)

        closed = self._date_ofset(other, business_days_passed)

        if business_days_passed < 0:
            closed = self._prev_opening_time(closed)
        else:
            if closed.time() in self.end:
                closed = self._next_opening_time(closed)
        
        if self._is_on_offset(closed):
            business_days_passed += 1

        next_offset = timedelta(0)
        if business_days_passed != 0:
            adjusted = BusinessDay(n=business_days_passed)._apply_partially(closed, self.on_offset)

            if adjusted.time() != closed.time():
                offset = timedelta(hours=closed.hour, minutes=closed.minute, seconds=closed.second)

                closed = closed.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0)
                closed += BusinessMinute(n=offset.total_seconds() // 60)._apply(closed, self.on_offset)

                next_offset = offset - timedelta(minutes=adjusted.minute * 60 + adjusted.second)

        remaining_offset = self._remaining_offset(other, closed) + next_offset

        adjusted = self._apply(remaining_offset, closed, self.on_offset)

        return adjusted
    
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, applying this corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure proper handling of custom business hours and holidays, aligning with the expected behavior in scenarios like the failing test case and the GitHub issue described.
