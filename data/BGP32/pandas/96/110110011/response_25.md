### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The error message mentions a `ValueError` related to frequency validation and points to the validation method `_validate_frequency` in `pandas/core/arrays/datetimelike.py`. The issue on GitHub indicates an unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect frequency calculation in the presence of holidays causing more periods than expected. The cause might be in the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function.
5. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling holidays and adjust the frequency calculation within the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling holidays and ensuring correct frequency calculation, this corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
