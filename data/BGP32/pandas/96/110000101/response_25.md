### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours. The function seems to be handling different cases for adjusting the input datetime for both positive and negative `n` values. However, the calculation and adjustment logic in the function seems to be causing unexpected behavior and output.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Calculation of `bd` and `r` may not be correct for negative `n` values.
2. The adjustment logic inside the while loops may not be working as expected for both positive and negative `n` values.
3. The `_is_on_offset` and `_next_opening_time` functions are used in the calculation but not defined in the provided code snippet.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from incorrect adjustment of the input datetime when applying custom business hours. The while loops used for adjusting the remaining business hours might be iterating incorrectly or not adjusting the datetime accurately according to the custom business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the calculation of `bd` and `r` for negative `n` values.
2. Review the adjustment logic inside the while loops to ensure accurate adjustment for both positive and negative `n` values.
3. Ensure that the `_is_on_offset` and `_next_opening_time` functions are defined and working correctly in the context of the provided code.

```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues identified and improves the adjustment logic to accurately adjust the datetime based on the custom business hours and the input `n` value. Make sure to define and implement the `_is_on_offset` and `_next_opening_time` functions appropriately in the context of the bug fix.
