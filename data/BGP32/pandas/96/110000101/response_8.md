### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hour configurations. However, there are several issues in the logic of the function that result in incorrect adjustments and unexpected return values. The primary issue lies in the calculations related to adjusting the business hours and days, causing the function to return incorrect datetime values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to carefully analyze the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days. Specifically, focus on how the function handles the calculation of business hour remainders and adjustments on different business days. By refining this logic, we can ensure that the function correctly adjusts the input datetime according to the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_time = self.start[0]
            end_time = self.end[0]
            business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start_time, end_time)
            total_seconds = abs(n * 60 * business_hours)
            
            new_date = other
            if n >= 0:
                while total_seconds > 0:
                    current_time = new_date.time()
                    if current_time >= end_time or not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                        new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                    else:
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                        time_diff = next_opening - new_date
                        if time_diff.total_seconds() <= total_seconds:
                            total_seconds -= time_diff.total_seconds()
                            new_date = next_opening
                        else:
                            new_date += timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
                            total_seconds = 0
            else:
                while total_seconds > 0:
                    current_time = new_date.time()
                    if current_time <= start_time:
                        new_date -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                        new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                        new_date = self._get_closing_time(new_date)
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                    time_diff = next_opening - new_date
                    if time_diff.total_seconds() <= total_seconds:
                        total_seconds -= time_diff.total_seconds()
                        new_date = next_opening
                    else:
                        new_date += timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
                        total_seconds = 0
            
            return new_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with the original function's logic and should now properly adjust the input datetime based on the custom business hours provided.
