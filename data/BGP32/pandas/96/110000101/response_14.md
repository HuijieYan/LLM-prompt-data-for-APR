### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function seems to stem from a logic error in handling the adjustment of business hours. The function is intended to adjust the input `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours. However, the adjustment logic seems to be flawed, resulting in incorrect calculations and potential infinite loops.

### Bug Location
The bug likely lies in the while loops where the function iterates over the remaining business hours to adjust. Based on the logic provided, there seems to be an issue with calculating the correct adjustment needed for the business hours, which leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the business hours in the while loops. We should ensure that the adjustment follows the specified business hours correctly and terminates appropriately.

### Corrected Function
Here is a corrected version of the function based on the provided input/output values and bug analysis:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_time = other
        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time) if n < 0 else adjusted_time

        if n != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            adjusted_time += skip_bd

        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=(abs(n)*60))

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should properly adjust the input datetime object based on the specified business hours and handle the scenarios outlined in the expected test cases.
