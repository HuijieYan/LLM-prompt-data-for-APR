### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function lies in the adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on the business hours. The code fails to correctly handle cases where `n` (the number of business hours to adjust) is negative, leading to incorrect adjustments and potential infinite loops.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where `n` is negative.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of `other` is done properly based on the business hours configuration.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from datetime import time

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if self.n >= 0:
                    # Find the next opening time
                    open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = open_time - other
                else:
                    # Find the previous closing time
                    close_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    bhour = other - close_time
                
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(open_time)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(close_time)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle both positive and negative adjustments of business hours accurately based on the provided business hours configuration.
