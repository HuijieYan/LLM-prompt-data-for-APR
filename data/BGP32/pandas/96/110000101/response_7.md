The buggy function applies business hours to a given datetime object, adjusting it based on the business hour intervals and the direction of adjustment. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and remaining business hours to adjust.

The strategy to fix the bug involves checking the conditions for adjusting business days and remaining business hours more thoroughly. Additionally, ensuring the correct calculation of the new datetime object after adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjust to the next opening time
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjust to the previous day's closing time
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjust to the next business hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(minutes=r)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
