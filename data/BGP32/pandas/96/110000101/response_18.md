### Issue:
The buggy function has several issues related to adjusting the datetime based on business hours. There are errors in the logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business time interval and calculating the remaining business hours.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business time interval.
2. Fix the calculation of remaining business hours.
3. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly made based on the specified business hours.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and return the expected values in all the given test cases.
