### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `apply` arises from the incorrect handling of the input parameter `other` if it is a `Timestamp`. In the buggy code, the function assumes the input is a `datetime` object, leading to errors in the handling of time intervals.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly works with `Timestamp` objects instead of assuming `datetime`. We need to handle business hours calculations appropriately based on time intervals for the given `Timestamp` input.

### Corrected Function
```python
    # this is the fixed function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function now correctly considers `Timestamp` input objects and adjusts the business hours calculations based on input time intervals. This corrected version should fulfill all the expected input/output values provided.
