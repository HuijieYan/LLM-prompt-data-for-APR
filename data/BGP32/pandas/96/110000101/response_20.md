The buggy function has issues with adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The main problem lies in how it calculates the remaining business hours to adjust and how it handles moving between business time intervals.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the datetime based on business hours and checking for edge conditions effectively. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
            new_time = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            # adjust other to the next or previous business hour based on n
            if n >= 0:
                if new_time.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(new_time):
                    new_time = self._next_opening_time(new_time)
            else:
                if new_time.time() in self.start:
                    new_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(new_time):
                    new_time = self._next_opening_time(new_time)
                    new_time = self._get_closing_time(new_time)
            
            # get total business hours by seconds in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if skip_bd.on_offset(new_time):
                new_time += skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(new_time)
                remain = new_time - prev_open
                new_time = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(new_time)
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = next_opening - new_time
                else:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(next_opening) - new_time
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    new_time += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    new_time = next_opening
            
            return new_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for calculating remaining business hours and moving between intervals, the corrected function should now handle datetime adjustments based on business hours accurately for the provided cases.
