### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given timestamp according to the business hours specified in the class instance. The function processes the input timestamp `other` based on the specified business hours, adjusting for time intervals, business days, and remaining business hours. The bug occurs in the adjustment logic within the while loops, where the conditionals and calculations could lead to incorrect adjustments. 

### Bug Cause:
1. In cases where `self.n` is negative, the adjustment in the while loop for negative `n` appears to be incorrect. The logic for adjusting `bhour_remain` and `other` may not correctly handle the scenario when the remaining business hours are equal to the current business hour.
2. The adjustment calculation involving `bhour` within the while loops might lead to inaccurate adjustments, especially in scenarios with specific time conditions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the adjustment logic within the while loops to ensure accurate and appropriate adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values.
2. Check the conditional statements and calculations related to `bhour` to correctly handle edge cases when remaining business hours align with the current business hour.

The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the inaccuracies in adjustment logic within the while loops and ensures correct handling of positive and negative `n` values. This version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
