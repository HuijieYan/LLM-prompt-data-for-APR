### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs due to the handling of the `other` parameter. The function checks if `other` is an instance of `datetime`, and if so, modifies `other` based on certain conditions. The bug arises when attempting to create a new `datetime` object from `other`, resulting in incorrect values and unexpected behavior when adjusting the time.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `other` parameter is correctly converted to a `datetime` object before performing any operations on it. Additionally, we should properly handle the adjustment of business days and business hours to ensure accurate time adjustments.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Create new datetime object with timezone removed
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on conditions
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours to adjust
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by properly converting `other` to a `datetime` object and adjusting it according to the business hours and days. It ensures accurate time adjustments and returns the expected values for the given cases.
