### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises due to an incorrect check for whether `other` is on the specified offset. The function is intended to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object. However, when adjusting `other` based on the business hours offset, the logic for checking if `other` is on the offset is flawed. This results in incorrect adjustments and potentially incorrect return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for checking if `other` is on the specified business hours offset needs to be revised. Proper adjustments must be made based on whether `other` falls within the specified business hours. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business days and remaining business hours also needs to be carefully validated.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n >= 0 and bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                elif n < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues identified and ensures that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are based on the correct conditions and business hour offsets.
