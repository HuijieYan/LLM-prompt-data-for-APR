### Analysis
1. The function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on the business hours specified by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function adjusts the `other` datetime according to the business hours but has some logical errors that result in incorrect adjustments.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the business hours and improper handling of the adjustment logic.
4. The bug can be fixed by correcting the calculation of business hours, adjusting the logic for different cases, and ensuring the adjustments are made correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the calculation of total business hours per day by ensuring it correctly sums up the business hours covered by each interval.
2. Rework the adjustment logic to accurately handle the cases where `n` (number of business hours to adjust) is positive or negative.
3. Ensure that the adjustment process correctly considers business days as well as remaining business hours to adjust.

This fixed version addresses the calculation of business hours, adjustment logic, and correct handling of remaining hours. It should now pass all the provided test cases successfully.
