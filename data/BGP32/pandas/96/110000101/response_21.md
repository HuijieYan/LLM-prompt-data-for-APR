### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs due to the incorrect adjustment of the input `other` datetime when the value of `n` is negative. This leads to incorrect calculations and results in the function failing to accurately adjust the business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable are consistent and accurate, especially when `n` is negative. Additionally, we need to verify the calculations related to business hours and adjust the datetime accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        while r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60 or (r == bhour.total_seconds() // 60 and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected version of the function provided above should now accurately adjust the given datetime based on the business hours specified, considering both positive and negative values of `n`.
