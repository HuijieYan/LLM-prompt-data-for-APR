### Bug Analysis:
In the provided code, the buggy function is attempting to adjust a given datetime `other` based on business hour intervals specified by the class attributes. However, there are multiple potential error locations that could result in incorrect adjustments:
1. Converting `other` to a new datetime object with only the date and time components, potentially losing timezone information.
2. Incorrect adjustment of `other` based on the given business hour intervals.
3. Incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Preserve the original timezone information of `other` to avoid losing it during the datetime conversion.
2. Ensure accurate adjustments of `other` based on business hour intervals and handle edge cases correctly.
3. Accurately calculate business days and remaining business hours for correct adjustment.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code addresses the potential bugs by correctly adjusting the `other` datetime based on business hour intervals, preserving the timezone information, and accurately calculating business days and remaining business hours for correct adjustments.
