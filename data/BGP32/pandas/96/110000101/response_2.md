### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to calculate adjusted datetime values based on business hours and days. The function takes a datetime object as input and performs various adjustments based on the business hours, days, and holidays defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

### Error Locations
1. The function manipulates the `other` datetime object directly, which can cause unexpected changes.
2. In the calculation of business hours and adjustments, there might be inconsistencies leading to incorrect results.
3. Comparing time values directly may not work as expected due to minute-level granularity differences.
4. Handling negative business hours may not be properly managed.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely occurs in scenarios where the adjustment needs to consider both positive and negative business hours and multiple time intervals within a business day. The improper handling of these cases may result in incorrect datetime adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Avoid directly manipulating the original datetime object.
2. Ensure that adjustments are correctly made for positive and negative business hours following the defined business hours and holidays.
3. Use appropriate comparisons and calculations to handle adjustments within time intervals accurately.
4. Implement logic to handle negative business hours appropriately.
5. Consider cases where adjustments may span multiple business time intervals.

### Corrected Version
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            adjusted_time = self._adjust_datetime(other, n, businesshours)
            
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _adjust_datetime(self, other, n, businesshours):
        adjusted_time = other
        is_negative = n < 0
        
        while n != 0:
            if is_negative:
                adjusted_time = self._adjust_negative_time(adjusted_time, businesshours)
                n += 1
            else:
                adjusted_time = self._adjust_positive_time(adjusted_time, businesshours)
                n -= 1
        
        return adjusted_time
    
    def _adjust_negative_time(self, time, businesshours):
        businessday = BusinessDay(n=-1)
        adjusted_time = time - businessday
        
        while not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
            adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
            adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
        
        return adjusted_time

    def _adjust_positive_time(self, time, businesshours):
        opened_time = self._next_opening_time(time)
        remaining_hours = businesshours - (time - opened_time).seconds
        
        while remaining_hours > 0:
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opened_time)
            time_in_interval = min(remaining_hours, (closing_time - opened_time).seconds)
            opened_time += timedelta(seconds=time_in_interval)
            remaining_hours -= time_in_interval
        
        return opened_time
```

This corrected version splits the adjustment logic into separate methods for handling positive and negative business hours. It also uses a more systematic approach to iteratively adjust the datetime object, taking into account multiple intervals and ensuring correct adjustments for both positive and negative business hour scenarios.
