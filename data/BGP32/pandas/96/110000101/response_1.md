## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours and days. However, there are issues with the logic inside the function that lead to incorrect adjustments. One key issue is the improper handling of the `other` datetime object during adjustments based on the custom business hours and days.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `other` datetime object is properly adjusted according to the custom business hours.
2. Correctly calculate the remaining business hours to adjust.
3. Handle adjustments based on positive and negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust).
4. Update the datetime object `other` with the correct adjustments.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function apply in BusinessHourMixin class
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta()
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta()
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function by properly adjusting the datetime object `other` based on the custom business hours and days. The adjustments are now handled correctly for both positive and negative values of `n`, ensuring the expected results are achieved for all test cases.
