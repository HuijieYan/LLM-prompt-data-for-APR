The bug in the provided function lies in the calculation of business days adjustment and business hours adjustment. The function is not correctly handling the cases where the adjustment time spans multiple days. Additionally, there are issues with adjusting the remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and business hours separately, ensuring accurate adjustments for positive and negative values of `self.n`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The correct version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for positive business days
            businessdays = n // len(self.weekmask)
            weekdays = (self.weekmask * businessdays)
            target_day = other + timedelta(days=businessdays)
            while not all(day in weekdays for day in [target_day.weekday(), self.next_bday.apply(target_day).weekday()]):
                target_day += timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            # Adjust for negative business days
            businessdays = (-n) // len(self.weekmask)
            weekdays = (self.weekmask * businessdays)[::-1]
            target_day = other - timedelta(days=businessdays)
            while not all(day in weekdays for day in [target_day.weekday(), self.next_bday.apply(target_day).weekday()]):
                target_day -= timedelta(days=1)
                
        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        remaining_minutes = n % len(self.weekmask) * 60
        target_time = datetime.combine(target_day, other.time())
        
        while remaining_minutes > 0:
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(target_time)
            time_diff = closing_time - target_time
            if remaining_minutes >= time_diff.seconds // 60:
                target_time = closing_time
                remaining_minutes -= time_diff.seconds // 60
            else:
                target_time += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                remaining_minutes = 0
        
        return target_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts business days and business hours in separate steps, taking into account both positive and negative values of `self.n`. It correctly handles cases where the adjustment extends over multiple days and ensures accurate adjustment of business hours.
