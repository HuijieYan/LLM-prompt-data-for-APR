### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current function arises due to the improper adjustment of the input 'other' datetime object based on the value of 'n'. This leads to incorrect calculations and adjustments that result in wrong output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the 'other' datetime object correctly based on whether 'n' is positive or negative, and then proceed with the business hour adjustments as intended.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected function ensures that the datetime adjustments are done correctly based on the value of 'n' and handles the business hour offsets as needed.
