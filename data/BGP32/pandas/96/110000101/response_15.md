## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `apply` function because it fails to correctly adjust the time when the value of `n` is negative, resulting in incorrect calculations and returning the wrong value.

The bug stems from the logic inside the `if n < 0` block, where it initially checks if `other.time()` is in `self.start` set. If it is, it moves `other` to the previous day by subtracting one second. However, in the subsequent logic, when it tries to check if `other` is not on offset, it fails to consider the case where `other` is still in the previous day after the subtraction.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for adjusting the time when `n` is negative. Specifically, we need to ensure that after moving `other` to the previous day, we handle the case where it is still not on offset correctly. One way to achieve this is to adjust the logic to properly handle this edge case and ensure the correct adjustment of the time.

## Corrected Code
