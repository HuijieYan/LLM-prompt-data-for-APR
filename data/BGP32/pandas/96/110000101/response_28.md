### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has errors related to adjusting dates and times based on business hours. It fails to properly calculate the adjusted time for given business hours and days.

### Error locations:
1. Inconsistent handling of conditions for positive and negative business hours.
2. Incorrect adjustment of business days.
3. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours.

### Bug cause:
The function fails to accurately adjust the given datetime based on the business hours and days. It struggles with calculating the correct number of business days to skip, adjusting the remaining hours, and accurately moving between business time intervals.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Improve the logic for adjusting positive and negative business hours.
2. Correctly adjust the datetime based on the number of business days to skip.
3. Fix the calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours to ensure accurate results.

This corrected version corrects the bugs related to adjusting business hours and days, ensuring the function returns the expected results for all given cases.
