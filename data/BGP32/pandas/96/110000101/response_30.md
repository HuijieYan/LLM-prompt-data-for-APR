### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given input datetime based on custom business hours. It calculates the business hours between start and end times, adjusts for business days, and then adjusts for remaining business hours.

### Bugs:
1. The function is not handling the case when `other` is a Timestamp object from Pandas. It needs to utilize appropriate methods to handle the Timestamp object.
2. The adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours seems incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the Pandas Timestamp object `other` to a regular datetime object for easier manipulation.
2. Correct the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.

### Code Fix:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                # adjust by business days first
                other = self._adjust_business_days(other, bd)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    other, bhour_remain = self._adjust_remaining_hours_positive(other, bhour_remain)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    other, bhour_remain = self._adjust_remaining_hours_negative(other, bhour_remain)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the fixed version, the function now properly converts a Pandas Timestamp object to a regular datetime object for manipulation. It also corrects the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate results.
