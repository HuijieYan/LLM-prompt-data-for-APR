### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given timestamp. The function is encountering issues while adjusting the timestamp based on the custom business hours.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the test execution when the function tries to validate the frequency. This error occurs due to incorrect adjustments made to the timestamp within the `apply` function.

### Issues:
1. The adjustment logic for negative business hours (`n < 0`) in the function needs improvement.
2. Errors might occur when adjusting the timestamp based on business days and business hours.
3. Handling of non-fixed frequencies is causing issues during validation.

### Suggestions for Fix:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of timestamp based on the given custom business hours.
2. Enhance the logic for handling negative business hours and edge cases.
3. Address the frequency validation issue to prevent the `ValueError` during testing.

### Proposed Fix for the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the issues and ensure proper adjustment of timestamps based on the custom business hours.
