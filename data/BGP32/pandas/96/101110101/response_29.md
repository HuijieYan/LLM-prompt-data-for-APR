The buggy function has an issue that leads to incorrect calculations and raises a ValueError during execution. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business hours and handling of skips in the business days.

The main problem arises from how the function handles the adjustment of the timestamp `other` when applying the custom business hours. It fails to correctly adjust for negative business days (`n < 0`) and doesn't handle the case where the time is on the offset correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative business days are correctly handled, and that the offset time is taken into account when adjusting the time intervals.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = skip_bd._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(minutes=(r - bhour.total_seconds() // 60))
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(minutes=(r - bhour.total_seconds() // 60))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By addressing the issues mentioned above in the corrected code, the function should now handle the adjustments correctly and pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
