## Bug analysis:
The bug lies in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is not correctly adjusting the datetime input based on the CustomBusinessHour attributes. As a result, the function fails to calculate the correct output datetime values in certain cases.

The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the expected frequency (`CBH`) due to incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function.

## Bug fix strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the CustomBusinessHour attributes and adjust the input datetime accordingly.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative business hours are correctly implemented.
3. Make sure to handle cases where the input datetime is on a holiday or outside the business hours.
4. Update the calculation logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours.

## Bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            business_hours_sec = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            adjust_func = self._next_opening_time if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = adjust_func(other) - other
                if (n >= 0 and bhour_remain < bhour) or (n < 0 and (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0))):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = adjust_func(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these fixes, the `apply` function should be able to handle the CustomBusinessHour adjustments correctly and pass the failing test successfully.
