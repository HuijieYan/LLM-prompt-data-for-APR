### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the input `other` datetime value based on the provided `CustomBusinessHour` settings. The bug leads to incorrect calculations and an inconsistency between the expected behavior and the actual output. The failing test case provides inputs that result in an error due to the incorrect functioning of the `apply` method.

#### Error
The current implementation of the `apply` function is not calculating the new datetime values according to the business hours as defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. This error results in the failing test case as the expected outputs are not being generated correctly.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input `other` datetime value are in line with the defined business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. Correcting the calculation logic and ensuring proper adjustments based on the business hours should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            current_time = other.time()
            
            if n >= 0:
                # Check if the current time falls on closing time or not on offset
                if current_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Check if the current time is on starting time, then adjust to the previous business day
                if current_time in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the fix, the corrected `apply` function should correctly adjust the input `other` datetime value according to the specified `CustomBusinessHour` settings.
