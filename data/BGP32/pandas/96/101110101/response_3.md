The bug in the provided function is causing it to fail the test due to incorrect handling when adjusting business hours based on the input datetime object. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function that applies business hours correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import time

class CustomBusinessHour:
    def __init__(self, start, holidays):
        self.start = time(*(int(x) for x in start.split(':'))
        self.holidays = holidays

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset the timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=0)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n > 0:
                if self.is_on_offset(other) and other.weekday() < 5 and other not in self.holidays:
                    n -= 1
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if self.is_on_offset(other) and other.weekday() < 5 and other not in self.holidays:
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases provided.
