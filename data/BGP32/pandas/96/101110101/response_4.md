## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to apply the CustomBusinessHour offset to a given datetime object and return the adjusted datetime. However, the failing test indicates that the function is not properly adjusting the datetime based on the business hour constraints.

The function seems to have issues with adjusting the datetime when the CustomBusinessHour offset requires moving to the next business day or dealing with business hours within the same day.

## Issues
1. The logic to handle negative business hours (moving to the previous business day) is incorrect.
2. Adjustments to move to the next business day or handle remaining business hours are flawed.

## Solution Strategy
1. Fix the logic for handling negative business hours to properly move to the previous business day.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours within the same day.

## Code Correction

```python
# Fix the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if n >= 0:
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break  # Break the loop if adjustment is completed
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and not self.is_on_offset(other, before=True)):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break  # Break the loop if adjustment is completed
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the logic for handling negative business hours and correctly adjusting the remaining business hours within the same day, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
