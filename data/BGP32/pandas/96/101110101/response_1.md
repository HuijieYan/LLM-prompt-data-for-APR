### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The incorrect behavior comes from the incorrect handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the function. The bug causes the `DatetimeArray` validation to fail during specific frequency checks in the test function, leading to a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Identify and correct the calculation errors in adjusting the business hours.
- Ensure proper handling of `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to align with the expected behavior.
- Adjust the code logic to correctly calculate the adjusted datetime according to the business hour offsets.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.core.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHourMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CustomBusinessHourMixin(BusinessHourMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
                businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r

                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd

                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency and pass the failing test case provided.
