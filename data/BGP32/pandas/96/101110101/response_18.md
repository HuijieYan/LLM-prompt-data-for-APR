The bug in the `apply` method is causing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail with a `ValueError`. The error originates from a validation check inside the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Analysis:
1. The `apply` method is expecting an input of type `datetime`, but when `pd.date_range` is called with a custom frequency `CustomBusinessHour`, the `Timestamp` object passed is not converted to a `datetime` object, leading to mismatches during the frequency validation.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` method handles the input `other` specifically when it's a `Timestamp` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `apply` method to properly handle `Timestamp` objects and convert them to `datetime` objects before performing the internal calculations.
- Ensure that the time and date components are correctly preserved during the conversion.

### Updated `apply` method:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
        elif hasattr(other, "to_pydatetime"):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
            
            # Adjust timezone to local time
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        # include the following code lines to maintain timezone during conversion
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=other.tzinfo)
        
        # remaining code remains the same
```

Applying the proposed fix to the `apply` method should resolve the `ValueError` issue and make the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass successfully.
