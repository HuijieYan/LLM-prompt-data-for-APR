### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified by the instance of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. However, there are issues in handling the adjustment for positive and negative business hours. This leads to incorrect adjustments and causes the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made in the function are correctly handling positive and negative business hours.
2. Confirm that the adjustments are made within the specified business hours based on the `start` and `end` times in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the issues described above:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=self.end[0].minute)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # calculate total business hours per day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # calculate business days and remaining hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # adjust remaining business hours
            while r != 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if n >= 0:
                    if next_opening.hour == self.end[0].hour:
                        break
                    current_duration = (next_opening - other).seconds // 60
                    if r >= current_duration:
                        r -= current_duration
                        other = next_opening
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                else:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    current_duration = (closing_time - other).seconds // 60
                    if r >= current_duration:
                        other = closing_time
                        r -= current_duration
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this bug fix, the failing test should pass, and the corrected function now properly adjusts the datetime based on positive and negative business hours while respecting the specified business hours.
