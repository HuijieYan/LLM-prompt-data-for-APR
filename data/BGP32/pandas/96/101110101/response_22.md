### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `apply` function arises from improper handling of the provided `other` parameter when it is a `datetime` object. The function is designed to adjust the input datetime based on business hours, holidays, and weekends. However, the logic within the function has several issues that lead to incorrect results and the failing test.

1. The function fails to properly adjust the input datetime based on the provided business hours and specific conditions related to offset timings.
2. In some cases, the function moves the datetime to the next opening time but fails to accurately determine the closing time.
3. There are inconsistencies in adjusting the business days and remaining business hours which result in incorrect calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to focus on properly adjusting the input datetime considering the business hours, holidays, weekends, and other offset-specific conditions. Specifically, we should ensure that:
- The datetime adjustments are made accurately based on the next opening time, closing time, and other related factors.
- Business days are correctly handled, especially when moving the datetime to the next business day.
- Remaining business hours are calculated and adjusted appropriately without errors.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # Adjust the input datetime based on the offset
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours per day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Adjust per business days first
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Handle remaining business hours adjustments
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the suggested fixes, the corrected `apply` function should now handle the input datetimes properly and adjust them according to business hours, holidays, and offset conditions effectively. This correction should resolve the failing test case and ensure the expected behavior of the function for all provided cases.
