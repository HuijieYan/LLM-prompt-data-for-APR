### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is failing because of incorrect adjustments made to the `other` timestamp when applying the business hours offset. The logic inside the function is not handling the cases where the `other` timestamp falls on the start or end times of the business hours range properly. This leads to incorrect adjustments and an incorrect final result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Properly handle the cases where the `other` timestamp falls on the start or end times of the business hours range.
2. Ensure that the adjustments to move to the next business opening time and closing time are done correctly.
3. Check the logic related to checking the weekday and holidays to ensure proper offsets are applied.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# fix the buggy function here
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Remove timezone information
        
        # Find the closest opening time
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Adjust for non-business day
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test cases.
