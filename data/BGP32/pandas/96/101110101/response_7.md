The buggy function is failing to handle the custom business hours correctly, resulting in an error related to frequency validation. The main issue seems to be with how the function is adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the custom business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly adjust the `other` datetime object by considering the custom business hours defined in the `self` object. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct business days and business hours are calculated for the given input.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Calculate the start of business day time
            start_of_day = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0, 0)

            # Find the next business hour when the business opens
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(start_of_day)
            
            # Adjust other to the start of business day
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                next_opening.hour,
                next_opening.minute,
                next_opening.second,
                next_opening.microsecond,
            )

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the `other` datetime object in a way that respects the custom business hours. It iterates over the business hours based on the value of `n` and adjusts the time accordingly. This approach should fix the frequency validation error and handle the custom business hours correctly.

Make sure to test this corrected version with the failing test case to verify that it behaves as expected.
