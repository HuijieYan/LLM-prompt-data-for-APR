## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours, but due to incorrect logic, it fails to perform the adjustment accurately, leading to incorrect outputs. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjusting the timestamp accordingly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic in the `apply` method. Some key areas to focus on are how business hours are calculated, how the adjustment is handled for different cases of positive and negative business hours, and how the timestamp is updated during the adjustment process. We need to ensure that the correct business hours are calculated, the adjustment is applied accurately, and the final timestamp is returned correctly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay

# The corrected method
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        while bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=1 if bd > 0 else -1)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
            bd -= 1 if bd > 0 else -1

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the logic issues in the `apply` method and should fix the bug that caused incorrect adjustments of timestamps based on business hours.
