## Bug Analysis:
The `apply` function is designed to apply the custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. However, the current implementation contains a bug that leads to incorrect handling of the offset calculation, resulting in the failure of the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The bug arises from the incorrect assignment of the `nanosecond` variable, which is used to obtain the nanosecond value from the input `other` datetime object. Due to this incorrect assignment, the `other` datetime object loses its nanosecond information, leading to errors in the subsequent calculations within the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the assignment of the nanosecond value needs to be corrected to maintain the original nanosecond information in the datetime object. By ensuring that the nanosecond value is preserved during the processing, the function should work correctly and produce the expected output.

## Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # preserve nanosecond before resetting the datetime object
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = other.replace(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other.replace(nanosecond=nanosecond)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the assignment of the nanosecond value and ensuring that it is correctly preserved during the datetime object manipulations, the corrected `apply` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.
