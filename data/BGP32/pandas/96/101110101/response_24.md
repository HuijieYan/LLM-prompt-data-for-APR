The buggy function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime values when applying business hours. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.

From the failing test case provided, it seems that the calculated values are not aligning with the expected values for the datetime index being generated. This discrepancy is likely due to errors in the adjustment calculations within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully review the adjustment logic for business days and the remaining business hours within the `apply` function. We should also ensure that the adjustments maintain the correct datetime format and align with the expected output values specified in the test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                before = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining = other - before
                other = before + skip_bd + remaining
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            current_business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time(), self.end[other.weekday()])
            bhour = datetime.combine(date.today(), self.end[other.weekday()]) - other
            if bhour_remain.total_seconds() < bhour.total_seconds():
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments for business days and remaining business hours have been carefully revised to ensure they align with the expected output values specified in the test cases.

Make sure to test this corrected version with the failing test case provided to verify that the bug has been successfully fixed and the function now produces the expected results.
