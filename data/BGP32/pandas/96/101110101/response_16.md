### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is not properly adjusting the business hours when applying a `CustomBusinessHour` offset to a datetime object. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the time value falls within or outside the business hours specified.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This suggests that the adjustments made by the `apply` function are incorrect, leading to unexpected frequencies.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the logic that adjusts the `other` datetime object based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Bug Cause:
1. The adjustment of the `other` datetime object is not accounting for all edge conditions correctly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The application of business hours by seconds in one business day is not being calculated accurately, leading to deviations in the final adjusted datetime object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure proper handling of edge cases and accurate adjustment of business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while other.time() != self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the `apply` function should be able to properly adjust the datetime object based on the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, resulting in correct frequencies and passing the failing test cases.
