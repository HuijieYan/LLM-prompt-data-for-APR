Based on the information provided, the bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` object and the date adjustment logic. The function is not properly adjusting the date according to the business hours when combined with custom holidays and start times.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` time should be revised to ensure that it aligns with the specified business hours. Additionally, the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` object should be consistent throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply method
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if getattr(other, "freq", None) is not None and other.freq.freqstr == "CBH":
            other = other.round("H")
            n = self.n

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    next_start = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                    while not self.is_on_offset(next_start):
                        next_start = self._next_opening_time(next_start)
                    other = next_start
                else:
                    while other in self or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                n = np.sign(n) * (abs(n) - 1)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should now handle the adjustment of the input date `other` according to the specified business hours given by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
