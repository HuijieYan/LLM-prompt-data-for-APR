### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class due to improper handling of business hours when adjusting the date and time. The bug results in incorrect adjustments to the input datetime based on the given business hours configuration.

The buggy function does not handle the edge case of adjustments correctly when the business hours extend beyond the working hours of the day. This results in incorrect calculations that lead to the function returning inaccurate datetime values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the specified business hours. It is crucial to ensure that the adjustments consider all edge cases and correctly advance or move back the datetime based on the business hours configuration.

### The Corrected Function

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            idx = pd.DatetimeIndex([other])
            idx.freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0])

            return idx.shift(self.n)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made
1. Adjusted the code to properly handle the case where the input datetime is before the start of business hours.
2. Updated the logic to correctly determine if adjustments are needed based on the specified business hours.
3. Created a new DatetimeIndex `idx` with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and used it to shift the datetime by `self.n` periods.

With these changes, the corrected function should address the bug in the original implementation and pass the failing test cases.
