### 1. Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is used for adjusting a given datetime object based on business hours within a specific frequency. The error message provided is related to a failure in validating the frequency against the date range created with a custom business hour frequency.

### 2. Potential error locations:
- The bug might be related to how the custom business hour frequency is being handled.
- The problem could arise from incorrect adjustment of the datetime object within business hours.
- Issues might be present in the way the business days are being handled in the adjustment process.
- There could be inaccuracies in the calculations of business hours.
- Exception handling and error message generation need to be properly handled for better error reporting.

### 3. Cause of the bug:
The error message states that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH". This indicates a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, which raises a `ValueError`.

### 4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed custom business hour frequency. Review how the custom business hour frequency is processed, adjust the datetime object within business hours correctly, handle business days accurately, and validate the calculations for business hours.

### 5. Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other accordingly
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues related to the custom business hour frequency validation and ensure proper adjustment of the datetime objects within business hours.
