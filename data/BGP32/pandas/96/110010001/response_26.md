### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object according to business hours and other related parameters. The error message indicates a failure related to frequency validation when working with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic related to adjusting the business days and hours might not be working correctly.
2. There could be an issue with the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object based on business hours and days, resulting in an inaccurate output. Additionally, the frequency validation check with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency seems to be failing, leading to the ValueError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct calculations for adjusting business hours and days.
2. Verify the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency validation to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                other = self.apply_offsets(other, n)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def apply_offsets(self, timestamp, n):
            # Business Hour calculations
            businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # Adjust to move to the nearest business day
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(timestamp):
                    timestamp = self._next_opening_time(timestamp)
                timestamp += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                time_interval = self._prev_opening_time(timestamp) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(timestamp)
                bhour = coffee_hrs_interval - timestamp
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    timestamp += bhour_remain
                    break
                
                timestamp = self._next_opening_time(time_interval)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

            return timestamp

```

### Updated Explanation:
- The `apply` method now calls a separate helper method `apply_offsets` to perform the business day and hour adjustments.
- The `apply_offsets` method calculates the necessary adjustments based on the input `datetime` object and the provided number of business hours.
- Inside the `apply_offsets` method, we make sure to adjust the datetime object accurately based on business hours and days.

By separating the logic into a helper method, we can ensure more clarity and accuracy in the adjustments made to the input datetime object.
