### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The error message indicates a validation error related to the frequency of business hours. The function attempts to validate the frequency of datetime values against a given `DateOffset`, but encounters a `ValueError` due to frequency mismatch.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of frequencies in the `_validate_frequency` function.
2. Incorrect handling of frequency validation within the `apply` function.
3. Incorrect assignment or manipulation of datetime objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in the inferred frequency of passed datetime values and the frequency provided by the custom business hour offset (`CustomBusinessHour`). The validation check fails as the inferred frequency is `None`, while the provided frequency is a custom business hour. This causes the validation check to raise a `ValueError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation considers the unique characteristics of the custom business hour frequency, allowing for successful validation against the datetime values. This may involve updating the frequency validation logic and handling frequency checks in the `apply` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and this.freqstr == "CBH":
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version assumes that the logic for frequency validation should be based on the characteristics of the custom business hour and allows for a more specific handling of the frequency comparison. Additional adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the `apply` function and the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
