### Analysis:
1. The provided function `apply` is a method within the class `BusinessHourMixin`. It attempts to adjust a `datetime` object based on a business hour offset.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation for a `DatetimeArray`.
3. The bug seems to be related to frequency validation when generating a date range with custom business hours.
4. The bug is likely due to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency (`CBH` in this case).
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency during validation.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Implementation code remains the same

            freqstr = str(self)
            if inferred and inferred != freqstr:
                raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} does not match passed frequency {freqstr}")

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This fix ensures that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency before generating a date range with custom business hours.
