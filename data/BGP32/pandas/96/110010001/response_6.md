### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply()` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is designed to calculate the next business hour based on a given datetime input. The error message is coming from a failing test that is validating the frequency of a CustomBusinessHour object.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be related to frequency validation and the comparison of inferred frequency with the frequency passed in. Specifically, the code is failing at the point where a ValueError is raised due to frequency mismatch.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the inferred frequency (None) from the passed values does not match the passed frequency (CBH) in the failing test. This leads to a ValueError being raised when trying to validate the frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency during frequency validation. This involves setting the correct inferred frequency in the `apply()` function based on the given datetime input.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        ...
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            inferred_freq = self.get_inferred_freq()  # Get inferred frequency based on business hours
            if inferred_freq is None:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Inferred frequency is None. Unable to determine appropriate frequency.")
    
            # validate that frequency matches the inferred frequency
            if self.freq.freqstr != inferred_freq.freqstr:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Passed frequency does not match inferred frequency.")
    
            # Rest of the function remains the same
            ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a call to `self.get_inferred_freq()` to determine the inferred frequency based on the business hours. Then we compare the inferred frequency with the passed frequency to ensure they match. If not, we raise an appropriate error. This should fix the bug related to frequency validation.
