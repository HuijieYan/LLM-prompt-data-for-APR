1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The error message is indicating a ValueError related to frequency validation not conforming to the expected frequency.

2. Potential error locations within the function could be the logic around adjusting the business days and business hours based on the given input `other` datetime object.

3. The bug arises from the incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object in the `apply` function. This incorrect adjustment causes the resulting frequency to not conform to the expected frequency, leading to the ValueError during validation.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object maintain the correct frequency according to the given business hours and business days. It's essential to adjust the datetime object properly to align with the custom business hour frequency.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            if n < 0:
                other = self._get_prev_opening_or_closing_time(other, backward=True)
            else:
                other = self._get_next_opening_or_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic has been simplified to ensure that the `other` datetime object is properly aligned with the custom business hour frequency. The adjustments for business days and business hours have been modified to maintain the correct frequency, addressing the ValueError issue during validation.
