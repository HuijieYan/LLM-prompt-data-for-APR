### Analysis:
The error message indicates a ValueError occurring during the validation of frequency with a CustomBusinessHour in the DatetimeArray. The error is related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The CustomBusinessHour offset handling may be causing the frequency validation error.
2. The apply function in the BusinessHourMixin class could have incorrect handling.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may stem from inconsistency between the inferred frequency and the CustomBusinessHour frequency, possibly due to incorrect adjustments or validations in the apply function within the BusinessHourMixin class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made in the apply function are compatible with the CustomBusinessHour frequency to avoid the validation error.
2. Validate the frequency in a way that matches the CustomBusinessHour properties.
3. Consider adjusting the logic within the apply function to correctly handle the business hours and offsets.

### Corrected Version of the apply Function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not hasattr(other, "nanosecond"):
                nanosecond = 0
            else:
                nanosecond = other.nanosecond
            
            n = self.n

                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
            else:
                if adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_time = adjusted_time - timedelta(seconds=1)

            business_days_workdays, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)

            if business_days_workdays != 0:
                skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days_workdays)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    remaining_time = adjusted_time - prev_opening
                    adjusted_time = prev_opening + skip_business_days + remaining_time
                else:
                    adjusted_time += skip_business_days
            
            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time))
                    business_hours_left = closing_time - adjusted_time
                    if remaining_hours < business_hours_left:
                        adjusted_time += remaining_hours
                        remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= business_hours_left
                        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + business_hours_left)
                else:
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    business_hours_left = opening_time - adjusted_time
                    if remaining_hours > business_hours_left or (remaining_hours == business_hours_left and nanosecond != 0):
                        adjusted_time += remaining_hours
                        remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= business_hours_left
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + business_hours_left - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues in the original code related to the frequency validation error. It ensures the adjustments made are compatible with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and properly handles the business hours and offsets.
