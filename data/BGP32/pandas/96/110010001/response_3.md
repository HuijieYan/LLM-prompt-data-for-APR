### Analysis:
The error occurs during the validation of the frequency of a CustomBusinessHour with a DatetimeIndex. The bug is likely in the apply method of the BusinessHourMixin class, where some adjustments are made to a datetime object based on business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the adjustments to the datetime object are handled in the apply method. The adjustments may result in a frequency that does not conform to the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency, triggering a ValueError during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object do not create a frequency mismatch with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
2. Adjust the logic in the apply method to maintain the integrity of the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Copy the original datetime to avoid modifying the timezone
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the datetime based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring that the adjustments made in the apply method preserve the frequency compatibility with the CustomBusinessHour frequency, we can avoid the ValueError during frequency validation in the subsequent steps.
