1. The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is meant to handle business hours' calculations and adjustments. The function is supposed to accept a datetime object and adjust it according to the business hours specified by the mixin.

2. Potential error locations within the `apply` function include the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours, calculations of business days, and adjustments of remaining business hours.

3. The bug in the function seems to be related to the validation of frequency compatibility, which is indirectly triggered by the adjustments made within the `apply` function. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, specifically mentioning a CustomBusinessHour frequency.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function do not cause conflicts with frequency validation, specifically when working with CustomBusinessHour frequency.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
     
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
     
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
     
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
     
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
     
            if r != 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if n >= 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        if bhour_remain < bhour:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                        if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
     
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function aims to ensure that the adjustments made operate smoothly without interfering with the frequency validation, which should resolve the error message encountered in the failing test.
