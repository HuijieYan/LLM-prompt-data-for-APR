### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is intended to apply the business hour offset to a given datetime, adjusting it based on the business hours and opening times.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring during a frequency validation check in a different part of the code (`_validate_frequency` method) when working with a Custom Business Hour frequency (`CBH`).

### Identified Issue:
The issue seems to be related to the frequency comparison failing due to an incorrect or missing inferred frequency. This error likely occurs when using Custom Business Hour frequency, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency is correctly determined and provided during the frequency validation process. We should make sure that the Custom Business Hour frequency is correctly handled and compared to avoid the `ValueError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHourMixin

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Adjust business hours, business days, and remaining hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            remain = other
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open
            other = other + skip_bd + remain

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            other = self._adjust_remaining_hours(other, bhour_remain)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _adjust_remaining_hours(self, other, bhour_remain):
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        return other
```

In the corrected version, I added a method `_adjust_remaining_hours` to handle the adjustment of remaining business hours, improving readability and reducing repetition. Additionally, I made adjustments to the logic for handling business days and remaining hours to align with the intended behavior.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test related to Custom Business Hour frequency.
