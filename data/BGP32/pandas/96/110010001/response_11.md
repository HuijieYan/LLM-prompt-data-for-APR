1. The buggy function `apply` belongs to the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin`. The purpose of this function is to apply a business time offset to a given datetime. The `apply` function checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`, then it performs various calculations to adjust the datetime based on business hours.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the calculation and adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on the business hours specified by the start and end times. The error message indicates a mismatch in frequencies.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of frequencies related to business hours. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency (Custom Business Hour in this case).

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequencies are handled correctly throughout the calculation process. This includes aligning the inferred frequency with the provided Custom Business Hour frequency and ensuring consistency in the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if n != 0:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic of the function, focusing on adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours specified by the `start` and `end` times. Ensure to test this corrected version to verify that it resolves the frequency mismatch issue.
