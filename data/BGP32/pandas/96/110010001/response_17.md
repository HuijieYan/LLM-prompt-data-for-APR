### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas` library is intended to adjust a datetime value based on business hours. The error message indicates a failure during validation of frequency in a datetime index, specifically related to custom business hours.

### Bug Identification:
The error message `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH` suggests that the frequency inferred from the passed datetime values is None, which does not match the passed custom business hour frequency (`CBH`). This discrepancy in frequency is causing the validation to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustment of datetime values within business hours, which leads to incorrect calculations and the inference of a None frequency. This incorrect behavior causes the validation to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic in the `apply` function to properly adjust datetime values within business hours. This correction should ensure that the inferred frequency matches the custom business hour frequency passed to it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other_dt = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:  # Adjust by business days first
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other_dt):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other_dt)
                    remain = other_dt - prev_open
                    other_dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other_dt = other_dt + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other_dt)) - other_dt
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other_dt += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other_dt = self._next_opening_time(other_dt + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other_dt) - other_dt
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other_dt += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other_dt + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function ensures that the adjustments to the datetime value are done correctly within the specified business hours, addressing the frequency validation issue observed in the failing test.
