### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring during validation of a frequency for a Datetime Array.
- The bug seems to be related to frequency validation when using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `apply` function, which is not handling the frequency correctly, leading to a mismatch during the validation step.
- The specific error is related to the non-conformance of the inferred frequency to the passed frequency in the `CustomBusinessHour` case.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to incorrect handling of frequencies during the application of a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to datetime values within the `apply` function.
- The function is not aligning the expected frequency with the provided `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, leading to a validation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the frequency manipulation within the `apply` function aligns with the expected behavior for a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
- Adjust the frequency handling to match the behavior of a custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                return super().apply(other)
            
            if not self._is_valid_business_hour():
                raise ApplyTypeError("Not a valid business hour offset.")

            if self._has_valid_offset(other):
                return self._next_opening_time(self._get_offset_adjusted_time(other))
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Time not on a valid business hour offset.")

        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we first handle the case of a generic business hour offset, and if it is a `CustomBusinessHour` object, we apply custom handling specific to that type of offset.
- We check the validity of the business hour offset and adjust the time accordingly based on the opening time and the adjusted time.
- We ensure that the frequency validation aligns with the expected behavior for a custom business hour frequency.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the application of custom business hour frequencies correctly, resolving the `ValueError` during frequency validation.
