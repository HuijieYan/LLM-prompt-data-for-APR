### Analysis:
The error message indicates a problem related to frequency validation when using a custom business hour offset. The error occurs in the `_validate_frequency` method, but it is triggered by the code calling the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency. The problem seems to be that the inferred frequency is `None`, but it does not conform to the custom business hour frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The frequency validation logic in the `_validate_frequency` method.
2. The custom business hour frequency generation or handling.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistency between the inferred frequency (None) and the custom business hour frequency passed to the `pd.date_range` function. This may be due to issues with how the custom business hour frequency is being handled in the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the inferred frequency is properly set when using a custom business hour offset. Additionally, we should make sure that the custom business hour frequency is correctly processed and validated against the inferred frequency in the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `BusinessHourMixin` class with the `apply` function fixed:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                return super().apply(other)
            
            n = self.n
            other = self._apply_n_business_hrs(other, n)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _apply_n_business_hrs(self, dt, n):
        businesshours = self._calculate_business_hours()
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        dt = self._adjust_by_business_days(dt, bd)
        dt = self._adjust_remaining_business_hours(dt, r)
        
        return dt
    
    def _calculate_business_hours(self):
        return sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    def _adjust_by_business_days(self, dt, bd):
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(dt):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
            remain = dt - prev_open
            dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            dt = dt + skip_bd
        return dt

    def _adjust_remaining_business_hours(self, dt, r):
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt) - dt
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                dt += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt + bhour)
        
        return dt
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the custom business hour logic is appropriately handled, and the application of business hours to a datetime object is done correctly based on the provided offset. This should fix the frequency validation issue observed in the failing test.
