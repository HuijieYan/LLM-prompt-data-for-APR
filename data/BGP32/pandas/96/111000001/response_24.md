The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic of adjusting the datetime object 'other' based on the business hours and number of business days as defined by the class. There are multiple conditional blocks that handle different scenarios, but there seems to be an issue in handling negative values for 'n' (number of business hours) and rounding errors when adjusting the business hours.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves revisiting the logic for adjusting the datetime object 'other' based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustment process is correct for both positive and negative values of 'n', and that the rounding errors are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(other) - other).total_seconds()
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= bhour:
                    other = next_open
                    bhour_remain -= timedelta(seconds=bhour)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = (other - prev_open).total_seconds()
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_open - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain -= timedelta(seconds=bhour)
                else:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, a while loop is used to handle the adjustment of remaining business hours 'bhour_remain' until the total seconds are reduced to 0. The logic inside the loop ensures correct adjustments for both positive and negative values of 'n'.
