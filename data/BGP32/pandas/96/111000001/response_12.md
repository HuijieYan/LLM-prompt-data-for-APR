The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the class attributes. The purpose is to ensure that the adjusted datetime falls within the business hours and respects the specified open and close times.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:

1. The calculation of business hours and adjustments based on positive or negative values of `n`.
2. Handling adjustments for business days.
3. Ensuring correct adjustment of remaining business hours within each time interval.

The cause of the bug arises from discrepancies in handling the adjustments based on the sign of `n`, which leads to incorrect adjustments and results. The function may fail to adjust the datetime properly within the specified business hours, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug:

1. Correct the adjustment logic based on whether `n` is positive or negative.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are handled accurately within each time interval.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other) - other
            adjust_time = min(bhour, bhour_remain)
            other += adjust_time
            bhour_remain -= adjust_time
            if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version improves the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, business days, and remaining business hours within each interval. It ensures that the adjustments are made accurately and that the datetime falls within the specified business hours.
