## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to calculate a new datetime value based on the business hours defined in the class. The function processes the input `other`, which is expected to be a datetime object. It adjusts this datetime object based on the defined business hours and business day offsets.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition after adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the end time and `_is_on_offset` function may not be handling all cases correctly.
2. Adjustment for negative values of `n` may not be effective in the section after the `else`.
3. Calculation of business hours and adjustments based on remaining time may have issues.
4. There might be cases where the calculations for business days and remaining business hours are not handled correctly.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the defined business hours and offsets. Specifically, the checks for positive and negative values of `n` along with the handling of business days and remaining business hours are flawed, leading to incorrect output datetime values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` to ensure correct adjustments are made.
2. Refactor the sections calculating business days and remaining business hours to handle edge cases correctly.
3. Improve the conditions for adjusting `other` datetime within business time intervals to cover all possible scenarios.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function above, adjustments have been made to properly handle business days, remaining business hours, and edge conditions. The logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object has been revised to provide the expected output based on the defined business hours and offsets.
