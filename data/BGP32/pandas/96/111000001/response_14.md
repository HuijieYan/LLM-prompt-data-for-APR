The bug in the provided function `apply` lies in the comparison of the `bhour_remain` with the business hour interval (`bhour`) when `n < 0`. Specifically, in the while loop where `bhour_remain != timedelta(0)`, the condition to determine whether to finish adjusting is flawed.

The buggy condition is:
```
if (
    bhour_remain > bhour
    or bhour_remain == bhour
    and nanosecond != 0
):
```

The issue with this condition is that it incorrectly includes the case where `bhour_remain` is equal to `bhour` and `nanosecond != 0`. This condition should only trigger when `bhour_remain > bhour`.

To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the condition needs to be adjusted to only consider the case where `bhour_remain > bhour`. By making this adjustment, we ensure that the adjustment logic works correctly for negative business days.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_time = other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug related to finishing the adjustment for negative business days should be resolved, and the function should work as intended.
