The bug in the provided code is related to the `skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)` line within the `apply` function. The `skip_bd` variable is being initialized with the `BusinessDay` class, but the class itself is not imported in the code snippet. Hence, the `BusinessDay` class is not defined in the current context, leading to a `NameError`.

To fix this bug, you need to import the `BusinessDay` class at the beginning of the file. If the `BusinessDay` class is defined in a different module, you should import it accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The corrected version of the function with the necessary import

# Importing the BusinessDay class from a hypothetical location
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding the import statement for the `BusinessDay` class, the issue related to the undefined class should be resolved, and the function should work correctly now.
