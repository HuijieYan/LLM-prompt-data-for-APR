## Analysis:
The buggy function seems to have issues related to the business hour calculation logic. It attempts to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours, but there are some errors in handling the calculations.

## Identified Bugs:
1. Incorrect handling of business days adjustment.
2. Incorrect logic when adjusting remaining business hours.
3. Inconsistencies in the adjustment process based on the sign of business hours.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bugs arise from miscalculations or misunderstandings in the way business days and business hours are adjusted in the function. The conditional logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive or negative business hours might not be correctly implemented.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for adjusting business days and business hours separately.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly made based on the sign of the business hours.
3. Simplify the code where possible to reduce complexity and potential for errors.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are separated and implemented based on the sign of the business hours. Simplifying the adjustment process helps in reducing redundant code and potential errors.
