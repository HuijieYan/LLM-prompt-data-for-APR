## Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to apply the business hour offsets to a given datetime object.
- The bug seems to be related to how the business hour offsets are applied to the input datetime.
- The function first checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`, then performs calculations based on the business hour offsets.

## Issues:
1. The calculation of business days offset (`bd`) is incorrect, leading to incorrect adjustments.
2. The loop for adjusting remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) based on the business time intervals has logic issues that may lead to incorrect outcomes.
3. There are inconsistencies in how the `other` datetime object is manipulated throughout the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the calculation of the business days offset (`bd`) to ensure it's correctly derived.
2. Adjust the logic within the loops for adjusting remaining business hours to accurately handle the adjustments and edge cases.
3. Review and correct how the `other` datetime object is manipulated based on the conditions in the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours / 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I've addressed the issues with the business days offset calculation, the logic for adjusting remaining business hours, and how the `other` datetime object is manipulated throughout the function, ensuring more accurate application of business hour offsets.
