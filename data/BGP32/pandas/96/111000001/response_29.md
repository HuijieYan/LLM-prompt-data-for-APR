The bug in the provided function is related to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime object based on the business hours. The issue occurs when adjusting the datetime object based on remaining business hours. Specifically, the bug arises due to the incorrect logic for adjusting the remaining business hours in both positive and negative direction.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                if n >= 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour_remain)
                    )
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- The loop that adjusts the remaining business hours has been modified to ensure the correct adjustment in both positive and negative directions.
- The condition for adjusting the remaining business hours now correctly evaluates if there are remaining business hours to adjust and adjusts them accordingly.

These changes should fix the bug in the function and ensure the datetime object is adjusted based on the business hour correctly.
