The bug in the provided function is related to the logic for adjusting the time when `n < 0`. The bug causes the function to fail to properly handle the case when `bhour_remain < bhour`, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the time when `n < 0` in the while loop. Instead of adjusting based on the next opening time, we should adjust based on the previous closing time to maintain the correct sequence of time intervals.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(
                            self._get_closing_time(other)
                        )
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to previous business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By updating the adjustment logic in the `while` loop for the case when `n < 0`, we ensure that the function adjusts the time correctly based on the previous closing time, thus fixing the bug.
