The buggy function has an issue where it fails to correctly adjust the time when the number of business hours to add or subtract is negative. This results in the incorrect calculation of the final time.

The bug occurs when `n < 0` inside the `apply` function. In this case, the function should subtract business hours from the given timestamp, but the calculations in the while loop are not handling this scenario correctly. The issue lies in how the remaining business hours are calculated and adjusted within the loop.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the while loop when `n < 0` to properly subtract the business hours from the timestamp and handle the edge cases where the given time may fall outside the business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
        
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
        
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
        
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open - skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other - skip_bd
        
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the function will now correctly handle negative business hours and adjust the timestamp accordingly.
