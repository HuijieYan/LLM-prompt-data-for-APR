The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect placement of the decorator `@apply_wraps`. The decorator `@apply_wraps` is intended to be used to wrap the `apply()` function with additional functionality when it is called. However, in the current implementation, the decorator is applied directly before the `apply()` function declaration, which is not the correct usage of the decorator.

To fix the bug:
1. Move the `@apply_wraps` decorator to wrap around the `apply()` function as it is being defined.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function with the decorator correctly placed:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the placement of the `@apply_wraps` decorator in the code, the function should now behave as intended without any bugs.
