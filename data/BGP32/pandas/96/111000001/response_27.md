The potential error in the buggy function lies in the incorrect calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime object based on the business day.

The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of negative business days (n < 0) and the adjustment of the datetime object accordingly. When the business day is negative, the logic to adjust the datetime object to the previous business day and find the closing time is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the datetime object for negative business days. Specifically, we need to ensure that the calculation for finding the previous opening time, adjusting to the previous business day, and then finding the closing time is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday(other) if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # Business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other) if n >= 0 \
                else (self._next_opening_time(other) - other)

            if n < 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour)

            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to negative business days and properly handles the adjustment of the datetime object based on the business day.
