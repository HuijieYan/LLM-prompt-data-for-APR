The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of the adjustment logic for business hours. The issue arises in the while loops where the adjustment of remaining business hours is done. The condition check for whether the adjustment is completed or not is inaccurate, leading to incorrect adjustment and potential infinite loops.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition checks inside the while loops to properly handle the adjustment of remaining business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic follows the correct paths for positive and negative business day adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # adjust for positive business hours
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            # adjust for negative business hours
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment logic and ensures that the adjustment is correctly handled for both positive and negative business hours. The while loop now adjusts the `other` datetime object based on the positive or negative values of `n` until the adjustment is completed.
