The potential bug in the given function `apply` lies in the adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on the business hours. There is a discrepancy in handling the cases where `n` is negative (moving to previous business day) and positive (moving to next business day).

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values. This may involve adjusting the logic in the while loops that handle the remaining business hours. Another potential fix could be to update the adjustment calculations based on the business hours remaining.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday(other) if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments have been made to ensure consistent handling of positive and negative `n` values, especially in the while loops for adjusting remaining business hours. Additionally, the logic for moving to the next or previous business day has been updated to ensure correctness.
