### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing to correctly adjust the datetime object based on the business hours. The function is responsible for applying a business offset to a datetime object, but it is not handling all cases correctly.

### Identified Issues:
1. The logic for adjusting the business hours is not correctly handling negative offsets.
2. Incorrect handling of business days when adjusting the datetime.
3. Potential issues with the loop logic for adjusting business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object based on the business hours offset, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. The incorrect handling of negative offsets, business days adjustment, and business hours adjustment contributes to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours offset.
2. Ensure proper handling of negative offsets and adjustment to business days.
3. Fix the loop logic for adjusting business hours in the datetime object.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        bd = n // self.businesshours
        r = n % self.businesshours
          
        if n < 0:
            if bd == 0:
                bd = -1
          
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
    
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issues with handling the business hours offset correctly and adjust the datetime object accordingly. It should now pass the failing test case provided.
