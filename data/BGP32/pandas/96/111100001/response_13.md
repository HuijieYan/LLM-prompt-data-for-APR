### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is performing business hour arithmetic calculations on datetime objects. The issue seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours and days.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` when `n >= 0` and `other.time()` is not in `self.end` or `_is_on_offset(other)` is False.
2. Adjustment of `other` when `n < 0` and `other.time()` is in `self.start`.
3. Calculation of business hours and adjustment for business days.
4. Looping logic to adjust for remaining business hours.
5. Comparison of `bhour_remain` and adjustment of `other` accordingly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object in different scenarios. The logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` in combination with checking `other.time()` against `self.start` and `self.end` seems to be causing the bug. This leads to inaccurate calculations and results in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on business hours and days for both positive and negative values of `n`.
2. Check the conditions for moving to the next business time interval and adjust `other` accordingly.
3. Correctly handle the remaining business hours to ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.on_offset(other)
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version avoids the previous logic errors and ensures proper adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours and days. It should pass the failing test scenario provided.
