### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to apply business hours to a datetime object, adjusting it based on the specified business hours.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment of the datetime object when handling negative business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour with holidays and expects a specific result, but the buggy function does not produce the correct output.
5. The bug may be caused by the incorrect logic when handling negative business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime object when the business hours are negative. There are issues with how the adjustment is done in the negative case, which leads to incorrect results when applying the custom business hour offset.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling negative business hours in the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment of the datetime object when `n < 0` needs to be corrected to ensure the proper application of the business hour offset.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

Applying this corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure that the function produces the expected results when handling custom business hours with holidays.
