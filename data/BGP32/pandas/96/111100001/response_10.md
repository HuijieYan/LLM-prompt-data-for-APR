### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is implemented within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
3. The buggy function is failing when used with a custom business hour frequency, as demonstrated in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustments are made based on the business hours and the handling of the case when the business hour spans multiple days.
5. The error location appears to be in the calculation of the adjustment for `bd` (business days adjustment) and the while loops iterating through the remaining business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation arises from incorrect handling of adjustments when the business hour spans multiple days. In cases where the adjustment requires moving to the next or previous business day, the calculations for `skip_bd` (BusinessDay adjustment) and adjustment within each business day are not correctly synchronized, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting across business days and within a single business day needs to be synchronized properly. Specifically, the calculations for moving to the next or previous business day and adjusting within the current business day should be coordinated to ensure accurate adjustment.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Extract nanosecond from the datetime
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                full_bdays = BusinessDay(n=bd).onOffset(other)
                other = other + full_bdays
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Modified Sections:
1. Adjusted the synchronization between moving to the next/previous business day and adjusting within a single business day.
2. Combined the logic for business day adjustments to ensure correct adjustments.


By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle adjustments based on business hours correctly, allowing it to pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
