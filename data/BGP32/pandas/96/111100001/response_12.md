### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is part of the pandas library for handling business hours and offsets.
- The buggy function takes another datetime object (`other`) as input and is supposed to apply business hour offsets to it.
- The buggy function seems to have issues with adjusting the datetime based on business hours and handling edge cases.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to custom business hour offsets starting at 3:00 PM and having a holiday on November 26, 2020.

### Bug:
- The buggy function is not properly adjusting the input datetime based on the given business hour offsets, resulting in incorrect output.
- The bug can be observed in the failing test where the expected datetime values are not matching the actual output generated by the buggy function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime account for business hours correctly.
2. Handle edge cases such as holidays and weekends appropriately.
3. Verify that the calculations for adjusting the datetime are accurate and consider all possible scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not fall on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    # previous opening time
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    # remaining time in the day
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open
                other = other + skip_bd

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version of the `apply` function adjusts the input datetime `other` based on the business hour offsets defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The corrections aim to handle business day adjustments accurately, including taking into account holidays and weekends.
- After applying the suggested fixes, the function should now correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hours offset.
