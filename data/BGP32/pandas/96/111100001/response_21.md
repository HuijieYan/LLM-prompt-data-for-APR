## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. The function seems to have issues in handling the adjustment logic for positive and negative offsets and the calculation of remaining business hours.

## Bugs:
1. The adjustment logic in the `else` block for negative offsets seems incorrect.
2. The calculation of remaining business hours and the adjustment within the while loops might be causing issues.

## Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is incorrect adjustment for negative offsets in the `else` block of the function. This results in incorrect calculations and adjustments of the datetime object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the adjustment logic in the `else` block for negative offsets.
2. Review the calculation of remaining business hours and the adjustment within the while loops to ensure correctness.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.business import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the above corrections, the issue with the buggy function should be resolved, and it should pass the failing test provided.
