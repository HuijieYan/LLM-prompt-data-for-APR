### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime instances based on business hour offsets. The function takes another datetime instance as input and performs calculations to adjust the input datetime according to the business hours specified in the class.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the business hour adjustments are calculated and applied. Specifically, the issue may lie in the logic that determines whether to adjust the input datetime by moving it to the next opening time or the previous closing time based on whether the offset value is positive or negative.

### Bug Explanation:
When the offset `n` is negative, the code in the buggy function tries to adjust the input datetime by moving it to the previous business day's opening time. However, the logic implemented for this adjustment seems to be incorrect, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the logic related to adjusting the input datetime during negative offset scenarios. The adjustment should ensure that the datetime is correctly moved to the expected previous business day's opening time.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Fix the bug in the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)  # Corrected adjustment
            
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        # Remaining logic remains unchanged
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the highlighted correction in the adjustment logic for negative offsets, the function should now handle previous business day adjustments correctly and pass the failing test.
