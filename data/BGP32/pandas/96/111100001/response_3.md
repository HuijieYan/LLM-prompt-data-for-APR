### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions and test code:

1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is extended from `BusinessMixin` class.
2. The function `apply_wraps` is called by the `apply` function to apply certain wraps, but the body of this function is ignored.
3. The `apply` function is used to apply business hours to a given datetime object.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour offset with a start time at "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26".
5. The expected output of the test includes dates on "2020-11-25" and "2020-11-27" at "15:00" and "16:00".

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect calculation of business days offset causing the function to misplace the datetime instances.
- Improper handling of start and end times in different scenarios.
- Issues related to business hour calculation and adjustments.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect calculations in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect adjustments of the given datetime object based on the business hours offset.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper calculation of business days offset for both positive and negative values.
2. Check and correct the adjustments made to the datetime object based on business hours.
3. Address any issues related to the start and end times of the business hours.

### Corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            start_dt = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            adjusted_dt = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if adjusted_dt.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                if adjusted_dt.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_dt -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                    adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_dt)

            business_hours_total = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_total // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                adjusted_dt += business_day_offset

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)) - adjusted_dt
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        adjusted_dt += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt) - adjusted_dt
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        adjusted_dt += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the function should now properly handle the business hour calculations and adjustments, addressing the bug in the original implementation and passing the failing test.
