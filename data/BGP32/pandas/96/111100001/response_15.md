### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and returns the adjusted datetime. However, the buggy function is unable to handle custom business hours as shown in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case where the current time is already a business hour.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the conditional statements that handle whether the given datetime is within the defined business hours. In particular, the logic for adjusting the datetime when it is already within the business hours seems to be faulty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when the current time is already within business hours, the function incorrectly adjusts the datetime by moving it to the next opening time and then immediately gets the closing time, which does not match the expected behavior of skipping to the next business day when staying within the business hours.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime when it is already within business hours. Instead of immediately getting the closing time, we should check if the datetime is still within the same business day and adjust accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            # Check if remaining time is within current business hour
            if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this fix should address the bug and make the `apply` function correctly adjust the given datetime based on the defined business hours and pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
