### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours defined by the start and end times in the class. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could cause it to fail. The function involves complex logic to calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours and days.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime `other` based on the business hours and days. The logic for handling positive and negative `n` values (number of business hours) and adjusting the datetime accordingly seems to be incorrect. This could lead to incorrect adjustments when calculating the final adjusted datetime.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review and modify the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` based on the provided business hours and days. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated and applied based on the positive or negative values of `n`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            n = self.n
            if n == 0:  # No adjustment needed if n is zero
                return other

            # Adjust the other datetime based on business hours and days
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            bd = abs(n) // (businesshours // 60)
            r = abs(n) % (businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= bhour.total_seconds():
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please replace the existing buggy `apply` function with this corrected version. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
