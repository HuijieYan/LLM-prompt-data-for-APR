### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The `apply_wraps` function is called as a decorator for the `apply` function.
3. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the creation of a `DatetimeIndex` using `CustomBusinessHour` with specific start time and holidays.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function adjusts the date time based on business hours, causing the failing test to produce unexpected results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function occurs when adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The logic for adjusting the datetime is incorrect, causing the resulting `DatetimeIndex` to be different from the expected values. This discrepancy is causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours needs to be corrected. The adjustment should correctly handle positive and negative business days and properly calculate the remaining business hours to adjust.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Initial adjustment of datetime
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            skip_days = n // (businesshours // 60)
            remaining_hours = n % (businesshours // 60)

            # Adjust the datetime based on business days
            if skip_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=skip_days)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Adjust the datetime based on remaining business hours
            if remaining_hours != 0:
                while remaining_hours != 0:
                    if n >= 0:
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        bhour = next_opening - other
                    else:
                        prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        bhour = other - prev_opening

                    if bhour.seconds <= remaining_hours * 60:
                        remaining_hours -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = next_opening
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply` function as shown above, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
