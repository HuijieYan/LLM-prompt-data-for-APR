### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function `apply_wraps` is used as a decorator but doesn't return a function, it directly replaces the decorated function.
- The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hour offsets.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a custom business hour offset `CustomBusinessHour`, then uses `pd.date_range` to generate a DatetimeIndex with that frequency. The test expects specific datetime values in the resulting index.

### Bugs in the `apply` function:
1. The condition `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` should be `if not self._is_on_offset(other):`.
2. Incorrect logic in adjusting business days using `skip_bd` if `not self._is_on_offset(other)` condition is true.
3. Logic for adjusting remaining business hours `bhour_remain` is incorrect for negative offsets.
4. Issues with adding/subtracting timedelta with `bhour_remain`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the conditions and function calls as identified.
2. Fix the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours for both positive and negative offsets.
3. Ensure correct addition/subtraction of timedelta values.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - bhour) + timedelta(seconds=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the corrected version of the `apply` function should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` successfully.
