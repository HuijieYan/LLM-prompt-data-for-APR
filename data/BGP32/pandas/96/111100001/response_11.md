### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the class `BusinessHourMixin` which inherits from `BusinessMixin`. 
2. The buggy function takes a `datetime` object `other` as input and performs business hour calculations based on the business hours specified in the class attributes.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days (`skip_bd`) and remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) in the calculation process.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a `DatetimeIndex` using a custom business hour frequency which includes a holiday. The buggy function is unable to handle this scenario correctly.
5. The buggy function needs to be fixed to correctly adjust for business days and remaining business hours when encountering holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when the `apply` function encounters a holiday during the business hour adjustment process. It incorrectly handles the holiday and does not adjust the dates accordingly, leading to incorrect results in the `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for holidays while adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
2. Make sure that the adjustments correctly skip holidays and handle them during the calculation process.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:

                while self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) or other.weekday() in self.holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)

                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the checks for holidays during the adjustment of business days, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the scenario presented in the failing test correctly.
