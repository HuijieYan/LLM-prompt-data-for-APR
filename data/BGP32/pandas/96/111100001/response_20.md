### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin`. It is using various helper functions within the same class to perform calculations related to business hours.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the logic related to adjusting the `other` datetime parameter based on the business hours and days.
3. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of negative values for `n`, which determines the direction and number of business days to adjust.
4. One strategy to fix the bug would be to adjust the logic for negative values of `n` to properly handle the adjustment of `other` datetime parameter and ensure it falls on the correct business day and time intervals.
5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday(other)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for negative values of `n` and correctly handling the adjustments to the `other` datetime parameter, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
