### Analysis:
1. The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on the business hours specified.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of business hour adjustments when negative business days (`n < 0`) are passed to the function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a negative business day to generate a date range. The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect adjustments for negative business days, leading to the test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `apply` function for handling negative business days and adjust the calculations accordingly to align with the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    next_open = other
                if next_open is not None:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(next_open)
                    remain = next_open - prev_open
                    other = prev_open - BusinessDay(n=abs(bd)) + remain
                else:
                    raise ValueError('Invalid datetime offset')
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments in the `apply` function based on the corrected logic for handling negative business days, the function should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
