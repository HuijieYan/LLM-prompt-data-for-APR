### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to apply custom business hour offsets to a given datetime object. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function, such as adjustments based on the sign of the offset (`n`), calculations involving business hours, adjustments for business days, and handling remaining business hours.

### Bugs:
1. Incorrect adjustment for `n` value when it is negative.
2. Incorrect handling of business days for negative offset values.
3. Incorrect calculation of business hours to adjust remaining time.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs:
1. Correct the adjustment logic based on the sign of the offset.
2. Ensure proper handling of business days for negative offset values.
3. Fix the calculation for business hours to correctly adjust the remaining time.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

                other.year,
                other.month,

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the identified bugs and pass the failing test scenario provided.
