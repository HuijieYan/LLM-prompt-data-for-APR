### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The `apply` function is using some internal functions like `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, `_is_on_offset` which are part of the same class.
3. The bug seems to be related to calculating business hours based on a given datetime input.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks if a custom business hour offset works correctly with a specific set of holidays, but the buggy `apply` function fails to adjust the datetime properly.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would involve reviewing the logic within the `apply` function, especially the calculations related to adjusting the business hours and ensuring correct datetime manipulation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in adjusting the given datetime based on the business hour offset. The calculations for moving to the next opening time, adjusting for business days, and remaining business hours seem to be faulty, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        start_time = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.start.hour,
            self.start.minute,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the given datetime based on the business hour offset and should pass the failing test.
