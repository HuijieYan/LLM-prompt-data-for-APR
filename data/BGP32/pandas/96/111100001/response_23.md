## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has some issues related to adjusting business hours and working days when combining with a datetime object. The bug seems to be causing incorrect calculations of business hours and days adjustments.

## Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The incorrect logic in handling negative values of `n` may be causing the function to return incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic for adjusting business days and hours based on the value of `n` (number of business hours to adjust). Ensuring proper adjustment for both positive and negative values of `n` is important for the correct functioning of the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other.time) or other.time in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other.time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

        if r != 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if n < 0:
                other = other - timedelta(minutes=r)
            else:
                other = other + timedelta(minutes=r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version above, the bug in the `apply` function related to adjusting business days and hours should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test by providing the expected results.
