## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and it is decorated with `@apply_wraps`.
2. The function is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours, but it has some logical errors that cause it to fail for certain cases.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a custom business hour frequency starting at 15:00 with a holiday on November 26, 2020. It then generates a date range with this frequency and expects specific datetime values.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object within the `apply` function based on the custom business hours.

## Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from not correctly handling the case when the adjusted datetime falls on a holiday. The code is not correctly skipping the holiday when adjusting the date, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the adjusted datetime falls on a holiday and skip it if necessary.
2. Ensure that the adjustment correctly handles all cases considering business hours, holidays, and weekends.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
