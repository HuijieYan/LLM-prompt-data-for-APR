### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and it applies offset adjustments to a datetime object based on business hours.
2. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and business hours since the test is failing with unexpected datetime values.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing to generate the expected datetime values when using `CustomBusinessHour` with custom holidays, indicating an issue with the offset adjustment logic in the `apply` function.
4. The bug might be related to incorrect handling of negative business hour offsets and adjustments for skipping business days.
5. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and business hours in the `apply` function to ensure correct offset calculations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for adjusting business days and business hours in the `apply` function to handle negative business hour offsets correctly and adjust for skipping business days.
2. Verify the logic for moving to the next or previous opening time based on the business hours and include appropriate calculations for adjusting the datetime accordingly.
3. Ensure that the offset adjustments consider the given business constraints and custom holidays for the desired datetime results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_opening_time(other).time() in self.start or not self._prev_opening_time(other).time() in self.end:
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd + timedelta(seconds=1)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the `apply` function should now handle the business day and business hour adjustments correctly for the given offsets, enabling it to pass the failing test scenario.
