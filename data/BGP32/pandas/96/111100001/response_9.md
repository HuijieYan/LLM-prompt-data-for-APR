## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is decorated with `@apply_wraps`, which might be causing some issues.
2. The function is meant to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime object, adjusting it based on the business days and hours specified in the class attributes.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and hours when adjusting the datetime object. The failing test is trying to create a date range with custom business hours starting at 15:00 on November 25th, 2020, and the expectation is that the resulting date range should skip November 26th, which is a holiday.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve debugging the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business days and hours, making sure to correctly handle the skipping of holidays.

## Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.hour >= self.end.hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.hour < self.start.hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if other.hour >= self.end.hour:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    elif bhour_remain >= timedelta(hours=1):
                        other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    else:
                        seconds_to_add = bhour_remain.seconds
                        other = other + timedelta(seconds=seconds_to_add)
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if other.hour < self.start.hour:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                    elif bhour_remain >= timedelta(hours=1):
                        other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    else:
                        seconds_to_add = bhour_remain.seconds
                        other = other + timedelta(seconds=seconds_to_add)
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test mentioned earlier. Make sure to test the fix against this failing test case and other relevant test cases to ensure the correctness of the modification.
