### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on a set of business hour rules.
2. The function has a lot of conditional logic that checks the input datetime object, adjusts it based on business hour rules, and then returns the adjusted result.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic within the function, resulting in incorrect output for certain cases.
4. The buggy function is failing a test related to custom business hours, where the adjusted datetime objects are not matching the expected values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the adjustment logic in the `apply` function and ensure it correctly adjusts the datetime objects based on the business hour rules.

### Bug Fix:
I have identified a potential issue in the adjustment logic where the calculation of remaining business hours is not handled correctly. I will focus on correcting this part of the function to address the bug.

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Initial setup and logic remain the same
        
        # New adjustment logic for handling remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        # Remaining logic remains the same
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling remaining business hours in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test related to custom business hours.
