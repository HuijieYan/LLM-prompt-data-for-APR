## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the class attributes. It calculates the adjusted datetime by considering the business hours and days, and edge cases like the closing time, opening time, and holidays.

## Identified Errors:
1. In the calculation of `other`:
   - The function resets the timezone and nanosecond by creating a new datetime object using year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond components of the input `other`. This could result in losing the original timezone information.
2. Incorrect usage of `self.next_bday`:
   - In the segment for adjusting by business days, it wrongly refers to `self.next_bday` instead of invoking it as a method.
3. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours:
   - The logic for adjusting remaining business hours in both positive and negative cases seems flawed. It doesn't consider all scenarios correctly, leading to potential inaccuracies.

## Bug Causes:
The primary cause of the bug stems from improper handling and manipulation of datetime objects within the function. In particular, the inappropriate reset of timezone and nanosecond attributes and the misuse of `self.next_bday` contribute to the incorrect behavior of the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Preserve the original timezone information of the input `other` datetime object.
2. Correctly invoke the `self.next_bday()` method instead of referencing it directly.
3. Enhance the logic for adjusting remaining business hours to cover all scenarios accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Preserve original timezone information
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=other.tzinfo)

        # Adjust 'other' for business hours based on positive or negative n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hours calculation for adjustment
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust remaining business hours accurately
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if n < 0 and bhour_remain == bhour and other.time().nanosecond != 0:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            elif bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the timezone information is preserved, `self.next_bday()` method is invoked correctly, and the remaining business hours are adjusted accurately for positive and negative `n` values.
