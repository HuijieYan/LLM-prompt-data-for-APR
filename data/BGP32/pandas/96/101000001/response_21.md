The buggy function `apply` has a logic error in handling adjustments for negative values of business hours (`n`). The bug arises when adjusting the `other` datetime object for negative business hours, where the function expects the calculations to behave differently than it should.

### Bug Explanation:
When the value of `n` is negative, the buggy function should adjust the `other` datetime object in a different way compared to when `n` is positive. However, the bug manifests in the logic used for these adjustments. The function incorrectly handles the adjustment for negative `n` values, leading to incorrect results.

The issue arises from the incorrect usage of the condition `if other.time() in self.start`, which should not be executed when `n` is negative. This condition is supposed to determine if the time falls within the business hours defined by `self.start` and `self.end`, which should only be checked when `n` is non-negative. Additionally, the adjustment calculation for negative `n` values and the handling of business days are not appropriately implemented, leading to erroneous behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, follow these steps:
1. Make sure to handle negative `n` values separately from positive ones to adjust the `other` datetime object correctly.
2. Remove the unnecessary conditional check related to `self.start` when `n` is negative.
3. Adjust the logic for business day calculations and business hour adjustments based on the negative or positive value of `n`.
4. Ensure that the adjustments and calculations are done consistently and accurately based on the business hours and days specified.
5. Update the logic to correctly handle the adjustment for negative `n` values and validate the results accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to next open time
            # Adjust to previous business day
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
    
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        while bd != 0:
            if bd < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - BusinessDay(n=1)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) + BusinessDay(n=1)
            bd -= 1

        if n >= 0:
            offset = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while offset > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if offset < bhour:
                    other += offset
                    offset = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    offset -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            offset = timedelta(minutes=-r)
            while offset < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if offset >= bhour:
                    other += offset
                    offset = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    offset -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the buggy behavior and correctly handle adjustments for negative business hour values. Ensure to test the function with various inputs to validate its correctness.
