The bug in the provided function lies in the calculation of the business hour adjustment. The issue arises when handling negative values of n (number of business hours to adjust). When n is negative, the adjustments to the "other" datetime object are not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, adjust the calculation logic for negative values of n in the code section where n is less than 0.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if abs(bhour.total_seconds()) <= abs(bhour_remain.total_seconds()):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:  # Remaining adjustment fits within current business interval
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment for negative values of n has been modified to ensure the correct calculation of business hours. The adjustment logic has been simplified to address the bug and provide the expected behavior.
