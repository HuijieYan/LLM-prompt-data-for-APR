The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect referencing of the `next_bday` attribute. The code is trying to access it as an attribute of the class `self`, but it should be accessed as a method. This incorrect access is causing a `AttributeError`.

Here's the strategy to fix the bug:
1. Modify the code to call the `next_bday()` method instead of trying to access it directly.
2. Ensure that the `next_bday()` method is defined appropriately in the class or another related class.
3. Handle any additional issues that might arise during the fix.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # code truncated for readability
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):  # Fixed the calling of the next_bday method
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # remaining code remains the same
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the method call to `next_bday()` with parentheses added, the bug related to the incorrect access should be resolved, and the function should work without raising an `AttributeError`.
