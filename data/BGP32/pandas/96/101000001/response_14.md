### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to handle business hour offsets with datetime objects. The function aims to adjust the input datetime based on the business hours determined by the start and end times established for a business day.

### Bugs Identified:
1. **Incorrect Variable Access & Assignment**:
    - In the section where `n` is determined (line 23), it accesses `self.n` while it should access `self.factor` for the offset value.

2. **Misuse of Conditions**:
    - The conditions checking for end and start times (lines 27 and 29) are not appropriate and should be revised.
    - Incorrect condition for `skip_bd` calculation that might lead to unexpected results.
    
### Cause of Bug:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect access to variables coupled with improper condition checks within the logic flow of the function. These issues lead to incorrect adjustments being made to the input datetime object.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the variable access from `self.n` to `self.factor` for determining the offset value.
2. Adjust the conditions properly to handle edge cases more accurately.
3. Update the `skip_bd` calculation to align with the business hours calculation and offset adjustment.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.factor # Change variable access from self.n to self.factor
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= max(self.end) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < min(self.start):
                    other = other.replace(hour=min(self.start).hour, minute=min(self.start).minute)

                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0)):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version adjusts the variable access, refines the condition checks, and updates the `skip_bd` calculation to handle the business hour offsets with datetime objects accurately.
