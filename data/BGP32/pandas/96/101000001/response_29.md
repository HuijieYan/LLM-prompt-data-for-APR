## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified by the object's attributes. It handles cases where the adjustment needs to consider moving to the next/previous business day, calculating the remaining business hours, and adjusting the datetime accordingly.

## Identified Issues:
1. The variable `self.next_bday` is incorrectly referenced as an attribute without calling it as a method.
2. In the check for moving to the next business day when adjusting by business days, the condition `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` should be `self.is_on_offset(other)`.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The incorrect reference to `self.next_bday` as an attribute instead of a method causes a `AttributeError`.
2. The incorrect condition with `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` prevents the adjustment by business days from working correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly call `self.next_bday()` when checking for moving to the next business day in the adjustment by business days.
2. Replace `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` with `self.is_on_offset(other)` to ensure the correct condition is checked for adjusting by business days.
