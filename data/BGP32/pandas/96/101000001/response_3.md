The buggy function has an issue with the calculation of opening and closing times for business hours. The error occurs in the logic for adjusting the time based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

The bug involves incorrectly adjusting the time when the number of business hours is negative. In this case, the function should adjust the time to the previous opening time and then calculate the closing time based on the next opening time. However, the function does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect time adjustments.

To fix this bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary condition for adjusting the time backward by subtracting 1 second.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle the case when the number of business hours is negative by adjusting the time to the previous opening time and then calculating the closing time based on the next opening time.
3. Correct the handling of remaining business hours to ensure the time adjustment is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + (other - prev_open)
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

                if n < 0 and bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and nanosecond != 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This correction updates the logic for adjusting the time based on the business hour offset, ensuring accurate adjustments for both positive and negative business hour values.
