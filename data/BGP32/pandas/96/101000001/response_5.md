The bug in the provided function is caused by incorrect logic in handling negative business hours (n < 0). When n is negative, the function is not correctly adjusting the business hours and moving to the previous day while considering the closing time. This leads to incorrect results when attempting to apply the business hours offset.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the negative n branch to correctly handle the business hours and move to the previous day's closing time. We also need to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly based on the input datetime object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd
            r = -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + (other - prev_open)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

In this corrected version, the adjustments for negative business hours (n < 0) are properly handled, ensuring that the function moves to the correct previous day's closing time and adjusts the business hours accordingly.

By fixing the logic in the negative n branch and adjusting the business hour offsets correctly, the function should now work as expected and produce the desired results for all cases.
