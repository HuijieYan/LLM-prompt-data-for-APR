The potential error location in the buggy function is in the calculation of the adjusted datetime value based on the business hours and the direction of adjustment. The loop for adjusting the remaining business hours may not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The bug could be causing incorrect adjustments of the datetime value when the business hours are negative. The code logic within the loops for adjusting remaining hours might not be correctly accounting for all scenarios, leading to incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic within the loops for adjusting remaining business hours to ensure proper handling of cases with negative business hours.
2. Check the conditions for finishing adjustments and moving to the next business time interval to ensure correctness in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if bd > 0 else self.next_bday.rollback(other)
                
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of datetime values based on business hours is handled more robustly to ensure correctness in all scenarios, including cases with negative business hours. This should address the bug and provide the expected behavior of the function.
