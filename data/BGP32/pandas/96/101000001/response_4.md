The potential error in the buggy function lies in the way that the `other` datetime is manipulated and adjusted based on business hours. The bug is likely to be caused by incorrect adjustments leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `other` datetime correctly based on the defined business hours and handle the adjustments properly during the loop iterations. We should also ensure that the correct business days are skipped and the remaining business hours are adjusted accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on the start and end times of the business day
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in a business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_day = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if self._is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) + business_day

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        business_hour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while business_hour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if business_hour_remain < bhour:
                    other += business_hour_remain
                    business_hour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    business_hour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while business_hour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if business_hour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    business_hour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += business_hour_remain
                    business_hour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made based on the start and end times of the business day, business hours calculation is done accurately, correct business days are skipped, and remaining hours are adjusted properly during the loop iterations.
