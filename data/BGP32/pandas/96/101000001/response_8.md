The bug in the provided function is related to the calculation of business hours and time intervals. The issue appears to stem from incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object 'other' based on the number of business hours (n) specified.

To fix this bug, we need to focus on the calculation of business days and remaining business hours adjustments in the 'apply' function. The incorrect handling of time intervals and business hours is likely causing the unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the 'apply' function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- Removed unnecessary calculations related to business hours and intervals that were causing issues.
- Simplified the adjustment of the datetime object 'other' based on the specified number of business hours.
- Loop through the adjustment of 'other' according to the positive or negative value of 'n' to ensure accurate movement within the business hours.

By implementing these changes, the bug in the 'apply' function should be resolved, and the function should now correctly adjust the datetime object based on the specified number of business hours.
