## Analysis:
1. The `apply` function is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours defined in the class.
2. The function contains multiple conditional blocks handling positive and negative values of `n`.
3. The function aims to adjust the datetime object based on the business hours and business days specified.
4. The `apply` function calls several internal functions of the same class to perform the adjustments.

## Bugs Identified:
1. The loop logic for adjusting business hours based on the remaining time is incorrect.
2. The calculation of business days adjustment is flawed as it leads to incorrect results.
3. There are issues with adjusting the time intervals based on the business hours.

## Bug Causes:
1. The incorrect handling of the loop in adjusting business hours leads to incorrect adjustments.
2. Flawed logic for adjusting business days based on the input value `bd` which results in incorrect calculations.
3. Mismanagement in adjusting time intervals within the business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the loop logic to properly handle the adjustment of business hours based on the remaining time.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting business days to ensure accurate calculations.
3. Refine the approach to adjusting time intervals within business hours for proper results.
