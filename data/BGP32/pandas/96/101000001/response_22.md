## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and a specified offset. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect results:
1. The calculation of business hours may not be accurate, especially when handling negative offsets.
2. Adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours may lead to deviation from the expected result.
3. Handling of edge conditions in adjusting the datetime object may not be properly implemented.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to inaccuracies in adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and the specified offset. This leads to incorrect results when calculating the new datetime object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours for positive and negative offsets.
2. Properly adjust the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours.
3. Handle edge conditions effectively to achieve the desired result.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other based on offset sign
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

I have made corrections to the function by adjusting the calculations of business hours, handling offsets accurately, and properly adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours.
