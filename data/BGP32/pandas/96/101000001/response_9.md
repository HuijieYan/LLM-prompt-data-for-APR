The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue lies in the logic used to adjust the datetime object `other` based on business hours and business days. The calculation of business hours is causing unexpected behavior.

Here are the potential issues with the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of business days when adjusting the datetime object `other`.
2. Inaccurate calculation of business hours within the given business day.
3. Incorrect comparison and adjustment of remaining business hours.

To fix these issues, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime object `other` based on business days and business hours. We must also accurately calculate the total business hours in a given day and appropriately handle remaining business hour adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), math.ceil(businesshours / 60))
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned earlier and provides a more accurate and reliable implementation for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and business days.
