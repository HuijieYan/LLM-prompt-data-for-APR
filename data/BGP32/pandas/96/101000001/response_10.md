The bug in the provided function is related to the logic for adjusting dates and times based on business hours. The key issue lies in the calculation of business hours and attempting to adjust the input datetime accordingly.

1. Potential Error: 
   - Incorrect calculation of business hours.
   - Incorrect handling of the adjustment logic for different scenarios.
   
2. Cause of the Bug: 
   - The buggy function does not accurately calculate the number of business hours and does not properly adjust the input datetime according to the business hours.
   - Incorrect comparison and adjustment logic within the while loops, leading to unexpected behavior.

3. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Correctly calculate the total business hours within a day.
   - Ensure accurate adjustments based on the given number of business hours.
   - Improve the comparison logic to correctly adjust the datetime for both positive and negative number of business hours.

4. Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Calculate business days and remaining minutes
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), (businesshours // 60))

            # Adjust for negative number of business hours
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            while bd != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=bd))
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=bd))
                bd = bd - 1

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
  
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour > bhour_remain:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to calculating and adjusting business hours. It ensures that the input datetime is adjusted correctly based on the specified number of business hours.
