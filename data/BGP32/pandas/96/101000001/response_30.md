The buggy function has an issue related to the adjustment of business hours in different time intervals. The code is trying to handle adjustments based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. However, the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours in each interval is causing the bug.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours in each interval based on the sign of `n` (positive or negative). Additionally, considering the start and end times of the business hours intervals is crucial for correctly adjusting the datetime object.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            shift_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
        else:
            shift_time = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), 1)  # divmod to get business days and remaining hours

        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd

        other += bd * shift_time  # adjust by business days

        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    time_left = (next_opening - other)
                    if time_left >= timedelta(minutes=r):
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= time_left.total_seconds() / 60
                        other = next_opening
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    time_to_prev_closing = other - self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    if time_to_prev_closing >= timedelta(minutes=abs(r)):
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r += time_to_prev_closing.total_seconds() / 60
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- The adjustment of business days is done before handling the remaining business hours.
- The logic for adjusting remaining business hours in each business time interval has been revised based on the sign of `n`.
- The use of timedelta for handling minutes has been improved.

With these modifications, the bug in the original function should be fixed, and the function should work correctly for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours.
