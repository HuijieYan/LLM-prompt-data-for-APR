1. The buggy function "apply" is designed to combine business hours with datetime values. The function checks if the input "other" is an instance of datetime and performs various calculations and adjustments based on the business hours defined within the class.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The calculations related to adjusting the datetime values based on business hours.
   - Comparison of timedelta values and conditions for adjusting the datetime values.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect adjustments of datetime values within the while loops based on business hours. Inconsistent handling of timedelta values and conditions for advancing or adjusting the datetime values may lead to incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for adjusting the datetime values based on business hours. We should ensure that the adjustments align with the defined business hours and properly handle the remaining time left within a business day.

5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond for consistency
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting datetime values based on business hours is simplified and made more consistent. The adjustments are aligned with the specified business hours, and the remaining time within a business day is handled properly.
