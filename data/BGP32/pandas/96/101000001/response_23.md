The bug in the provided function is related to the calculation of business hours adjustment. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to adjust the remaining business hours.

The buggy function attempts to adjust the remaining business hours in a loop based on whether the value of `n` (number of business hours to adjust) is positive or negative. However, there are logical errors in the calculations leading to incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the remaining business hours are adjusted correctly in both cases, considering the specific business time intervals defined by the `start` and `end` attributes of the class. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Initial timezone and nanosecond adjustments
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, remaining_minutes = -bd, -remaining_minutes

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        # Remaining minutes adjustment
        if remaining_minutes != 0:
            current_time = other
            sign = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                if sign == 1:
                    closing_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)

                    time_diff = closing_time - current_time
                    if remaining_minutes < time_diff.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        remaining_minutes = 0
                    else:
                        other = closing_time
                        remaining_minutes -= time_diff.total_seconds() // 60
                        current_time = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                else:
                    opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(current_time)

                    time_diff = current_time - opening_time
                    if remaining_minutes <= time_diff.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        remaining_minutes = 0
                    else:
                        other = opening_time
                        remaining_minutes -= time_diff.total_seconds() // 60
                        current_time = opening_time

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- I fixed the logic for adjusting remaining minutes based on the specific business time intervals defined by the `start` and `end` attributes.
- Adjusted the loop to handle remaining minutes correctly, ensuring that the adjustments are made accurately whether `n` is positive or negative.
- Made adjustments based on the opening and closing times within the business day.

This corrected implementation should resolve the bug present in the original function.
