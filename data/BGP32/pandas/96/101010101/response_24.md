### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is failing with a `ValueError` when trying to validate the frequency against the inferred frequency. The error message indicates that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH". This error occurs during a test involving CustomBusinessHour frequencies. The function is not correctly handling the frequency validation with CustomBusinessHour offsets.

The function is expected to manipulate datetime objects based on custom business hours, but it fails to handle the CustomBusinessHour offset correctly, resulting in the ValueError during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function `apply` needs to correctly adjust the `other` datetime object based on the custom business hours provided by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. This adjustment includes handling the business days, remaining business hours, and moving through business time intervals.

### Bug Fix
I have corrected the bug in the `apply` function with the following changes:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same

    # corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            
            n = self.n

            # adjust other based on CustomBusinessHour
            if n > 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # adjust for remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    
                    if n > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return other
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the datetime objects based on the provided CustomBusinessHour offsets and pass the failing test cases.
