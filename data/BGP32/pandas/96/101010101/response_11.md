## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on CustomBusinessHours. The error message suggests that there is an issue with validating the frequency of the datetime index when using a CustomBusinessHour frequency.

The error message indicates that the validation of the frequency fails when generating the date range. This issue likely stems from incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function that lead to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency compared to the passed frequency.

The implementation of the adjustments by business days and remaining business hours is crucial in correctly updating the timestamp. The bugs in these adjustments are likely causing the mismatch in frequencies detected during validation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that adjustments for negative and positive durations are performed correctly.
2. Verify that adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are accurately reflected, avoiding any discrepancies.
3. Address any inconsistencies in timezone or nanosecond values during adjustments.
4. Make sure that the time of the adjusted timestamp aligns with business hours as expected.

## Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis and strategy outlined above.

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self.end[0].hour - other.hour
                    if r <= bhour * 60:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=bhour * 60)
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(hours=bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other.hour - self.start[0].hour
                    if r <= bhour * 60 or (r == bhour * 60 and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=bhour * 60)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments for business days and remaining hours are appropriately handled to align the timestamp with the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This should address the frequency validation issue in the failing test cases.
