The bug in the provided function is related to how the `other` variable is handled and adjusted based on the business hour. The bug stems from incorrect calculations and adjustments in the loop that handles adjusting the business hours.

To address this bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting business hours and ensure that the adjustments are accurate. Additionally, we need to ensure that all conditions and edge cases are handled correctly to avoid errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply_wraps(func):
    # Wrapper function for applying wraps
    pass

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                time_to_open = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < time_to_open:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                elif bhour_remain == time_to_open and nanosecond != 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= time_to_open
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making adjustments to the loop that handles the adjustment of business hours, we can ensure that the function now correctly handles the business hours calculation and adjustments. This correction should address the issue identified in the failing test and ensure that the expected input/output values are met for all cases.
