### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on a specified custom business hour. However, the error occurs when validating the frequency of the adjusted timestamp against the expected frequency. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to be located in the handling of frequencies or adjustments made to the timestamp that impact the frequency validation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs during frequency validation when the function `_validate_frequency` tries to generate a range of dates based on the passed frequency. This process fails because the inferred frequency derived from the index does not match the supplied frequency. The function attempts to generate a date range based on these frequencies and raises a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjusted timestamps retain the correct frequency alignment with the specified custom business hour. This may involve adjustments in the logic of adjusting the timestamps or ensuring that the frequencies are correctly handled throughout the calculation process.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        from pandas import Timestamp
        
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            adjusted_dt = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)  # Adjust timestamp without affecting frequency
            
            if n >= 0:
                if adjusted_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                if adjusted_dt.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_dt -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                    adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_dt)
            
            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By introducing the adjustment to the timestamp without altering the frequency vector, the corrected function should now handle the specified custom business hour correctly.
