### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. However, it is failing to pass the test due to a mismatch in the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency.

The potential error locations are identified in the datetime adjustments, calculations for business hours, adjustments for business days, and handling of remaining business hours.

The bug is caused by the inconsistencies in the adjustments made to the input datetime object `other`. These adjustments lead to incorrect calculations and comparisons concerning the business hours and days, eventually resulting in a flawed return value, leading to a failed test.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the input datetime object should be revised to ensure correct calculations and comparisons with business hours and days. Any logic that affects the overall result should be carefully analyzed and adjusted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = skip_bd.apply(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version revises the datetime adjustments and improves the logic related to business hours and days. These adjustments aim to ensure accurate calculations and comparisons, ultimately leading to the correct return value and passing the test cases.
