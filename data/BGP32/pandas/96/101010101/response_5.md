### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` value based on a set of business hours defined by `start` and `end` times. The function calculates the adjusted time by considering the number of business days and remaining business hours. The bug seems to be related to the way the adjustments are made within the function.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency when generating a `DatetimeIndex` based on a custom business hour frequency. This error is likely caused by incorrect adjustments within the `apply` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function may be related to how business hours are calculated and adjusted based on the input datetime and the specified business hours. The adjustments to move to the next business time interval or closing time might not be correctly handled, leading to incorrect results and causing the frequency mismatch error observed during the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the frequency mismatch error, we need to review the logic related to adjusting the datetime based on business hours and make sure that the adjustments are correctly performed. Additionally, we should pay attention to how the adjustments are made to ensure they align with the expected behavior when calculating business days and hours.

### Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            if r != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    while r > 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0
                        else:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                            r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                else:
                    while r > 0:
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                        if r > bhour.seconds // 60 or (r == bhour.seconds // 60 and other.nanosecond != 0):
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0
                        else:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                            r -= bhour.seconds // 60

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By aligning the adjustments to the business days and remaining hours within each time interval correctly, this updated version of the `apply` function should resolve the bug and prevent the frequency mismatch error observed during the test.
