### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a timestamp based on a custom business hour frequency. The function makes calculations to adjust the given timestamp by the specified number of business hours. However, due to some buggy logic, the function fails to return the correct adjusted timestamp in certain cases.

The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency of the input index, which ultimately leads to a `ValueError`. This error occurs when the frequency inferred from the values does not conform to the passed frequency. The bug in the `apply` function might be causing incorrect adjustments to the timestamp, leading to an incorrect frequency validation.

The function works with custom business hours defined with a specific start and end time, accounting for potential holidays. It calculates business hours between start and end times and adjusts the timestamp accordingly by the specified number of business hours.

### Bug in the Code
- The logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the number of business hours is raising an issue, leading to incorrect frequency validation.
- There are inconsistencies with whether to consider or skip business days, affecting the adjustment process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the logic of adjusting the timestamp for positive and negative number of business hours separately.
2. Ensure proper handling of edge cases where adjustments require skipping business days or moving between business intervals.
3. Verify the calculations related to business hours and adjustments based on working hours and holidays.
4. Pay close attention to how the adjustments are made within the business hours to avoid inaccuracies.
5. Refactor the adjustment process to calculate the adjusted timestamp correctly based on the specified business hours.

```

By correcting the logic around adjusting the timestamps for positive and negative business hours, the `apply` function should now accurately adjust the given timestamp based on the specified business hour frequency. This should resolve the failing test cases and ensure the proper functioning of the custom business hour frequency adjustments.
