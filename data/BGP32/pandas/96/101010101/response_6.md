The bug in the given function is related to the validation of custom frequencies in the `apply` method. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency validation when using a custom frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour). The expected behavior is to allow the propagation of the custom frequency during the method's execution without triggering a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation properly handles the custom frequency `CBH` in the `apply` method by adjusting the way the frequency is validated during the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, 'freq') or other.freq not in ['CBH']:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on the current custom business hour definition
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculations to adjust the business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust hours based on business hours
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle custom frequencies and pass the failing test cases according to the expected values mentioned above.
