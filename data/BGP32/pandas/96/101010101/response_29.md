The bug in the provided function is causing a ValueError due to frequency validation not conforming on a Datetime Index creation, which is identified by the test case execution. The issue seems to arise from the incorrect datetime handling and adjustment logic within the `apply` function.

Here is a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that datetime objects are handled consistently and correctly throughout the function.
2. Verify the adjustments made to the datetime values are accurate and aligned with the business hour logic.
3. Double-check the boundary conditions and edge cases to prevent any unexpected behavior.

Based on the identified bug and the expected variable values/types, let's correct the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, time

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                0, # Resetting seconds and microseconds
            )
            
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    return self._next_opening_time(other)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        break
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the datetime handling issues and should now properly adjust the datetime values based on business hour logic. As a result, the function should pass the failing test cases and the expected input/output values.
