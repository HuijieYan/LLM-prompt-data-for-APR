The bug in the provided function is causing a `ValueError` during frequency validation, specifically when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the expected frequency for `CustomBusinessHour` (CBH) in the failing test.

### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `apply`, seems to be intended to adjust datetime objects based on business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. The error message indicates a failure in frequency validation for a `DateOffset`.
3. The bug likely arises due to mismatched frequency between the passed values and the expected frequency, leading to an incorrect comparison during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation compares inferred frequency with the expected frequency correctly. This can be achieved by adjusting how the validation is performed and ensuring that the frequency is properly set up for `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Updated/Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if hasattr(other, "freq") and other.freq == "CBH":
            # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond for Timestamp objects
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
        # Business hour adjustment logic
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the frequency validation issue and ensure that the function operates correctly with `CustomBusinessHour` frequencies. It should pass the failing test cases and comply with the expected input/output values outlined for each case.
