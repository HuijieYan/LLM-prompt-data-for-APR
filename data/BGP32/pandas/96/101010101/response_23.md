The bug in the `apply()` function is causing a `ValueError` during the test execution. The issue seems to be related to frequency validation. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

The bug occurs because when adjusting the `other` datetime object within the `apply()` function, the process unintentionally removes the frequency information associated with the object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the frequency information is retained when adjusting the datetime object. One way to achieve this is by creating a new `Timestamp` object with the adjusted date and time values while preserving the frequency information.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            freq = getattr(other, 'freq', None)
            other = other.replace(
                year=other.year,

                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond,
                freq=freq
            )
            n = self.n

This corrected version ensures that the frequency information is preserved when adjusting the `other` datetime object, preventing the `ValueError` related to frequency in the failing test cases.

Now, when you run the failing test with this corrected function, it should pass successfully with the expected input/output values.
