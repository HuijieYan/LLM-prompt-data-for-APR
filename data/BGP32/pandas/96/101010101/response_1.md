### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime to the next or previous business hour based on a set of business rules. However, the function is failing with a `ValueError` during specific test cases related to date ranges with custom business hours.

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the input datetime object `other` based on the business rules (start and end times, holidays, etc.) defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The adjustment logic appears to be incorrect, leading to an erroneous result for certain test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Analyze the adjustment process of the input datetime object `other` against the business rules.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic correctly handles positive and negative business hour offsets.
3. Verify that the adjustment handles edge cases where the input datetime falls exactly on the start or end of a business hour.
4. Update the adjustment logic to align `other` with the nearest valid business hour based on the business rules.
5. Make sure that the adjustment process correctly calculates the business day shifts and remaining business hours to adjust.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the adjustment logic fixed based on the described strategy:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        adjustment = n * 60

        other_ts = pd.Timestamp(other)
        sign = 1 if adjustment >= 0 else -1

        if sign == 1:
            if other_ts.freq != self.freqstr or other_ts.time() >= self.start[0] or self._is_on_offset(other_ts):
                other_ts = pd.Timestamp(self._next_opening_time(other_ts))
        else:
            if other_ts.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other_ts -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)

            while not self._is_on_offset(other_ts):
                other_ts = pd.Timestamp(self._next_opening_time(other_ts))

            other_ts = pd.Timestamp(self._get_closing_time(other_ts))
            
        bd, r = divmod(abs(adjustment), businesshours // 60)
        if adjustment < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other_ts += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)

        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r) if r else pd.Timedelta(0)
        
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if sign == 1:
                bhour = pd.Timestamp(self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other_ts))) - other_ts
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(pd.Timestamp(other_ts)) - other_ts
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other_ts += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other_ts = pd.Timestamp(self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(pd.Timestamp(other_ts + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1))))

        return other_ts
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now accurately adjust the input datetime object according to the specified business hour rules and handle edge cases to pass the failing test cases.
