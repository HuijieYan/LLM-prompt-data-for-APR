### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime `other` by a specified number of CustomBusinessHours based on the settings of the CustomBusinessHour object it belongs to. The function encounters an issue where it fails to validate the frequency, causing a ValueError to be raised during the test execution.

The issue arises when attempting to validate the frequency between the generated datetime index and the provided frequency. This error occurs due to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency and the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency and the provided CustomBusinessHour frequency align properly. This can be achieved by updating the validation process to compare the frequencies more accurately to prevent the ValueError.

By updating the logic in the `apply` function to handle the frequency validation correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results.
