## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime `other` based on a business hour offset specified by the class it belongs to. It performs calculations to adjust the datetime to the nearest business hour.

The bug causes a `ValueError` to be raised during the test execution. The error message indicates that the `Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH` which implies a mismatch in the frequency validation.

The key issue lies in the part of the code that involves the updating of `other` based on the business hour offset logic. It seems that the adjustment does not correctly account for the business hour window, leading to an incorrect output causing the frequency mismatch error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic for the given datetime `other` aligns with the business hour window specified by the class. This will involve properly handling the adjustment by business days and remaining business hours.

To do this, we should carefully review the adjustment steps and make sure that the logic accurately calculates and updates the `other` datetime according to the specified business hour offset.

## Bug-free Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            # Adjust to previous business day
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

After applying these corrections, the function should be able to correctly adjust the given datetime `other` based on the specified business hour offset and pass the failing test cases.
