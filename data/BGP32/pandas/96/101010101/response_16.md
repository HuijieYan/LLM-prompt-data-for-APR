### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given timestamp according to CustomBusinessHour settings. However, it fails during the test due to an issue with frequency validation. The function converts the provided `other` argument into a `datetime` object and then performs adjustments based on business hours and days.

The bug seems to be related to the transformations applied to the `other` object since the error occurs during the frequency validation. The error message states that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, so there might be an issue with how the `other` value is modified or used in the calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp do not interfere with the frequency validation checks. We should focus on maintaining the integrity of the timestamp while applying the necessary business-specific adjustments. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function returns a valid timestamp that conforms to the specified frequency.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function addressing the identified bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas import Timestamp
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.round('1s')
        
        # Adjust timestamp based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other = other + CustomBusinessHour()  # Move to the next business hour
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)  # Adjustment to move to previous hour
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        other = other + CustomBusinessHour(n * 2)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp do not interfere with the frequency validation checks. Additionally, it maintains the specified business hours and days without compromising the integrity of the timestamp.
