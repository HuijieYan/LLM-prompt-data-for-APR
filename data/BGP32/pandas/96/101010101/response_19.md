### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour. However, it currently contains a bug that leads to a ValueError being raised during the test execution. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic within the function, specifically in the calculations related to adjusting for business hours and days. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the adjustment in certain cases, leading to a mismatch in frequencies.

To address this issue, we need to review the adjustment logic within the `apply` function and ensure that it properly adjusts the datetime object based on the CustomBusinessHour's parameters.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Adjust the timestamp based on the CustomBusinessHour schedule
        adjusted_time = other
        while n > 0:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                n -= 1
            else:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(hours=1)

        while n < 0:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                n += 1
            else:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustments are performed correctly based on the CustomBusinessHour schedule. It properly handles both positive and negative values of `n` and adjusts the timestamp accordingly.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
