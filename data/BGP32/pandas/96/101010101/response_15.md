### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function is causing a `ValueError` to be raised during the execution of a test related to custom business hours in the Pandas library. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency (CBH: Custom Business Hour) on a specific input.

The issue seems to be related to the processing of business hours and days within the `apply` function. The function is not correctly adjusting the input timestamp according to the specified business hours for positive and negative increments. This incorrect adjustment is leading to the failure of frequency validation and the subsequent `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly adjust the input timestamp based on the defined business hours. The adjustment should handle both positive and negative increments correctly while considering the start and end times of business hours.

### Bug Fix Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function with the necessary fixes to address the bug:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the timestamp based on the business hours and days according to the given increment `n`, this corrected version of the function should resolve the `ValueError` and pass the failing test cases related to the custom business hours.
