### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given other datetime to the nearest business hour according to the specified rules. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the business day adjustments and remaining business hours.

From the error message, it seems that there is an issue with the frequency validation when generating a new range of dates. This suggests that the buggy function is not adjusting the input datetime `other` correctly based on the specified business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime are aligned with the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Check the conditions for adjusting `other` datetime based on the business start and end times.
2. Verify the adjustments done for business days and remaining business hours to ensure they are correct.
3. Make sure that the final adjusted datetime aligns with the business hours specified.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying these corrections to the function, it should now properly adjust the input `other` datetime to the nearest business hour based on the rules specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. This should resolve the frequency validation error seen in the failing test.
