### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the `self` object. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. The line where `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` is called is problematic because `next_bday` is not defined within the function scope.
2. There is a missing method `_get_closing_time` which is called but not defined within the function.
3. There is a missing method `_get_business_hours_by_sec` which is referenced but not defined within the function.
4. The line `if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):` is missing condition due to `is_on_offset` method being referenced which is not defined within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the function calling methods and attributes that are not defined within the function scope, leading to NameError exceptions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all required methods like `self._is_on_offset`, `self._next_opening_time`, `self._prev_opening_time`, `self._get_closing_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` are correctly defined within the function or imported from external modules.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:  # Updated line for missing condition
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

Please note that this corrected version assumes that the missing methods like `self._is_on_offset`, `self._next_opening_time`, `self._prev_opening_time`, `self._get_closing_time`, and `_get_business_hours_by_sec` are defined elsewhere in the code or imported correctly. Also, the condition `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` has been removed due to missing definition.
