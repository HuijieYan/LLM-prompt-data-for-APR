Upon analyzing the buggy function provided, the potential error locations are as follows:
1. The function tries to compare a datetime object with integers, which might cause unexpected behavior.
2. There are multiple conditionals that manipulate the datetime object 'other', which could lead to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is the incorrect manipulation of the 'other' datetime object, which leads to incorrect adjustments and calculations based on business hours.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to create a new datetime object to avoid mutating the original 'other' datetime object. Additionally, simplify the logic of adjusting by business days and remaining business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        modified_datetime = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond
        )

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        additional_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            additional_days, remaining_seconds = -additional_days, -remaining_seconds

        business_day_offset = timedelta(days=additional_days)

        if additional_days != 0:
            business_hour_remainder = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while business_hour_remainder > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(modified_datetime)
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                    business_hour_diff = closing_time - modified_datetime
                    
                    if business_hour_remainder < business_hour_diff:
                        modified_datetime += business_hour_remainder
                        business_hour_remainder = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        business_hour_remainder -= business_hour_diff
                        modified_datetime = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
            else:
                while business_hour_remainder > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(modified_datetime)
                    business_hour_diff = next_opening - modified_datetime
                    
                    if business_hour_remainder >= business_hour_diff:
                        modified_datetime += business_hour_remainder
                        business_hour_remainder = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        business_hour_remainder -= business_hour_diff
                        modified_datetime = next_opening

            modified_datetime += business_day_offset

        return modified_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, a new datetime object 'modified_datetime' is created to avoid altering the original 'other' datetime object. The logic for adjusting by business days and remaining business hours has been simplified and adjusted for correctness.
