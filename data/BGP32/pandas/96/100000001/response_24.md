The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified by the offset. The function incorrectly handles the case when the business hour adjustment results in moving to the next business day.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of negative business hours.
2. Improper calculation of remaining business hours.
3. Logic for adjusting to the next business day may not be accurate.
4. Potential issue with comparing timedelta values for equality.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from incorrect handling of negative business hours, flawed calculations of remaining business hours, and improper logic for adjusting to the next business day. These issues result in incorrect datetime adjustments when the business hour extends beyond the current business day.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic for handling negative business hours.
2. Refactor the calculations for remaining business hours.
3. Rework the logic for adjusting to the next business day.
4. Ensure proper comparison of timedelta values for accuracy in adjustments.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                previous_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if n >= 0:
                    other = next_opening + skip_bd
                else:
                    if other.time() >= self.start[0]:  # Check if the time is in the next day's range
                        other = next_opening + skip_bd
                    else:
                        other = previous_opening + skip_bd
                
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        Remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while Remain != timedelta(0):
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                closing_prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                business_time_remain = closing_time - other

                if business_time_remain <= Remain:
                    Remain -= business_time_remain
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_prev_opening)
                else:
                    other += Remain
                    Remain = timedelta(0)
                    
        else:
            while Remain != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                business_time_remain = next_opening - other

                if business_time_remain < Remain:
                    Remain -= business_time_remain
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                else:
                    other += Remain
                    Remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
1. The logic for adjusting negative business hours and moving to the next business day has been improved.
2. Proper calculations of remaining business hours have been ensured.
3. Refactored code to handle the adjustment of datetime based on business hours accurately.
