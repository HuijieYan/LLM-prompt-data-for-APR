### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is supposed to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The potential error locations in the function include:
   - Incorrect calculations when adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset.
   - Possible incorrect handling of edge cases involving the start and end times of business hours.
3. The bug in the function may stem from incorrect calculations and conditions while adjusting the datetime object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the datetime object is adjusted correctly based on the business hour offset, considering edge cases properly and handling both positive and negative offsets accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = r

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = 0
        else:
            while bhour_remain != 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the datetime object `other` based on the business hour offset `n` in a more accurate and edge-case-aware manner.
