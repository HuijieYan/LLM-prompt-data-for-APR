### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the input Offset object. The function calculates the business hours in a day, adjusts the input datetime object accordingly by business days, and then by remaining business hours.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. Missing import for `BusinessDay` class.
2. Incorrect check for midnight business hour.
3. Incorrect calculation for business hours in the `else` section.
4. Incorrect condition for finishing adjustments in the `else` section.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug in the code arises due to inaccurate handling of business days and business hours adjustments for negative offset values. The calculation for business days and business hours adjustments is incorrect, leading to incorrect results when adjusting the input datetime object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `BusinessDay` class to resolve the missing import issue.
2. Correct the logic for handling midnight business hour in the negative offset case.
3. Adjust the calculation for business hours in the `else` section to match the logic for the positive offset case.
4. Update the condition for finishing adjustments in the `else` section to ensure accurate adjustment of the datetime object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the calculation for adjusting business days and business hours for negative offsets has been adjusted to match the logic for positive offsets. Also, the condition for finishing adjustments in the negative offset case has been updated to ensure accurate adjustment of the input datetime object.
