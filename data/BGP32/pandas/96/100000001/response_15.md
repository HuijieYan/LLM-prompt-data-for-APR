## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given `datetime` object based on a specified business hour offset (`self`). It handles adjusting the datetime object to the next opening time, previous opening time, and closing time within the defined business hours. The bug may lie in the adjustment logic when processing negative offsets and the calculation of remaining business hours.

## Potential Error Locations:
- When adjusting for a negative offset, the logic to handle the remaining business hours may be incorrect.
- There might be a problem with the calculation of business hours to be skipped based on the offset.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from errors in the logic for adjusting a datetime object for negative offsets and the handling of remaining business hours. The incorrect calculation or comparison of business hours may lead to wrong adjustments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours to be skipped based on the offset (`n`).
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the datetime object when dealing with negative offsets.
3. Carefully consider the conditions for finishing the adjustment based on the remaining business hours.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for both positive and negative offsets have been refined. The logic for handling remaining business hours has been improved to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours.
