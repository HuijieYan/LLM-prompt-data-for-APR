### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on a business hour offset. The function contains multiple conditional branches and loops to handle different cases of adjusting the datetime depending on the business hour offset.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statement inside the `while` loop where `bhour_remain != timedelta(0)` might not properly handle all cases of adjustment.
2. The calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime within the business hours may have inaccuracies.
3. The adjustment logic for negative business hour offsets might need refinement.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function could be related to the logic within the conditional branches and loops, which might not cover all possible cases of adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset. This could lead to incorrect adjustments or potentially an infinite loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the conditional statements and loop conditions to ensure that they cover all cases of adjusting the datetime correctly for both positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Verify the calculations of business hours and make sure they are accurate to determine the correct adjustments.
3. Refine the logic for adjusting the datetime within the business hours to ensure it handles edge cases effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # Adjust the datetime based on business hour offset
        if n >= 0:
            while self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        if n < 0:
            while self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.start:
                # Move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

        # Calculate business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Skip business days
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I have simplified the adjustment logic to ensure correct datetime adjustments based on the business hour offset. This version focuses on properly handling both positive and negative business hour offsets and covers edge cases more effectively.
