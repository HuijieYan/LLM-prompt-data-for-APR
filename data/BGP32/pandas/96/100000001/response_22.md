### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to take a datetime object and adjust it based on a given business day offset. The function performs various calculations to adjust the datetime object by the specified offset. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause bugs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect usage of variables like `self.next_bday`, which raises uncertainty about whether it should be used.
2. Possible logic errors in the adjustment calculations based on positive and negative business day offsets.
3. Incorrect handling of business hours remaining after adjusting for business days.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function may arise from how the adjustments are being made based on the business day offset and remaining business hours. There might be logic errors causing the datetime object to be adjusted incorrectly, especially when handling negative business day offsets.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent and correct usage of variables within the function.
2. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative business day offsets.
3. Carefully handle the remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on business day offset
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[-1] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(days=1)

        # get total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = next_opening
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour_remain += bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

In the corrected version, the adjustments have been revised to ensure proper handling of positive and negative business day offsets and remaining business hours. Also, variable names like `next_opening` used consistently for clarity. Additionally, adjustments have been refined for more accurate handling of datetime object based on the business day offset.
