### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is designed to adjust a given datetime by a specified business hour offset `self.n`. It handles cases where `other` is a `datetime` object and performs various calculations to adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. Inconsistent method calls like `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` versus `self._is_on_offset`.
2. Use of `timedelta(seconds=1)` in calculations that might lead to inaccurate results.
3. Incorrect checking for whether the current time is on the business hour offset.
4. Potential issue in handling `nanosecond` attribute during adjustment.
5. The logic of adjusting the datetime based on the business hours might be flawed.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug in the function might be caused by incorrect handling of the business hours offset and the datetime adjustments, leading to inaccurate results when the datetime needs to be adjusted by a specific business hour offset.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Ensure consistency in method calls and attribute access.
2. Avoid rounding errors when performing timedelta calculations.
3. Properly check if the current time is on the business hour offset.
4. Carefully handle the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours.
5. Address potential issues with the `nanosecond` attribute during adjustments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_minutes = abs(n) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(minutes=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, potential errors have been addressed, including adjusting the datetime by the specified business hour offset properly. The corrected logic aims to accurately adjust the datetime based on the business hours provided.
