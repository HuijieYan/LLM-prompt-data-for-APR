## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on a given business hour offset. The function contains multiple conditional statements and calculations to adjust the datetime object accordingly.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `else` block in the initial conditional statement does not handle the case where `other` is a pandas `Timestamp`.
2. There are multiple calculations involving business hours and time intervals that may lead to incorrect adjustments.
3. Handling of business days and business hours within the while loops may cause issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function primarily stems from incorrect calculations and adjustments when handling business hours and time intervals. Additionally, the function does not fully consider the various edge cases that may arise during the adjustment process.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the calculations involving business days and business hours to ensure correct adjustments.
2. Handle edge cases more comprehensively, especially when transitioning between business days.
3. Ensure proper handling when `other` is a pandas `Timestamp`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime().replace(tzinfo=None)
            
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours_in_sec = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_in_sec // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._next_opening_time(other).date() == prev_open.date():
                other = prev_open + skip_bd
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- I have included a check to convert `pd.Timestamp` to `datetime` object to ensure consistency.
- Adjusted the handling of business days and business hours within the while loops to ensure accurate adjustments.
- Improved the check for transitioning between business days for proper date adjustments.
