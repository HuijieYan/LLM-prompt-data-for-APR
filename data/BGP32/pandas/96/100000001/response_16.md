### Analysis:
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `Timedelta` type in the calculation of business hours. The function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on the business hours defined by the offset object. However, there are inconsistencies in the calculation of remaining business hours and adjustments done using `Timedelta`.

### Error Locations:
1. In the section where business hour adjustments are made based on remaining time, there are issues with the logic related to calculating and deducting business hours.
2. Incorrect handling of business days adjustment (`skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)`) might result in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The incorrect handling of the calculations for the remaining business hours in both positive and negative offset scenarios results in the wrong adjustments being made to the input datetime object. This leads to the generated output being inaccurate and not aligned with the expected business hour offset.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the calculations for remaining business hours need to be revised, ensuring accurate adjustments based on the business hour intervals defined by the offset object. Additionally, the business days adjustment logic should be reviewed to guarantee correct adjustments for negative offsets as well.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        delta = timedelta(seconds=r * 60)

        while delta != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if n >= 0:
                delta = min(delta, bhour)
                other += delta
            else:
                delta = max(delta, -bhour)
                other -= abs(delta)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version focuses on fixing the calculation and adjustment logic for remaining business hours and business days. It addresses the bug by ensuring accurate adjustments based on the business hours defined by the offset object.
