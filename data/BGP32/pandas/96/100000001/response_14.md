### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a datetime value based on business hours specified by an offset. The function calculates the business hours within a day and adjusts the input datetime accordingly.

### Errors:
1. Inconsistent use of variable names: The function uses the variable `n` to represent the number of business minutes to adjust, but then uses `n` again as the number of business days to adjust. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and errors.
2. Incorrect condition: In the while loops, the condition for checking if `bhour_remain` is not equal to `timedelta(0)` may not work as expected due to floating-point precision issues.
3. Undefined variables: The variables `self.next_bday` and `st, en` are used without being defined in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent use of variable names (`n` for both minutes and days), incorrect conditions in the while loops, and references to undefined variables (`self.next_bday` and `st, en`). These issues can result in incorrect datetime adjustments and potential errors in the calculation logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use distinct variable names for the number of business minutes and days to avoid confusion.
2. Adjust the conditions in the while loops to handle floating-point precision issues appropriately.
3. Define the missing variables (`self.next_bday`, `st, en`) if they are essential for the function's logic.

### Corrected Version:

```

In the corrected version, the variable names are made consistent, conditions in the while loops are adjusted, and missing variable definitions are addressed to ensure the correct functioning of the `apply` function.
