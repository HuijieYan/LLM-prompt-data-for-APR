## Analysis:
The buggy function 'apply' is designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hour offsets. The function aims to handle cases where the input datetime falls outside the business hours defined by the 'self.start' and 'self.end' attributes.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison in conditions.
2. Improper calculation and adjustment of business days.
3. Insufficient handling of business hours within the time intervals.
4. Incorrect manipulation of datetime objects.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug likely stems from incorrect handling of business days adjustments and inaccurate business hour calculations. In the while loops, the comparison of business hours with the remaining time and the subsequent adjustments might be leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the adjustment of the datetime object 'other' is not accurately handled, possibly causing the function to output incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the conditions for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensure accurate tracking of business hours within the time intervals.
3. Correct the manipulation of datetime objects to reflect the intended adjustments accurately.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        total_business_hours = business_hours // 60

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.rollforward(other)
            if self.on_offset(other):
                other = self.apply_forward_business_day(other, bd)
            else:
                other = self.apply_backward_business_day(other, bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
1. The adjustment of business days is handled by different methods based on whether the current datetime is on the offset or not.
2. The calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours are fixed to ensure accurate adjustments within the time intervals.
3. Manipulation of datetime objects is revised to accurately reflect the adjustments based on business hours.
