1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours specified by the given Offset object. It calculates the business hours and adjusts the datetime object accordingly.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect handling of negative business hour adjustment.
- Potential issues with calculating and adjusting business hours.
- Conditions for moving to next/previous business time intervals may be flawed.
- Potential errors in adjusting for business days.

3. Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug in the function may arise from incorrect logic or conditions used for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. There may be issues with handling negative business hours and moving between different business time intervals.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative business hours.
- Verify the conditions for moving to next/previous business time intervals.
- Ensure accurate calculation and adjustment of business hours.
- Correctly handle the transition between different business days.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_seconds = n * 60 * 60
        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(total_seconds), businesshours)

        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds

        other += timedelta(days=business_days)

        while remaining_seconds != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                remaining_hours = (closing_time - other).total_seconds() / 3600
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remaining_hours = (opening_time - other).total_seconds() / 3600

            if n >= 0 and remaining_seconds > remaining_hours * 3600:
                other = closing_time
                remaining_seconds -= remaining_hours * 3600
            elif n < 0 and remaining_seconds < remaining_hours * 3600:
                other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                remaining_seconds = 0
            else:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses potential issues in adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and provides a more accurate implementation.
