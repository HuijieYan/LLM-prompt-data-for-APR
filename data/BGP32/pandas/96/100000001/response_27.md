### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to apply a business day offset to a given datetime object. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that might be causing unexpected behavior:
1. Incorrect logic in adjusting the business day offset and business hour offset.
2. Potential issues with calculating and adjusting business hours.
3. Handling of edge cases when adjusting the datetime object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is primarily caused by incorrect logic when adjusting the business day offset and business hour offset. There are cases where the function does not handle edge conditions properly, leading to incorrect calculations and adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly adjust the business day offset and business hour offset.
2. Properly calculate and adjust the business hours.
3. Handle edge cases when adjusting the datetime object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        if n >= 0:
            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r > bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments to the business day offset and business hour offset are handled correctly. Edge cases are also properly accounted for, ensuring the function works as expected.
