### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to calculate the adjusted time based on business hours given a `datetime` input. The function tries to adjust the input time by business days and business hours accordingly. However, there are several potential issues with the implementation that may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`) could lead to incorrect results, especially when `n` (number of minutes to adjust) is negative.
2. The adjustment of `other` within the loops based on business hours seems overcomplicated and could lead to incorrect results.
3. There are inconsistencies in the way `other` variable is adjusted in different parts of the code that may lead to logic errors.
4. The while loops for adjusting business hours can potentially cause an infinite loop if not properly handled.

### Bug Cause:
The complexity of the adjustment logic and the potential for incorrect adjustments based on business days and business hours lead to the bug in the function. The incorrect calculation of `bd` and `r` based on business hours could result in improper adjustments of the `other` datetime object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, simplify the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and days. Ensure that calculations for business days and remaining business hours are correct and lead to the desired adjusted datetime output without any unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on offset conditions
        if n >= 0:  # Add business hours
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:  # Subtract business hours
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of the input `other` datetime object has been simplified by directly iterating over the number of business hours to add or subtract. This approach ensures a more straightforward and correct adjustment based on business hour offsets.
