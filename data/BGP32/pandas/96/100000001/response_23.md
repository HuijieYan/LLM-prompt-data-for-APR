### Analysis:
1. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. The potential error locations within the function could be related to the handling of business hour adjustments and the logic for moving to the next or previous business day.
3. The bug in the current function seems to stem from incorrect calculation and adjustment of the business hour offsets, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting business hours, handling the transition to the next or previous business day, and ensure accurate calculation of the adjusted datetime object.

### Correction:

```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        n = self.n
        bd, r = divmod(n, businesshours // 60)

        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                other = self.start[0].apply(other)
                other = other.business_day(0)
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to the business hour calculations and handling of transitioning to the next or previous business day.
2. The function now calculates the number of business days and remaining business hours based on the provided offset `n`.
3. The logic for adjusting the datetime object with the calculated business days and remaining hours has been updated to ensure accurate adjustments.
4. The corrected version should now provide the expected behavior of adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offsets.
