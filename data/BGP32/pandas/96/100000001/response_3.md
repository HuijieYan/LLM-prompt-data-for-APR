## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function is designed to apply business hours adjustment to a given datetime. It checks if the input is a datetime, performs necessary adjustments based on business hours, and returns the adjusted datetime. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to undesired behavior.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The function might not correctly handle cases where the input datetime falls exactly on the offset start or end time.
2. There could be inaccuracies in calculating business hours and adjusting the datetime accordingly.
3. The logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours might have edge cases that are not handled properly.

## Cause of the bug:
The potential causes of the bug are related to the inaccurate handling of edge conditions for offset start and end times, incorrect calculation of business hours, and improper adjustments for business days and remaining hours.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles edge conditions, accurately calculates business hours, and properly adjusts the datetime for business days and remaining hours.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other if necessary based on the offset
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, I addressed the potential error locations by adjusting the logic for handling offset start and end times, accurately calculating business hours, and properly adjusting the datetime for business days and remaining hours.
