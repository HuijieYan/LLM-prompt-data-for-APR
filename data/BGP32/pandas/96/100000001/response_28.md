### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the Offset object. The function calculates the adjustment based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` seems to be incorrect as `next_bday` is not defined within the function.
2. The adjustment of business days and business hours may lead to incorrect results due to incorrect calculations.
3. The while loops for adjusting business hours need to be carefully evaluated to ensure correctness.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is mainly due to incorrect calculations during the adjustment of business days and business hours. Additionally, the check for `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` should be revised as it is not a valid attribute within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting business days and business hours to ensure accurate calculations.
2. Correct any references to undefined attributes like `self.next_bday`.
3. Verify the correctness of while loops for adjusting business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic for business days and business hours has been revised to eliminate potential errors, and references to undefined attributes have been removed.
