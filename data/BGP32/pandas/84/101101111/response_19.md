### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to unstack multiple levels of a MultiIndexed DataFrame. The bug results in a KeyError when attempting to access the level names during the unstacking process.

The problematic line is `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where `clocs` contains a tuple which represents the MultiIndex levels to unstack. The issue arises because the `_get_level_number` function expects a single level name but receives a tuple, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the level names are processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. We should ensure that if multiple levels need to be unstacked, we correctly handle the MultiIndex levels as tuples.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else list(index.names).index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

This fix ensures that if a tuple of levels is provided for unstacking, we correctly handle it by converting it to the corresponding indices in the MultiIndex names. This modification resolves the KeyError issue and allows the function to successfully unstack multiple levels of a MultiIndexed DataFrame.
