## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of multi-level indices when calling the `unstack` method. The issue stems from the assumption that the provided `level` parameter is a single integer when it can actually be a tuple representing multiple levels.

The primary problem lies in the function's attempt to convert the levels given as a tuple to their corresponding level numbers, but this conversion operation is incorrect in the current implementation. As a result, the function fails to properly handle hierarchical columns represented by MultiIndex objects.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, you need to update the conversion logic of the levels from a tuple to their respective level numbers. Additionally, you should account for the possibility of tuple-level input indicating multiple levels in the MultiIndex object.

You should modify the code to handle the tuple parameters correctly by identifying and extracting the level numbers based on the tuple values.

## Updated Corrected Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(l) for l in loc]
            clevels.extend(level_numbers)
        else:
            clevels.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(get_compressed_ids(index), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=[index.levels[i] if i in rlocs else np.arange(len(index.levels[i])) for i in range(index.nlevels)],
            codes=[index.codes[i] if i in rlocs else np.arange(len(index.codes[i])) for i in range(index.nlevels)],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in range(index.nlevels)],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles tuple-level input parameters, ensuring that the unstacking operation works correctly with MultiIndex objects containing multiple levels.
