## Understanding the Bug
The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels of columns based on the provided column locations. However, the bug causes the function to fail when the input contains tuple names within a MultiIndex. This issue is reported on GitHub as the function throws a KeyError due to the inability to handle tuple names properly.

## Bug Location
The bug revolves around the initialization of `clocs` within the function. The code attempts to retrieve the level number based on the input column locations, but when tuple names are present, it fails to handle them correctly.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function expects individual names for columns within a MultiIndex, but it is not equipped to handle tuple names like `('A', 'a')`. This leads to a mismatch in the expected format, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to find the level number for the column location containing tuple names.

## Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to update the way the function processes column locations with tuple names. We should modify the approach used to extract the level numbers to account for tuple names within MultiIndex columns.

## Updated `_unstack_multiple` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should address the bug and enable the unstacking of DataFrames with tuple names in MultiIndex columns:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By including a condition to check for tuple names and modifying the retrieval of level numbers accordingly, the corrected function is now able to handle MultiIndex columns with tuple names as input. This fix should resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
