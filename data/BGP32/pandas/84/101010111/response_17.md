## Bug Analysis:
The bug arises from the `_get_level_number` function in the `MultiIndex` class. When the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to retrieve the level number corresponding to a given name, it fails because the name is a tuple instead of a single level name. This causes the error messages "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" followed by "KeyError: 'Level A not found".

## Bug Location:
The bug can be located in the lines:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
where `i` in `clocs` is a tuple instead of a single name for a level.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_unstack_multiple` function is attempting to extract single level information, but a tuple of names is passed instead. The `_get_level_number` function expects a single level name and hence raises errors accordingly when it fails to find a match.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where tuples are used to specify the level names. These tuples need to be unpacked if they represent multiple levels. The fix should involve adjusting the code to handle nested levels from the level names passed in tuples.

## The Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    cloc_indices = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]
    rloc_indices = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rloc_indices]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rloc_indices]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rloc_indices]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Remaining function code...
```

This corrected version checks if the current element in `clocs` is a tuple and unpacks it to extract the level number accordingly. The fix addresses the root cause of the problem by handling multiple level names more effectively.
