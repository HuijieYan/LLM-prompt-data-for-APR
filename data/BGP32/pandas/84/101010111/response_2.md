### Bug Analysis
The main issue in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is the handling of the `clocs` parameter, which determines the level of columns to unstack when calling the unstack operation within the function. The bug is caused by how the function is analyzing and processing the column locations passed in for the unstack operation.

1. The original buggy function expects a tuple for `clocs`, even though it passes it as a list to `_get_level_number`.
2. The `index._get_level_number` call is expecting a single level value but receiving a tuple, leading to both `ValueError` and `KeyError`.
3. The error originates due to handling multi-index columns and mixing tuples within clocs, leading to incorrect handling of the levels in the subsequent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Extract each element from the tuple one by one and process it correctly in the subsequent operations.
2. Use a conditional check to handle whether the columns are multi-index or single index to avoid mismatched tuple extraction.
3. Avoid mixing levels and use clear separation and analysis based on the nature of the columns to prevent errors.

### Updated Function 

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Extract levels for columns from a tuple or a mix of tuple and single level
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        # If multiple levels, extract and process columns correctly
        clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        # If single level, convert to list for consistent handling
        clocs = [clocs]

    # Get column level numbers from the index
    cloc_nums = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_nums]

    # Remaining implementation remains the same as original function
    # ...
    # Keep the rest of the function code unchanged

    return unstacked
```

By updating the function in this manner, we ensure correct processing of the column levels and avoid the ValueError and KeyError encountered in the original implementation. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to handle multi-index column unstacking correctly.
