### Correction of the Buggy Function

After analyzing the bug and considering the expected values for the failing test cases, the root cause of the issue seems to be the incorrect processing of the passed `clocs` parameter in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the `clocs` parameter is handled appropriately with respect to MultiIndex objects. 

The bug arises from `clocs` not being correctly converted to index levels, causing the function to not identify the level 'A' in the MultiIndex during unstacking.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining implementation of the function
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version handles the case where `clocs` is passed either as a tuple or as a single level. The function should now correctly convert the names to level numbers when working with MultiIndex objects, resolving the KeyError issue.

This correction should address the bug based on the identified problem and the expected values from the failing test cases.
