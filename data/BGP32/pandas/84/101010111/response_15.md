### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to incorrect handling of the level parameter within the `clocs` list. The bug arises when passing a tuple as the level parameter, causing an error during the execution.

The error occurs in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The issue is that `i` within this list comprehension is expected to be the index in an integer format, but when passing a tuple as the level parameter, it results in a string type. This situation causes an exception when trying to access the level number using the `_get_level_number` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the `i` value within the list comprehension to ensure it's an integer before calling the `_get_level_number` method.
2. If `i` is a tuple, extract the actual level name from it and then pass that name to the `_get_level_number` method.
3. Handle the tuple correctly when multiple levels are involved.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with a fix for the bug:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making the modification above, the function should now correctly handle tuples passed as level parameters and avoid the KeyError or ValueError exceptions caused by invalid index access.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue where passing tuple names to `unstack` leads to an unhandled exception.
