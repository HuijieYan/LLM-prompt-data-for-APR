### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the input variable `clocs` in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function tries to get the level number of the provided `clocs` tuple which causes the error since the levels are tuples, not single levels.
  
2. The error message indicates that the function is failing to find the provided level in the list, resulting in a KeyError due to the mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic used to extract the level numbers in the function `_unstack_multiple`. Instead of directly using `index._get_level_number`, handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and extract level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Assume clocs is a tuple if it has more than one element
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = tuple(index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]  # Single level provided

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle both single levels and tuple levels provided as input, resolving the KeyError issue.
