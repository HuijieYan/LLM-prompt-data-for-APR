### Analysis:
The issue arises from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. Specifically, the problem is occurring due to how the function handles multi-index data when the unstack operation is performed with tuple names. The function fails to correctly identify or handle levels in multi-indexes, resulting in a KeyError.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is when the function tries to map the columns of the input data to their corresponding indexes. Specifically, the line that extracts level numbers from the multi-index columns using `index._get_level_number(i)` might be causing the KeyError when handling tuple names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function doesn't correctly handle multi-index columns with tuple names. When trying to extract level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`, it expects `i` to be a string representing the level name. However, in the case of tuple names like `('A', 'a')`, it fails to identify the correct level number leading to a KeyError.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by handling tuple names appropriately in multi-index data structures. Instead of directly trying to extract level numbers using `_get_level_number`, the function should handle tuple names as tuples rather than strings.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    current_names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    clocs = [(current_names.index(val) if isinstance(val, tuple) else val) for val in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function now handles multi-index columns with tuple names efficiently. By properly identifying levels in multi-index structures and addressing the issue of KeyError when encountering tuple names, the function has been updated to resolve the bug that was described in the GitHub issue.
