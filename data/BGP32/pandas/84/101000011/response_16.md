### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series. The bug seems to be related to the handling of hierarchical column indexes during the unstacking operation. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where unstacking fails when tuple names are passed as the `level` argument.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line tries to get the level number for each specified level in `clocs`. The bug may be related to how the column levels are being handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` method is not able to correctly identify levels in the MultiIndex, especially when tuple names are used. This leads to a KeyError indicating that the specified level is not found. The function doesn't correctly handle hierarchical column indexes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the levels in the MultiIndex, especially when dealing with tuple names as column indexes. It may involve modifications in the way column levels are processed and accessed.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (int, str)) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

In the corrected version, we reassign `level_numbers` based on whether the `clocs` element is an integer/string or a tuple. This change should ensure that the correct level numbers are obtained for further processing. This modification should address the issue of unstacking failures when tuple names are encountered.
