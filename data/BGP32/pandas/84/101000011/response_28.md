### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is called by the `unstack` function in the `reshape.py` file of the `pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub states that when trying to unstack a Series with tuple names, it fails with a `KeyError`. This failure is caused by the mishandling of tuple names in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the `_unstack_multiple` function are:
1. Incorrect handling of tuple names in `clocs`.
2. Incorrect calculation of `rlocs`.
3. Inadequate handling of case when `rlocs` is empty.
4. Improper reindexing of DataFrame after unstacking.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect handling of tuple names in the `clocs` list. When tuple names are passed, they are not properly translated into index levels, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how tuple names are processed in the `clocs` list and how the index is reconstructed after unstacking. Additionally, we need to consider edge cases like when `rlocs` is empty.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]  # Handle tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected version, the bug related to unstacking a Series with tuple names should be resolved.
