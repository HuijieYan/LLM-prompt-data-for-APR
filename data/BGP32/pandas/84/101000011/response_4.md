### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling unstacking operations with MultiIndexed data. The issue arises when there are tuple names in the MultiIndex and attempting to unstack based on these tuple names. The bug results in a KeyError indicating that the level is not found due to the way the function `index._get_level_number(i)` is being used.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `index._get_level_number(i)` with tuple names can lead to a KeyError when the tuple name is not found in the Index names.
2. Handling of multiple levels and corresponding codes may not be aligning correctly in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to get the level number for tuple names ('A', 'a') directly, which is not present in the Index names list. This problem arises when dealing with MultiIndexed data with tuple names and unstacking based on those tuple names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the levels are handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly retrieve the level numbers for tuple names. This can involve considering the tuple names as a whole when extracting level information.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version includes a modification in extracting level numbers where we check if the `clocs` item is a tuple and handle it accordingly. This change should address the KeyError issue related to unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndexed data structures.
