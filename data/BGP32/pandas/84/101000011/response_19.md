### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing a `KeyError` while trying to unstack a MultiIndexed DataFrame with tuple names. The issue arises when trying to obtain the level number for a certain name. The bug seems to be related to identifying the correct level number for a tuple name in a MultiIndex.

### Identified Issue:
The root cause of the bug seems to be that the function `_get_level_number` is not handling tuple names correctly when trying to determine the level number for a particular name. This results in a `KeyError` for tuple names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, modify the `_get_level_number` method to properly handle tuple names when determining the level number. This modification should allow for correct unstacking even with tuple names in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix in `_get_level_number`:
```python
# Modify the _get_level_number method in the pandas/core/indexes/multi.py file
def _get_level_number(self, level):
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        return tuple(self.names).index(level)
    else:
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(level))
```

### Corrected Version of `_unstack_multiple`:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By modifying the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly, the `KeyError` issue while unstacking MultiIndexed DataFrames with tuple names should be resolved.
