### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering an issue when unstacking multi-indexed data with tuple names. The key error `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` indicates that the function is unable to locate the specified level within the multi-index. This is likely due to how the levels are handled within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of clocs (column locations) and rlocs (remaining locations).
2. Extraction of names, levels, and codes for columns and rows.
3. Setting up the dummy MultiIndex.
4. Adjustment and unstacking of the data for different data types.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from how the levels are being processed and handled within the function. The function fails to properly identify the specified levels ('A', 'a') in the multi-index during unstacking, resulting in the KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the levels are correctly identified and manipulated during the unstacking process. We need to adjust the handling of levels, names, codes, and create a proper MultiIndex that contains the expected data structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue with multi-indexed unstacking:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clev_names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlev_names = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, [len(x) for x in clevels], sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, [len(x) for x in clevels], ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rlev_names + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(-1, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = clev_names
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(-1, fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            new_levels = [unstacked.index.levels[-1]] + clevels
            new_names = [data.name] + clev_names
            new_codes = [unstacked.index.codes[-1]]
            for rec in recons_codes:
                new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.index.codes[-1]))
        else:
            new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[-1]] + clevels
            new_names = [unstacked.columns.names[-1]] + clev_names
            new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[-1]]
            for rec in recons_codes:
                new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version adjusts how the levels, names, and codes are handled, ensuring that the specified levels are correctly located in the multi-index during unstacking.
