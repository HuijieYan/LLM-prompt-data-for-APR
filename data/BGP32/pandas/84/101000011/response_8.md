### Analysis:
1. The `unstack` function is calling the `_unstack_multiple` function with the `level` parameter, but the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle the case where the `level` parameter is a tuple of names for MultiIndex columns.
2. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to get the level number for the column names using `._get_level_number` method, which results in an error when the level name is a tuple.
3. The GitHub issue provides an example where unstacking a Series with MultiIndex columns using a tuple name fails with a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle the case when `level` is a tuple of names for MultiIndex columns. The function expects a list of level numbers to unstack upon, which doesn't work when passed a tuple of names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `level` is a tuple of names for MultiIndex columns. We should convert the tuple of names to the corresponding level numbers before further processing in the function.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple of names to level numbers
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By adding the conversion logic to handle the case where `level` is a tuple of names, the function will now correctly process MultiIndex columns with tuple names, resolving the KeyError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
