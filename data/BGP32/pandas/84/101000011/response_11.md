### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling the unstacking operation on MultiIndexed data within a DataFrame or Series in Pandas. The function has an issue in the way it calculates and processes the column locations (`clocs`) which leads to the KeyError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when trying to convert the identifiers used to indicate the levels of the MultiIndex columns to their corresponding level numbers within the index object. Specifically, this line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is the point where the error is triggered.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the function not handling tuple names correctly when trying to resolve them into level numbers, which leads to `KeyError` indicating that the specified level is not found.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to be able to handle tuple names correctly and convert them into valid level numbers for MultiIndexed columns.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # Convert specified column locations into level numbers correctly
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    # Get the remaining index levels
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
}
```

### Summary:
By correctly handling tuple names and converting them into valid level numbers when processing MultiIndexed columns, the bug causing the KeyError should be fixed. This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
