### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling multi-indexes and is called when unstacking using the `unstack` method. The reported issue on GitHub highlights a specific scenario when unstacking with tuple names fails with a `KeyError`.

### Error Location:
The key error arises in the `_get_level_number` method of the `Index` class when attempting to find the level number based on the provided tuples. The code is expecting a single level name as a string, not a tuple.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code attempts to find the level number using a tuple (`('A', 'a')`) which does not match a single level name in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, the code needs to handle the scenario where a tuple of names is passed as the level parameter instead of a single level name. We can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to accommodate this case and extract the level numbers correctly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # No need to modify this code path as it's not related to the reported GitHub issue

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.extend([index._get_level_number(lvl) for lvl in loc])
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
``` 

This fix enables the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both single level names and tuples of level names correctly.
