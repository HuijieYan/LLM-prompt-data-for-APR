### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the functionality of unstacking hierarchical indexes in Pandas, as referenced by the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The error occurs when attempting to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex using tuple names, resulting in a KeyError.

### Potential Error Location
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to extract the level numbers based on the given column locations. The error location is likely in the following code snippet:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is responsible for converting the tuple names to their corresponding level numbers, which might result in a KeyError if the tuple name is not found in the index.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the way the function `_unstack_multiple` handles the extraction of level numbers from column locations provided as tuple names. In cases where the tuple names are not directly present as level names in the index, it raises a KeyError due to the use of `index._get_level_number(i)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way level numbers are extracted from the column locations. We should handle the case where the given column locations are tuple names and convert them intelligently to level numbers to avoid KeyError. This could involve iterating over the names and getting level numbers intelligently.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that handles the conversion from tuple names to level numbers more robustly:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code as is
```

By adding a check to handle tuples intelligently in the `clocs` list, we can prevent the KeyError issue that arises when trying to directly get level numbers from tuple names. This modification should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
