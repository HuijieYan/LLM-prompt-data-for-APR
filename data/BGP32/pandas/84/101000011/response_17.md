### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of a DataFrame with multiple indices.
- The GitHub issue describes an error that arises when attempting to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex using tuple names, resulting in a KeyError.
- The KeyError occurs due to the `_get_level_number` method trying to resolve the levels based on string names, which leads to an error when tuple names are passed during unstacking.
- The root cause of the bug lies in how the function tries to identify the level based on the names provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_unstack_multiple` trying to use string names to identify levels in the index when dealing with MultiIndex data, resulting in a KeyError if tuple names are passed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to correctly handle MultiIndex levels with tuple names. Instead of directly trying to match string names, the code should consider the types of names provided in the levels. We can maintain compatibility with existing functionality while ensuring proper handling of tuple names.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version with the fix included:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

### Summary:
By modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names in MultiIndex levels properly, we have addressed the KeyError issue identified in the GitHub report. The corrected version should now work as expected when unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex containing tuple names.
