### Analysis:
This bug is related to the handling of MultiIndexed data where the column names are tuples. The issue arises when attempting to unstack a column with a tuple name, resulting in a KeyError.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` where `i` represents the column levels. This operation fails when the columns have tuple names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the assumption that column names in the MultiIndex are simple strings, leading to a KeyError when trying to get the level number for tuple names. The function does not account for this scenario and fails when tuple names are encountered.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndexed data with tuple column names correctly. It involves updating the code to account for tuple names while retrieving level numbers to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with the necessary changes to handle tuple column names appropriately:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we check if `i` is a tuple in the `clocs` list and handle it appropriately during level number retrieval to prevent the KeyError. This modification ensures compatibility with MultiIndexed data having tuple column names.
