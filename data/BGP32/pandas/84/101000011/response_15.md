### Bug Analysis and Fix

#### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from a mismatch in the way it handles the levels in the index. The function needs to convert the level names to their corresponding level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method. However, in the buggy section, when the level names are provided as a tuple (like ('A', 'a')), it causes an error because the function expects single level names, not tuples.

#### Bug Cause:
The `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` is due to the fact that the `_get_level_number` method in `pandas` expects single level names, not tuples. The bug occurs when trying to unstack a Series with MultiIndex and providing a tuple of level names to unstack, causing an issue in converting tuple names to individual level names.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the scenario where the `clocs` parameter contains tuples of level names. We should split the tuple elements and then get the corresponding level numbers.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By modifying the line where the `clocs` list comprehension occurs to handle tuples by extracting the first element of each tuple, our corrected function should now be able to correctly get the level numbers for unstacking, resolving the KeyError issue.
