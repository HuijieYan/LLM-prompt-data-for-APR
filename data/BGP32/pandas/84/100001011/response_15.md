### Bug Analysis:
The bug arises from the function `_unstack_multiple` failing to handle hierarchical columns (`MultiIndex`) properly. It tries to unstack the data based on the provided `clocs` values, which are supposed to represent the levels of the columns in the MultiIndex. However, due to inconsistent handling of levels, the function encounters issues with the column selection.

In the provided case, the usage of tuple names for the MultiIndex columns (`[('A', 'a'), ('B', 'b')]`) triggers the bug as the function doesn't correctly identify the levels based on these names. This leads to an inability to unstack the data properly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, the function needs to properly recognize the levels of the MultiIndex columns using the provided tuple names. Consequently, the unstacking process should proceed accurately based on these identified levels to avoid any errors.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correctly identify the levels based on the tuple names in clocs
    clevel = data.columns.get_level_values(clocs)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevel, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevel, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function now uses the `get_level_values` method to retrieve the levels based on the column tuple names in `clocs`. The unstacking process is then conducted using these identified levels, ensuring the correct handling of the MultiIndex columns.
