### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `_unstack_multiple` function encounters a KeyError when trying to get the level number for columns in a MultiIndex. The issue arises from the fact that the function is expecting column names to be passed in the form of tuples, while the existing implementation works with single-level column indexes.

### Bug Location
The bug originates from the attempt to extract the level number in the column index using the `_get_level_number` method without handling the case of MultiIndex columns correctly. This causes the function to fail when trying to access level names when expecting a single-level index.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the function expecting a single level index but receiving multi-level indexes for columns, as seen in the GitHub issue description. When trying to extract the level numbers, it encounters a KeyError because of the mismatch in the column index levels and the expected single-level treatment.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to update the function `_unstack_multiple` to handle MultiIndex columns correctly. We should detect when dealing with MultiIndex columns and modify the extraction of level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the index type (MultiIndex or single-level Index)
    index = data.index
    is_multi_index = isinstance(index, MultiIndex)

    # Extract level numbers based on whether it's a MultiIndex or not
    if is_multi_index:
        clocs = [index.get_loc_level(i)[0] for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function now checks if the index is MultiIndex and extracts the level numbers accordingly. This modification ensures that the function handles both single-level and multi-level indexes correctly, resolving the KeyError issue seen in the GitHub bug report.
