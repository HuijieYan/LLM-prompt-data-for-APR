### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the _unstack_multiple function due to the indexing of levels in MultiIndex. The function is designed to handle multiple indexing scenarios, but it currently fails to properly deal with tuple names of hierarchical columns, as seen in the GitHub issue. The issue stems from the incorrect handling of tuple names passed as levels when unstacking the data.

### Bug Location:
The key issue arises in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line incorrectly assumes that the tuple values in clocs are the direct levels of the index. It should correctly handle tuple names and extract the levels accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly identifying tuple names in clocs when accessing the levels information. This leads to a KeyError later in the process, preventing successful unstacking of the data with tuple names as levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to distinguish between direct levels and tuple names in clocs. If a tuple name exists in clocs, we need to handle it differently to extract the correct levels. By modifying the logic to differentiate between levels and tuple names, we can address the KeyError issue and correctly unstack the data with tuple names as levels.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(level="__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(level="__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function now properly handles tuple names in clocs when determining the levels to unstack the data, ensuring that the data with tuple names as levels can be unstacked successfully without encountering KeyError issues.
