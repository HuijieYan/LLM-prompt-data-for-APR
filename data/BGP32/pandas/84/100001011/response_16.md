### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the improper handling of hierarchical columns. The function attempts to transform a DataFrame with a `MultiIndex` into an unstacked form, but encounters issues with identifying and processing the levels and codes of the `MultiIndex`.

### Error Location:
The key error is raised at the line where the function tries to retrieve the level number from the index using `index._get_level_number(i)`. In this context, the function fails to handle tuple names such as `('A', 'a')`, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_unstack_multiple` doesn't support the unstack operation for MultiIndexes with tuple-type names ('A', 'a'), which is evident from the ValueError encountered during the unstack operation in the provided GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple-type names. This involves updating the approach to extract level numbers and properly unstacking the MultiIndex to handle hierarchical columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the numerical levels from the Tuple labels
    levels = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            level_names = [name for name in cloc]
            loc_level = data.columns.names.index(level_names)
            levels.append(loc_level)
        else:
            levels.append(cloc)

    result = data
    for level in levels:
        result = result.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

This corrected version takes into account the possibility of tuple-type names in the column levels and correctly handles the unstacking operation for MultiIndexes with such hierarchical columns.
