### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_unstack_multiple` is given a tuple of levels (`clocs`) to unstack. The bug originates from the code's assumption that `clocs` is a list of level indices, but in the case of unstacking by tuples, it receives a tuple instead. This leads to an error when trying to retrieve the level number from the index.

The issues observed:
1. The bug arises from incorrect handling of `clocs` when it's a tuple instead of a list.
2. The function doesn't account for unstacking by tuple names, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the way `clocs` is handled when it contains tuple names. We should identify the level numbers corresponding to the tuple names and then continue with the unstacking process. Additionally, the conditions for unstacking by tuple names should be factored in. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correct the handling of the input tuple for column levels
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        col_levels = [data.columns.names.index(names) for names in clocs]
    else:
        col_levels = clocs

    # Continue with the original logic for unstacking
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in col_levels]

    # Remaining code...
```

By introducing a condition to properly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of column names, we ensure that the correct level numbers are obtained. This adjustment should fix the key error and enable unstacking by tuple names as intended.
