### Bug Analysis:
The bug revolves around the function `_unstack_multiple` when handling MultiIndex columns, specifically when trying to unstack multiple levels simultaneously. The issue arises from converting the level names provided as tuples into level numbers.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the following section of the code:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is attempting to convert level names (`clocs`) into level numbers.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the input `clocs` is expected as level names that need to be converted to corresponding level numbers using `_get_level_number`. However, the current implementation does not support the input of level names in the form of tuples, leading to a KeyError.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the input `clocs` to ensure it contains only level names.
2. Process the input `clocs` as level names directly without attempting to convert them into level numbers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index.names[i] not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[index.names.index(name)] for name in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index.names.index(name)] for name in clocs]
    cnames = clocs
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

This correction directly uses the level names in `clocs` without converting them to level numbers, addressing the KeyError issue that was encountered in the GitHub bug report mentioned.
