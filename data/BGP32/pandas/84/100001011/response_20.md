### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect usage of level names in the unstacking process. The function tries to use the level names directly in the unstacking operations, resulting in a KeyError when the level names are not found in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle MultiIndexes correctly, considering the level numbers instead of level names. Additionally, the function should differentiate between the cases where the input `clocs` is a tuple of multi-level names and when it contains level numbers for unstacking.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index
    
    if all(isinstance(i, str) for i in clocs):
        # If clocs contains level names
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = list(clocs)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Proceed with the remaining code unchanged
    # ...
```

By modifying the function to handle the type of `clocs` appropriately and ensuring level numbers are used for unstacking operations, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
