The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to an issue with handling the levels correctly in the context of a MultiIndexed DataFrame. The function is not properly identifying the level numbers when passed tuple names like `('A', 'a')`, leading to a KeyError during unstacking.

### Bug Analysis:
The function is designed to handle unstacking operations on DataFrame or Series objects. The issue is spotted when trying to unstack by passing a tuple name `(level0, level1)` as an argument, and the function fails to correctly interpret and process these names. The error occurs when trying to convert the tuple of names into level numbers to work with the MultiIndex structure.

### Bug Location:
The problematic part of the code is within the `_unstack_multiple` function when converting the column locations (clocs) passed as tuples into actual level numbers in the index. This conversion is essential for further processing and unstacking operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling MultiIndex levels when the column locations are passed as tuple names, such as `('A', 'a')`. The code attempts to use `_get_level_number` method to convert these tuple names into level numbers, but it fails to do so correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Proposed Fix:
To address this issue, we need to modify the code to properly handle the tuple names when converting them into level numbers. Instead of relying only on the index `_get_level_number` function, we can manually map the tuple names to the corresponding levels to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(c) if c in index.names else index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function follows...
```

In the corrected version, we handle tuple names in `clocs` by checking if they are directly present in `index.names`. If they are present, we use the index of that name; if not, we try to get the level number as before. This modification allows the function to correctly convert tuple names into level numbers, ensuring the unstacking operation proceeds smoothly.
