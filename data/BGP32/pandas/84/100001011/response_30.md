### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack multiple levels in the index of a DataFrame or Series. The provided case involves unstacking with a tuple of names as the levels. The bug manifests when converting the tuple of column names into their corresponding level numbers due to the presence of hierarchical (MultiIndex) columns, causing a KeyError due to the mismatch between the expected and actual level names.

### Error Location
The key error is likely arising in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that all indexes are at the same level, ignoring the potential for hierarchical levels. As a result, it fails to extract the correct level numbers for the provided column names in the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if the provided `clocs` correspond to MultiIndex levels.
- Handle the hierarchical nature of indexes by mapping the provided column names to their respective levels correctly.
- Update the function to accommodate MultiIndex columns while extracting level numbers.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get column index if column names are provided
    def get_level_number(column_names):
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            levels = data.columns.names
            return [levels.index(name) for name in column_names]
        return [data.columns.get_loc(name) for name in column_names]

    index = data.index

    clocs = get_level_number(clocs)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By introducing a helper function (`get_level_number`) to handle column name mapping to level number extraction in both single and MultiIndex cases, the corrected function should resolve the KeyError issue reported on GitHub.
