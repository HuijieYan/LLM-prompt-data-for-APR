### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function while handling multi-index columns. Specifically, when dealing with tuples as column names, the function fails to correctly extract the level numbers from the index, leading to a `KeyError`. The bug is associated with identifying the level number corresponding to a given level name, especially when the column names are represented as tuples.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly maps the level names to their corresponding level numbers. This involves enhancing the extraction and matching process to accommodate tuples as the column names. By modifying how the level numbers are extracted from the index and handling tuple names appropriately, we can resolve the `KeyError` experienced when unstacking columns with tuple names.

### Bug Fix in `_unstack_multiple`:
Here is the revised version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(cloc)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This fix incorporates handling tuple names correctly when extracting the level numbers and ensures that the unstacking operation for multi-indexed columns with tuples as names proceeds without encountering a `KeyError`.
