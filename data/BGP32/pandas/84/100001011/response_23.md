### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to unstack multiple levels with hierarchical columns. The issue arises when identifying the level number based on the provided tuple names (`clocs`) for stacking. The code fails to correctly handle the tuple names and throws a `KeyError` when attempting to get the level number from the index.

### Bug Location:
The specific error occurs in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
Where `index._get_level_number(i)` fails to handle tuple names properly, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of tuple names when trying to retrieve the level number, resulting in a `KeyError`. This leads to the failure to process hierarchical columns correctly, as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle tuple names and retrieve the corresponding level number. The fix involves adjusting how tuple names are processed and handled to avoid the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical column names
    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By using `index.get_loc(i)` instead of `_get_level_number(i)`, we can accurately identify the levels based on tuple names, resolving the `KeyError` issue. This adjustment ensures correct handling of hierarchical columns with tuple names during unstacking operations.
