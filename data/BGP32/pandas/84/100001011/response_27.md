### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to unstack a DataFrame with multi-level column names using a tuple of names. The key error `'Level A not found'` indicates that the function is trying to access a level that doesn't exist, leading to a KeyError.

### Issue in the Buggy Function:
The issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `clocs` variable is used to extract the column locations to work with. The error occurs during the transformation process, specifically in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The script tries to get the level number of the column names passed as a tuple, resulting in the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the level numbers for the columns are extracted. We should extract the level numbers for the multi-level column names and handle hierarchical columns properly.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `clocs` value is a tuple before extracting the level numbers from the index. If it is a tuple, we extract the level number; otherwise, we assume it's already a level number and include it as is.

This change should fix the bug related to unstacking with tuple names in the presence of multi-level columns.
