### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_level_number` is called with a value that is a tuple instead of a single level name. This causes the function to throw an error, leading to the failure of the test cases. 

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `clocs` parameter is a single level name instead of a tuple. To achieve this, we can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle this situation by extracting the single level name from the tuple before passing it to `_get_level_number`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extracting the level name from the single-item tuple
    level_name = clocs if isinstance(clocs, str) else clocs[0]

    # Rest of the function remains the same as original
    # ...
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level_name)]
    # ...
```

This modification ensures that the input `clocs` is treated as a single level name by extracting it from the tuple if needed.

By making this change, the function should be able to handle the input correctly and pass the failing test cases.
