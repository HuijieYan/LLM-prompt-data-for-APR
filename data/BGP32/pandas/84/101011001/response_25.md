### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the `level` parameter passed to the `_get_level_number` method in the `index` object is a tuple `(A, a)` in the first test case and a string `'A'` in the second test case. The `_get_level_number` method only expects a single string level as input, so when it receives a tuple in the first case, it raises a `ValueError`, and in the second case, it raises a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify and extract the correct `level` value from the `clocs` tuple before passing it to the `_get_level_number` method.
2. Handle the case where the extracted `level` may be either a string or a tuple with just a single level name.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level[0] if isinstance(level, tuple) else level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By extracting the correct level from the `clocs` tuple before passing it to `_get_level_number` ensures that the function runs correctly in both cases where the `level` is either a string or a tuple with a single level.
