### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `_get_level_number` method, which is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error that arises is due to the code treating the level as a tuple, which causes the method to throw a `KeyError`. The method expects a string level name, not a tuple.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in such a way that it handles tuple levels correctly. We can change the approach to extract the level number. We can use the tuple as input and process it accordingly to get the correct level number.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        cloc_number = None
        for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
            if isinstance(name, tuple) and name == cloc:
                cloc_number = i
                break
        if cloc_number is None:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {cloc} not found")
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function...
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle tuple levels and extract the correct level numbers as needed.
