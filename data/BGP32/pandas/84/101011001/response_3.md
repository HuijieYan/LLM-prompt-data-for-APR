### Bug Explanation
In the `_unstack_multiple` function, the bug is caused by the attempt to get the level number of a multi-index column label that is a tuple. The buggy line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is trying to get the level number for each column location specified in `clocs`, where `clocs` contains the column labels that need to be unstacked.

The issue arises from comparing the tuple label with the single level name in the multi-index. When the function tries to convert the tuple label `('A', 'a')` into a level number, it fails because it is not directly present in the list of level names. This results in either a `ValueError` or a `KeyError` depending on the exact context.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we extract the level number from the column label. Instead of comparing the entire tuple label directly, we should extract each individual level name from the tuple and compare it with the level names present in the multi-index.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = [loc if isinstance(loc, tuple) else (loc,) for loc in clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for loc in cloc_levels for level in loc]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version ensures that each column location specified in `clocs` is correctly mapped to its corresponding level number in the multi-index, even if the column label is a tuple. This modification resolves the bug and should now pass the failing tests.
