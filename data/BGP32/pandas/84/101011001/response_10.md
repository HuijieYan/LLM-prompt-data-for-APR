### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_level_number` is expecting a single level name as input, but the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is passing a tuple of multiple level names (`clocs`) to it. This causes the function to try to find a tuple name in the list of level names, leading to errors like KeyError.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only single level names are passed to `_get_level_number` function. We can modify the code in `_unstack_multiple` to iterate over each item in the `clocs` tuple and call `_get_level_number` individually for each item. This way, we can avoid passing tuples to `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    
    # Modify the line below to handle multiple level names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By individually calling `_get_level_number` for each item in the `clocs` tuple, we ensure that only single level names are passed to the function, fixing the bug related to KeyError.
