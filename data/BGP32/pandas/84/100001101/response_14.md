### Bug analysis
The bug arises from incorrect handling of the multiple levels in the index. The function `_unstack_multiple` fails to correctly identify the column levels and codes related to the unstacking process when dealing with hierarchical columns. This results in misalignment of the new levels and codes for the unstacked DataFrame.

### Bug location
The issue arises in the part of the code where the new levels, names, and codes are being constructed for the unstacked DataFrame. The logic to determine these attributes based on the recons_codes is flawed, leading to incorrect column organization.

### Bug explanation
- In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the input hierarchical columns ('A', 'a') and 'B'.
- The function incorrectly constructs the new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame, resulting in misaligned columns.
- This misalignment can be observed from the discrepancies in the actual unstacked DataFrame compared to the expected unstacked DataFrame.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the new levels, names, and codes are calculated correctly based on the recons_codes derived from the group index compression. The correct alignment of the columns in the unstacked DataFrame is crucial for correct unstacking of the data.

### Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + [Index(obs_ids, name='__placeholder__')]
        new_names = cnames + ['__placeholder__']
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = rlevels + [Index(obs_ids, name='__placeholder__')]
        new_names = rnames + ['__placeholder__']
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By correctly adjusting the construction of new levels, names, and codes based on the recons_codes, the unstacked DataFrame will align with the expected output, resolving the bug.
