### Bug Analysis

The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` is due to incorrect handling of the column levels during the unstacking operation. The function is designed to unstack data from a DataFrame based on the given columns, but there are issues in reconstructing the new column levels and codes. This results in incorrect indexing and column naming.

The specific issues identified are:
1. Inconsistencies in handling hierarchical column levels.
2. Incorrect assignment of new column levels, names, and codes.
3. Missing reindexing operations for unstacked data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Ensure proper handling of hierarchical column levels.
2. Correctly assign new column levels, names, and codes.
3. Update the indexing of unstacked data appropriately.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids]
        new_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"]
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids] + clevels
        new_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"] + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids] + recons_codes

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_codes, names=new_names)
    else:
        unstacked.columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_codes, names=new_names)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version ensures accurate reconstruction of column levels, names, and codes during unstacking operation, resolving the issues identified in the bug analysis.
