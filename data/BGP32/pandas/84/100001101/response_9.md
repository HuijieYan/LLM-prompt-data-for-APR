The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` arises from the incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter, leading to unexpected behavior during the processing of indices and columns. To fix this issue, we should modify how the `clocs` parameter is processed to correctly unstack the data.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the following error:
1. The `clocs` parameter is incorrectly processed as a tuple containing a tuple and a string, causing issues when trying to identify the level numbers to unstack.
2. This results in incorrect manipulation of the indices and columns, leading to unexpected results in the unstacked data.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the processing of the `clocs` parameter by ensuring that it is correctly identified as a tuple of level identifiers.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the `clocs` correctly when handling index and column transformations.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process clocs as a tuple
    if not isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (clocs,)  # Convert single level input to tuple

    clevel_numbers = [data.columns.get_loc(level) for level in clocs]

    rlevel_numbers = [data.columns.get_loc(level) for level in data.columns if level not in clocs]

    clevels = [data.columns.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [data.columns.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [data.columns.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [data.columns.levels[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rcodes = [data.columns.codes[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rnames = [data.columns.names[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

By correcting the processing of the `clocs` parameter and adjusting the logic accordingly, this revised function should now handle unstacking multiple levels correctly based on the specified `clocs`.
