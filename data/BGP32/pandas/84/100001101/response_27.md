The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to improper handling of hierarchical columns and incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame. The function fails to correctly unstack the data when dealing with multiple levels of columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic and ensure proper reshaping of the DataFrame. Based on the provided expected cases, it seems that the function should unstack the data while preserving the hierarchical structure of columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers for column unstacking
    cloc_levels = [data.columns.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    # Unstack the DataFrame
    unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_levels)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version simplifies the unstacking process by directly using the `unstack` method of the DataFrame without explicitly handling the complexities that were causing the bug.

By utilizing the level numbers in `clocs` to unstack the DataFrame along those levels, we can ensure the hierarchical structure of the columns is maintained correctly.

Please test this corrected function with the provided test cases to ensure it behaves as expected and resolves the bug.
