### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to unstack a DataFrame based on certain column locations specified by `clocs`. It handles different cases based on the input data structure and column levels. The function aims to modify the index and stack the data accordingly.

### Issues:
1. In Case 1, the bug is observed when attempting to place the new columns in the wrong position, resulting in incorrect column ordering.
2. In Case 2, the function doesn't accurately handle the multi-index structure, leading to misalignment in the unstacked result.
3. In Case 3, the function fails to properly update the new column levels and codes due to incorrect handling of multi-level index columns.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reorganize the logic that computes the new columns and their relationships to ensure correct ordering.
2. Adjust the handling of multi-index columns to properly align with the expected structure.
3. Update the processing of new column levels and codes to accurately reflect the changes made during unstacking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=ccodes + [comp_ids],
        names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should now address the issues observed in the buggy implementation and accurately unstack the data based on the specified column locations.
