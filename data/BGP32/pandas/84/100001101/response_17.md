### Bug analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to unstack a DataFrame based on specific column locations (`clocs`). However, the function fails to handle hierarchical columns correctly and results in unexpected outputs. The bug occurs when dealing with hierarchical columns during unstacking.

### Bug location:
The bug arises in the section of the code where hierarchical columns are processed. Specifically, the issue occurs when creating new columns after unstacking the DataFrame. Incorrect indices and level names are assigned to the new columns, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug explanation:
The bug causes incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame because the function does not correctly handle hierarchical columns. As a result, the new columns created after unstacking do not preserve the hierarchical structure as intended, leading to errors in the final output.

### Fix strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles hierarchical columns during unstacking.
2. Verify that the new columns created after unstacking retain the hierarchical structure of the original columns.
3. Adjust the index names and codes properly for the new columns based on the original hierarchical columns.

### Corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.index  # Corrected line

        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames

        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By adjusting how the function processes hierarchical columns and reconstructs them after unstacking the DataFrame, the corrected version should now produce the expected results for various test cases.
