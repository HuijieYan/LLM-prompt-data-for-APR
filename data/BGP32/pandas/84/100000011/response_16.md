### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is part of the pandas library and is called when unstacking on multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The bug arises when trying to unstack on multiple levels with tuple names causing a KeyError. The bug appears to be specifically related to handling hierarchical columns.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function is not properly handling hierarchical columns (`MultiIndex`) when unstacking multiple levels.
2. The error occurs when trying to get the level number based on the `clocs` parameter, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is due to the function trying to extract the level number based on the label provided in the `clocs` parameter, but it fails to find the proper level number for hierarchical columns with tuple names, hence raising a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The function needs to be updated to properly handle hierarchical columns and extract the level number when dealing with tuple names associated with the MultiIndex levels. This can be achieved by modifying the level extraction process to handle tuple names correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle hierarchical columns when extracting level numbers
    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc = tuple(item if isinstance(item, int) else data.columns.get_loc(item) for item in loc)
        cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
  
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
    ...
``` 

This fixed version modifies the extraction of level numbers by converting tuple labels into level numbers when dealing with hierarchical columns. Such adjustments enable the correct processing of MultiIndex with tuple names during unstacking operations.
