### Analysis:
The issue mentioned on GitHub describes a problem where the `unstack` operation fails when a MultiIndexed Series is provided with tuple names. The error occurs when `unstack` tries to find the level number corresponding to a provided level name, and it fails to find a match, resulting in a KeyError.

### Identified Errors:
1. The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line where it tries to get the level number of the provided column location.
2. The code does not handle hierarchical columns (`MultiIndex`) correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the function not handling tuple names correctly when looking up the level number in the MultiIndex. This discrepancy leads to a KeyError, causing the whole operation to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle hierarchical columns properly and correctly retrieve the level number of the provided column location. This will prevent the KeyError and ensure the `unstack` operation works correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns correctly
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [(name if name in data.columns.names else idx) for idx, name in enumerate(clocs)]
        result = data
        for val in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
        
        return result

    # Proceed with unstacking routine
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...

```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the correct retrieval of the level number (checking for tuples in the column names) and properly addressing the case of hierarchical columns, the unstack operation should work correctly for MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.
