### Analysis:
The function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame or Series along multiple levels. The issue reported on GitHub is related to unstacking a Series with a MultiIndex having tuple names. The error is occurring during the process of identifying the level number in the MultiIndex.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The extraction of level numbers from the `clocs` variable.
2. The handling of `clocs` and `rlocs` to filter out the correct levels.
3. The conversion of DataFrames with MultiIndex columns.
4. Setting the new index or columns after unstacking.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex level names represented as tuples, resulting in a KeyError when trying to find the level number.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the retrieval of level number from the MultiIndex, especially when dealing with tuple names. Additionally, ensuring that the conversion to MultiIndex for unstacking is done accurately based on the provided `fill_value`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(ccodes[0], name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=[ccodes[0]] + [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs],
            codes=[ccodes[0]] + [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs],
            names=["__placeholder__"] + [index.names[i] for i in rlocs],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    # Set new index or columns after unstacking based on the type
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([unstacked.index], names=[cnames] + ["__placeholder__"])
    else:
        unstacked.columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays([unstacked.columns], names=[cnames] + ["__placeholder__"])

    return unstacked
```

By explicitly checking for tuples when getting the level numbers and correctly handling the MultiIndex conversion, this corrected version of the function should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported on GitHub.
