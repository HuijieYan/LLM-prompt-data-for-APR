### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations, specifically for multiple levels of hierarchical indices. The function seems to be encountering issues when dealing with hierarchical columns. The error is triggered by the `index._get_level_number` method, suggesting that there might be a problem with how the hierarchical column names are being accessed or processed within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing level numbers from hierarchical index columns
2. Handling the conversion of column levels to the corresponding level numbers
3. Constructing multi-index components for the unstacked data
4. Updating the index or column names/levels after unstacking

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the function not being able to correctly determine the level numbers of the hierarchical column names (`'A'`, `'a'`, etc.) when processing the unstack operation on a MultiIndex with tuple names. This leads to a KeyError indicating that the specified column level is not found in the index.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the function correctly handles multi-level column names when unstacking. This involves properly mapping the column names to their corresponding level numbers and restructuring the unstacked result with the appropriate multi-index components.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue with unstacking MultiIndexes with tuple names:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(level, list):
        level = [level]

    if len(level) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in level]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By ensuring correct level mappings, handling tuple names appropriately, and adjusting the construction of the multi-index components, this corrected version of the function should be able to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to unstacking MultiIndexes with tuple names.
