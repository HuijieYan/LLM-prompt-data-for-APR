### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used in the context of unstacking a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series. The issue reported on GitHub is related to unstacking with tuple names and leads to a `KeyError` due to an attempt to access the level using a tuple name, which is unsupported. The `KeyError` arises from the `index._get_level_number(i)` method.

### Error Locations:
1. The error occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where `index._get_level_number(i)` is attempting to find the level number based on the tuple name, resulting in a `KeyError`.
2. The issue is linked to the fact that the function is not prepared to handle hierarchical columns, as noted in the comment.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the attempt to find the level number based on the column tuple name. The function `_unstack_multiple` doesn't handle hierarchical columns, leading to the issue of unsupported tuple names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, modify the function to handle hierarchical columns correctly by directly passing the level number (integer) instead of the tuple name as input to `_get_level_number`. This revision will ensure that the function can locate the column level accurately, preventing the `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function addressing the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Find the level number directly instead of using the tuple name
    clocs = [idx if isinstance(idx, int) else index.names.index(idx) for idx in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, the revised line ensures that `clocs` are converted to integers if they are level numbers. Otherwise, it retrieves the level number corresponding to the tuple name. This change corrects the bug and enables the function to handle the hierarchical columns properly.
