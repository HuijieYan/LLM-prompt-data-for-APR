### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to handle unstacking for MultiIndexes, but there is a problem with identifying the level numbers correctly when dealing with hierarchical columns.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line where `index._get_level_number(i)` is trying to get the level number for each level name specified in `clocs`.
2. The `KeyError` occurring within the `_get_level_number` function which is raised when the level name is not found.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is being caused because the function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to get the level number for each specified level name in the hierarchical columns, but due to the hierarchical nature of the columns, the level names are tuples like `('A', 'a')`. This results in the `KeyError` as the function expects level names to be individual strings. This inconsistency leads to the failure of unstacking with tuple names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle hierarchical column names in the MultiIndex correctly. The function should be updated to identify and handle tuples as level names properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        col_index = data.index.remove_unused_levels()
    else:
        col_index = index.remove_unused_levels().droplevel(rlocs).reorder_levels(clocs)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data.unstack(col_index.names, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the unstacking of multiple levels with hierarchical columns, including tuples as level names. It utilizes the proper method to remove unused levels, reorder levels based on the specified `clocs`, and unstack the data appropriately. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
