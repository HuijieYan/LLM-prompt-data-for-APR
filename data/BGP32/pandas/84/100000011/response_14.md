### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is critical in handling the unstacking operation for MultiIndexed DataFrames and Series in pandas. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with unstacking when tuple names are provided as input.

### Error Locations:
1. The error seems to originate from the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
2. Another potential error location could be with:
```python
dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of tuple names within the `_unstack_multiple` function. When tuple names are passed for unstacking, the function fails to interpret them correctly, leading to KeyErrors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify how the tuple names are handled at the start of the function.
2. Ensure that tuple names are accurately processed and retained during the unstacking operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle tuple names correctly
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    if all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        clocs = [col for col in data.columns if col in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the function as shown above, tuple names provided for unstacking should now be appropriately handled, and the KeyError issue should be resolved.
