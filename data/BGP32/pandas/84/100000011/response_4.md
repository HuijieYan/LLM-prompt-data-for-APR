### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling hierarchical columns correctly, leading to the issue raised on GitHub where `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` generates a `KeyError: 'Level A not found'`. The problem arises from the way the function extracts the level numbers based on the input column locations (`clocs`).

### Error Locations:
1. The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is problematic as it directly tries to extract level numbers based on the column locations provided, assuming a flat index structure without handling hierarchical columns.

2. The subsequent code that constructs `clevels`, `ccodes`, `cnames` assumes a flat index structure without considering the hierarchical nature of the columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function doesn't account for the hierarchical columns in the index structure while going through the column locations provided. This leads to errors in constructing the levels and codes for unstacking the data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to handle hierarchical columns correctly by considering each level of the index when dealing with column locations.
2. Adjust the creation of `clevels`, `ccodes`, and `cnames` to capture all levels present in the index structure to prevent `KeyError` issues.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Construction of dummy_index based on index structure
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels, codes=rcodes, names=rnames, verify_integrity=False)

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = rlevels + clevels
    new_names = rnames + cnames
    new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should address the issue raised on GitHub related to MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names failing with KeyError.
