### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling hierarchical (multi-level) columns correctly.
- The error occurs when the `unstack` method is called on a Series with a multi-index where the multi-index is specified by tuple names like `("A", "a")`.
- The error is due to incorrect handling of multi-level columns in the `_unstack_multiple` function.
- The function fails to extract the level numbers correctly, resulting in a KeyError when looking for a specific level.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function trying to find the level by name instead of the tuple (multi-level) name.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles the extraction of level numbers for multi-level columns specified by tuple names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers based on clocs
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```  

This corrected version addresses the issue by correctly determining the level number for multi-level columns specified by tuple names, preventing the KeyError issue during the unstack operation.
