### Analysis:
The GitHub issue reported a problem when unstacking a MultiIndexed Series using the `.unstack()` method. The issue arises when trying to unstack based on a tuple containing column names, which triggers a KeyError while trying to retrieve the level number from the index. This error occurs specifically in the `_get_level_number` function.

### Identified Error:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple()` attempts to identify the level numbers of the specified column locations using `index._get_level_number(i)`, but it doesn't consider the scenario where the column names are tuples. This leads to the `KeyError` when trying to find the level of a column that is represented as a tuple.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the expected input format (individual column names) and the actual input format (tuples representing column names). The code is not equipped to handle tuples as input for column locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the code should be modified to support the unstacking of MultiIndexed Series based on tuples representing column names. This involves updating the logic for identifying the level numbers of the specified column locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get a list of level indices based on clocs
    index = data.index
    
    def _get_level_number(i):
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            return tuple(index.names).index(i)
        return index.names.index(i)

    clocs = [_get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function, a new inner function `_get_level_number()` has been introduced to properly handle the case where the column name is supplied as a tuple. This modification ensures that the correct level number is retrieved for both individual column names and column name tuples.
