### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is called by the `unstack` function in the DataFrame/Series object when trying to unstack a MultiIndex. The issue reported on GitHub is related to unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names, which is currently failing with a `KeyError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `clocs` variable may not be properly manipulated.
2. Handling of the `clocs` and `rlocs` lists may result in an incorrect selection.
3. The process of constructing the `dummy_index` and the `new_columns` MultiIndex may lead to inconsistencies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the function handles the column location identification using the `clocs` variable. It improperly identifies the level number inside the MultiIndex. This causes a KeyError when trying to unstack based on a level that is represented as a tuple.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the identification of the levels from a MultiIndex, especially when dealing with tuple names. One approach is to differentiate the handling of single level and MultiIndex level unstacking scenarios to prevent issues like the one encountered in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rloc_numbers]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rloc_numbers == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(cloc_numbers)):
                val = cloc_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By ensuring proper handling of the level numbers inside the MultiIndex, especially when tuple names are involved, we can fix the issue that was reported on GitHub. This corrected version of the function should now be able to handle unstacking with tuple names without causing a KeyError.
