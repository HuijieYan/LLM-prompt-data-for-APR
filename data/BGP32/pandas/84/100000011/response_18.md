### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for unstacking a DataFrame or Series based on specified column locations `clocs`. The issue on GitHub is related to unstacking a MultiIndexed Series where tuple names are used. The error occurs because the buggy function doesn't handle hierarchical columns properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to unstack based on the specified level names.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function doesn't account for hierarchical columns.
2. The `KeyError` in the `_get_level_number` function indicates a problem with level names and indexing.
3. The function incorrectly populates `clocs` without validating them against the actual levels.
4. The creation of the dummy index and unstacking process may not handle multi-level names correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of multi-level index names. The function doesn't correctly map the specified column level names to their actual levels in the index, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to unstack based on those names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly maps the specified column levels to their actual levels in the index, especially in the case of multi-level names. Additionally, adjustments should be made to handle hierarchical columns and tuple names correctly during the unstacking process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # This case should handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for level_name in clocs:
            level = data.columns.get_level_values(level_name)
            result = result.unstack(level_name, fill_value=fill_value)

        return result

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

### Summary:
The bug was due to the incomplete handling of hierarchical columns and provided level names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The correct version ensures that the specified column levels are properly mapped to their actual levels in the index, allowing for successful unstacking, especially in the case of multi-level names.
