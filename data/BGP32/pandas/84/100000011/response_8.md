### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to handle unstacking of multi-index data. The buggy function has a hint stating that it doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet, which indicates a potential issue with unstacking multi-index with tuple names. The GitHub issue is related to unstacking a multi-index series with tuple names, where it fails with a `KeyError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` where it determines the level numbers could be causing issues with tuples as levels.
2. Handling of multi-index levels during unstacking could be impacting the process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_unstack_multiple` not handling multi-index with tuple names correctly, leading to errors like `KeyError`. It fails to properly extract the level number for tuples when determining the level numbers, leading to the failure of unstacking.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle multi-index columns with tuple names. This involves appropriately getting the level number for tuples and adjusting the processing logic to accommodate tuple-based column names during unstacking.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function makes sure to handle tuple names correctly when determining the level numbers, allowing for successful unstacking of multi-index data with tuple names.
