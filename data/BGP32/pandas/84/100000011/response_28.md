### Analysis:
The bug occurs when unstacking a MultiIndexed Series with tuple names. The error is raised due to the `_get_level_number` function trying to find the integer index of the provided level name. However, in the case of tuple names, the function fails to match the string tuple name to an integer index.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The error arises in the conversion of the provided level name to an index number.
- The slicing and manipulation of the input data might be incorrect for MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_get_level_number` not being able to handle tuple names when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed Series. This leads to a KeyError for the level name provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be able to handle tuple names as level names and convert them properly to the corresponding index numbers. Additionally, the slicing and reconstruction of the data should be corrected to accommodate these tuple names when unstacking the MultiIndexed Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the input data
    index = data.index

    # Change level names to their corresponding integers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Construct the dummy index based on the unstacking operation
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By fixing the level name conversion to integer indices and adjusting the construction of the dummy index, this corrected version of the function should resolve the KeyError issue when unstacking a MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.
