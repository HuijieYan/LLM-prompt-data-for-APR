### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The error is occurring due to the way the function is handling the specified levels when unstacking.

1. The function first determines the level numbers based on the provided clocs, which are the column levels to unstack.
2. It then divides the levels into clocs and rlocs for column levels and the remaining levels, respectively.
3. It performs unstacking based on the provided clocs and reconstructs the MultiIndex if needed.
4. The error stems from how the function handles the level names and level indices during unstacking.

The error is related to the fact that the function wrongly assumes that the levels provided are the level numbers, which is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The issue is caused by the assumption that the provided levels in `clocs` are level numbers directly, while they should be names of the levels. When attempting to convert these names to level numbers via `index._get_level_number(i)`, it results in KeyError or ValueError as the names don't match the existing level names.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to properly interpret the levels provided in `clocs` as level names instead of level numbers directly. This involves using the level names to correctly determine which levels to unstack rather than treating them as integers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_level_values(i).name for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index.names[i] not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By retrieving the level names from the MultiIndex and using those names properly, the corrected function should handle the unstacking operation as expected.

This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
