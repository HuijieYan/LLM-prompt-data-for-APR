### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is experiencing an issue with identifying the level number causing a KeyError.
2. The error is occurring at line 320 where the `clocs` are transformed to level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`.
3. The error message indicates that the name 'A' is not found because it is being passed as a tuple ('A', 'a') instead of a single string.
4. The bug seems to stem from passing a tuple name in the `unstack` function, causing the KeyError during the transformation to level numbers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to handle cases where a tuple name is passed to the `unstack` function.
2. Adjust the indexing procedure to correctly identify the level numbers when dealing with tuple names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

The correction involves checking if the name is a tuple, then extracting the first element of the tuple to handle the tuple names correctly during the level number retrieval process.

This correction should address the KeyError caused by passing tuple names in the `unstack` function.
