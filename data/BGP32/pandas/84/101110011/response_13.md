### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for unstacking the input data based on the specified levels.
2. The error occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` within `_unstack_multiple`.
3. The error happens because the provided levels are Tuples and the `_get_level_number` function expects the level names to be integers.
4. This bug causes the `KeyError` due to the non-integer level names being provided.
5. The failing tests verify the behavior with MultiIndex and tuple names, showcasing the issue.
6. The bug leads to an inconsistency in handling non-integer level names during unstacking.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple level names correctly.
2. Ensure that non-integer level names are recognized and processed appropriately.
3. Update the logic in `_unstack_multiple` to address the issue of non-integer level names in MultiIndex unstacking.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The corrected version improves the `_unstack_multiple` function by handling tuple level names correctly when calling `_get_level_number`. This modification resolves the KeyError caused by non-integer level names.
