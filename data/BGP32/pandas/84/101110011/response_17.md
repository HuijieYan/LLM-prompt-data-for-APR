### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function in `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` is responsible for the unstacking operation, but it has a bug when dealing with MultiIndexed structures.
2. The error message shows that the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex is a list of tuples, not a list of strings. The bug occurs in `_get_level_number` where it raises a key error when trying to handle tuple names.
3. Based on the GitHub issue description and the failing tests, it is evident that the issue stems from the `_unstack_multiple` function using the `_get_level_number` function to handle MultiIndex levels but failing due to invalid handling of tuple names.
4. The bug is causing a ValueError because it's specifically looking for the 'A' or 'B' string as a level name. Since the names attribute of the MultiIndex consists of tuples, it results in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names correctly in MultiIndex. If a tuple label is provided, convert it to a tuple instead of a string, and use that tuple to locate the level.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly process tuple labels when working with MultiIndexes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        return self.names.index(level)
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    ...  # Rest of the function should be left unchanged
```

By making the above modifications, the bug with handling tuple names in MultiIndex during unstacking operations should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
