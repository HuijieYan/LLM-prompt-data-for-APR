### Bug Analysis
- The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to get the level number using `_get_level_number`.
- The issue stems from passing tuple names in the `clocs` list to `_get_level_number`, causing it to fail.
- The error message indicates that the level name passed, such as 'A', is not found in the list of levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_get_level_number` method to correctly handle tuple names passed as levels.
- Check if the level being searched is a tuple name, then process it accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle clocs being tuple names
    # Check and process tuple names from the index
    index = data.index
    levels = index.levels
    names = index.names
    cloc_numbers = []

    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            for i, tup in enumerate(names):
                if len(tup) == len(loc) and all(name == l for name, l in zip(loc, tup)):
                    cloc_numbers.append(i)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...

```

By adjusting the `_get_level_number` logic to handle tuple names and following the corrected function changes mentioned above, the issue should be fixed. The corrected function should pass the failing tests related to unstacking multi-index levels with tuple names.
