### Analysis
- The function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a multi-index DataFrame using various manipulations and transformations on the index.
- The bug seems to be related to how the levels are extracted and manipulated within the function. Specifically, the use of the names of levels is causing a KeyError in the `_get_level_number` function of the MultiIndex.
- The failing test cases involve unstacking a multi-index DataFrame with tuple names, which causes the bug to manifest with the KeyError for the levels.

### Bug Description
- The bug occurs due to the approach used to extract level numbers (`_get_level_number`) based on the names of levels in the index. The function tries to find the level number corresponding to the given level name in the index. When tuple names are used, the extraction process fails, resulting in the KeyError.
- The failing tests provide scenarios that trigger this bug, revealing the issues with unstacking multi-index DataFrames with tuple names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Avoid using the names of levels to extract level numbers, especially when dealing with tuple names in a MultiIndex.
- Since tuple names are used in the failing tests, the function should handle this case and adjust the approach for extracting level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index([index.codes[i] for i in clocs], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [index.codes[i] for i in clocs], xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name='__placeholder__')
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ['__placeholder__'],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.index.levels[0]] + clevels

    new_names = [data.columns.name] + [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    new_codes = [unstacked.index.codes[0]] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

Applying the above fixes, the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work correctly with the provided failing tests.
