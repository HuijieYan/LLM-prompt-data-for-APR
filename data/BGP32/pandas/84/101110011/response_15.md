### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations on the provided data based on specific column locations.
2. The error message indicates a `KeyError` during the process of finding level numbers, showing that the `index._get_level_number` is not functioning correctly.
3. The issue identified in the failing test is caused by multiple nested levels in the MultiIndex.
4. The provided GitHub issue details a similar problem with unstacking MultiIndexes that have tuple names, leading to a `KeyError` during the operation.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of multiple nested levels with tuple names in the index when unstacking. The `_get_level_number` function encounters errors due to the structure of the MultiIndex with complex names.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names.
2. Adjust the logic for determining level numbers to accommodate tuple names and nested MultiIndex levels.
3. Handle the unstacking process for different types of indexes appropriately.
4. Update the function to avoid errors like `KeyError` and ensure the correct unstacked result.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't yet handle hierarchical columns

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names correctly and adjust the level number determination logic, the bug causing the `KeyError` can be resolved.
