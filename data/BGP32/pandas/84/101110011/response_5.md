### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails when attempting to unstack a DataFrame with a `MultiIndex` having tuple names.
- The error occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` within the `_unstack_multiple` function.
- The error originates from the internal method `_get_level_number` within `MultiIndex` classes.
- The failing tests demonstrate issues when unstacking at certain levels with tuple names in the `MultiIndex`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug arises due to the usage of tuple names in the `MultiIndex`, which causes errors when trying to identify the levels using `_get_level_number`.
- The failing test cases highlight key errors like 'ValueError' and 'KeyError' when the indexing for tuple names fails within the MultiIndex structure.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names more effectively in the `MultiIndex` structure.
- Adjust the attribute lookup logic in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` to handle the tuple names properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

```

By making these modifications, the corrected function should be able to handle indexing with tuple names correctly, resolving the `KeyError` and `ValueError` issues highlighted in the failing tests.
