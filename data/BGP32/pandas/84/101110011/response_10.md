### Analysis:
- The current `_unstack_multiple` function is failing to handle MultiIndexed data correctly, resulting in `KeyError` exceptions.
- The key issue lies in how the function processes the names of levels in the MultiIndex.
- The failing test cases have MultiIndexed data with tuple names that are not being handled properly by the `_unstack_multiple` function.
- The error message indicates that the function is unable to find the specified level.
- The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where unstacking with tuple names results in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is how it tries to determine the level number from the names of levels in the MultiIndex. Specifically:
- The function tries to find the index of a level name which is not working correctly for tuple names.
- The function expects just a single integer level number and struggles with tuple names.
- When encountering tuple names, it raises a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we should revise how level names are handled in MultiIndexed data. Specifically:
- Check if the provided level descriptor is a tuple, which indicates multi-level indexing.
- Modify the logic to extract level numbers and operate accordingly for each level in the MultiIndex.
- Ensure that the function can accurately identify and process names of levels in both single and multi-level indexing cases.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [(index.names.index(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else index.names.index((name,)) for name in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    
    # The modifications allow for correct processing of tuple names in MultiIndex
    return unstacked
```

By adjusting how levels are determined and handled in the MultiIndex, the corrected function should now properly handle tuple names and other MultiIndex configurations as demonstrated in the failing tests.
