## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to how the `clocs` parameter is being handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is attempting to extract the level numbers of the columns specified in `clocs` from the index, but there seems to be an issue with handling mixed types of column names and level numbers in MultiIndex. The error occurs when trying to access the level number of a column with a name that is not an integer.

To fix this bug, it is essential to modify how the level numbers are obtained based on the column names provided in the `clocs` parameter. The function needs to intelligently identify whether the columns specified in `clocs` are column names or level numbers and handle them accordingly.

To address this issue, the function should be updated to check if the elements in `clocs` are strings (column names) or integers (level numbers). If the elements are strings, the function should look up the level number corresponding to the column name in the MultiIndex. If the elements are integers, they should already represent the level numbers. 

In case of strings (column names), we can create a helper function that will map column names to level numbers. This map can then be used to obtain the level numbers from the column names specified in `clocs`.

After correcting the level number extraction logic, the function should proceed with the remaining operations to unstack the DataFrame correctly for both single and multi-level columns.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_level_number(index, level):
    if isinstance(level, str):
        for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
            if isinstance(name, tuple):
                if name == level:
                    return i
            else:
                if (name,) == level:
                    return i
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    else:
        return level

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should address the issue of extracting level numbers correctly based on the input provided in `clocs`. Now, when the function is called with mixed types of column names and level numbers, it should be able to handle them appropriately and unstack the DataFrame without errors.
