## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of multiple levels in the input data. When attempting to unstack the data with multiple levels, the function fails to correctly identify the levels to unstack, resulting in errors related to level identification.

The specific issues in the code are:
1. The function doesn't properly handle multi-level columns when unstacking.
2. The indexing logic for identifying and processing levels is erroneous.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly process multiple levels in the input data. Specifically, we need to revise how the levels are selected and processed during unstacking to match the expectations of multi-level indexing.

## The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the identified issues and should pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        df = data.to_frame()
    else:
        df = data.copy()

    clocs = clocs[0]

    # Unstack based on the specified levels
    unstacked = df.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Rearrange column MultiIndex
    idx = unstacked.columns if isinstance(unstacked, DataFrame) else unstacked.index
    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
        [(c, idx.get_level_values(c)) for c in idx.names],
        names=idx.names,
    )
    
    # Update index/columns with new MultiIndex
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now correctly unstack the input data with multiple levels and generate the expected output, resolving the issues identified with the initial buggy implementation.
