## Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to handle the case where the clocs parameter is a tuple of length 2. The function is designed to work with a list of column locations, but the given test case involves passing a tuple `(A, a)` and `B` resulting in an error.

The error originates from the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The function expects `clocs` to be a list, but in the failing test case, it is a tuple.

The expected behavior should be to convert the tuple input to a list before processing the column locations.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle both lists and tuples for the `clocs` parameter. Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This modification allows the function to convert the tuple to a list if it receives a tuple as an input for `clocs`, ensuring compatibility with the failing test case.
