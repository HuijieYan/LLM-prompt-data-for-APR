## Fixing the Buggy Function

After analysis of the buggy function, we identified the root cause of the error based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue. The error occurs due to how the function `_get_level_number` handles multi-level indexes with tuple names.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` should be modified to correctly extract the level numbers for the given clocs in the multi-level index. The fix should involve handling the case where the level is a tuple consisting of names.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc(col) for col in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to handle multi-level indexes when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of names. We use `index.get_loc(col)` to get the location of the column with the tuple name and ensure the correct level number is extracted.

This modification should resolve the KeyError issue and ensure that the function behaves correctly for multi-level indexes with tuple names.

After applying this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases specified and resolve the GitHub issue regarding unstacking multi-indexes with tuple names.
