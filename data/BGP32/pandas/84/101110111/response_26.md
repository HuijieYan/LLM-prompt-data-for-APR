Based on the provided information, here are the main observations and the strategy for fixing the bug:

### Observations:
1. The bug occurs when the function `_get_level_number` cannot find the specified level in the MultiIndex causing a ValueError, which leads to a KeyError being raised.
2. The issue stems from the way `clocs` are handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.
3. The incorrect handling of `clocs` leads to problems in constructing the dummy DataFrame and later unstacking it correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the way `clocs` are processed to ensure that the level numbers are correctly obtained for the clocs in the MultiIndex.
2. Adjust the construction of the dummy DataFrame and the subsequent unstacking process to be based on the corrected clocs.

### Updated and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        try:
            cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
            cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f'Level {cloc} not found')

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Construct the dummy Index
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By calculating the `cloc_numbers` correctly based on the valid levels in the MultiIndex, the corrected function should now be able to handle the unstacking operation correctly for different types of inputs. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue and unstacking problems observed in the failing test cases.
