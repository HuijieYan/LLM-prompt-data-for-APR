## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels with tuple names. The operation of getting the level number is causing a KeyError due to this inconsistency.

To resolve this issue, the function should differentiate the handling of MultiIndex levels with tuples as names from regular MultiIndex levels. By identifying the tuple names separately and processing them accordingly, the bug can be fixed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By handling the case of tuple names separately in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases can be resolved.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
