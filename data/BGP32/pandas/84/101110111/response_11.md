## Bug and Cause:

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails when trying to unstack multiple levels of a MultiIndex while passing tuple names as input. The root cause of the bug lies in the `_get_level_number` function, which is called to convert the tuple names into corresponding level numbers. This function expects a single level name as input, but it receives a tuple of names, causing an error and leading to a KeyError during the unstacking process. The provided code does not correctly handle the conversion of tuple names into level numbers, resulting in the KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where tuple names are passed for unstacking a MultiIndex. The code needs to be updated to align with the expected behavior when working with different levels of a MultiIndex with tuple names.

## A Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names to list of level names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    cloc_levels = [name for cloc in clocs for name in cloc]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc_levels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original implementation
    ...
```

By distinguishing the case where tuple names are passed for unstacking a MultiIndex, the corrected function should be able to handle the situation and successfully unstack the MultiIndex according to the provided tuple names.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
