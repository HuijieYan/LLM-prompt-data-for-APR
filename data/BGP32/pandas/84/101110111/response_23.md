## Bug Analysis

1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because the level names `('A', 'a')` are tuples, causing the `_get_level_number` method to fail in handling this input.
2. The issue is related to handling multi-index data where the column levels are tuples.
3. The bug causes a `KeyError` to occur due to the failure in finding the specified level in the multi-index object.
4. To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to properly handle tuple names in the column levels of a multi-index structure.

## Bug Fixing Strategy

1. Update the function `_unstack_multiple` to correctly handle tuple names in the column levels of a multi-index.
2. Check for tuple names in the column levels and extract the appropriate level name for processing.
3. Modify the logic to correctly determine the level number for handling multi-index unstacking.
4. Ensure that the corrections do not affect the functionality for cases where the column levels are not tuples.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_name(level):
        return level if not isinstance(level, tuple) else level[0]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(get_level_name(i)) for i in clocs]

    ...

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we handle tuple names by extracting the first item of the tuple as the level name. This modification ensures that the function can properly handle tuple names in the column levels of a multi-index structure.
