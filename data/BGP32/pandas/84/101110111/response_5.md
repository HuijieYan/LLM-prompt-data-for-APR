## Error Cause and Fix Strategy

### Error Cause:
The error stems from the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class, particularly the line that tries to find the index of the provided level - `level = self.names.index(level)`. This method assumes that the level value is present in the list of names of the `MultiIndex`, which is not always the case when dealing with nested tuples as names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When a tuple is provided as the name, it must handle the case of nested tuples correctly. Instead of directly using `index._get_level_number(i)` for nested tuples, we should check if the name is a tuple and extract individual levels from it. If it is a tuple, we need to iterate over the levels to handle all the levels provided within the tuple.

The corrected version needs to process tuples as names properly and handle the extraction of levels accordingly to avoid the KeyError.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    
    index = data.index

    unstacked = data.copy()

    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            for level in cloc:
                cloc_index = index._get_level_number(level)
                unstacked = unstacked.unstack(cloc_index, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            cloc_index = index._get_level_number(cloc)
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(cloc_index, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version will handle both single levels and tuples of levels correctly when unstacking the DataFrame.

Now, we can test this corrected function against the failing test cases to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
