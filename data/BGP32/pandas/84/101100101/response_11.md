### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns (`data.columns`) and the creation of new columns and levels for unstacking.

1. When `data` is a DataFrame and `data.columns` is a MultiIndex, the current logic in the buggy function does not handle this case correctly. This leads to issues with setting up the new columns and levels for the unstacked DataFrame.

2. In the case where `data.columns` is a MultiIndex, the function should iterate over the `clocs` (levels to unstack) properly and unstack each level sequentially.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to correctly handle the situation where `data.columns` is a MultiIndex. This involves iterating over the `clocs` and unstacking each level one by one.

Here are the steps to fix the bug and provide a corrected version of the function:

1. Add a check to identify if `data.columns` is a MultiIndex and handle this scenario separately.
2. Iterate over the levels in `clocs` and unstack each level sequentially.
3. Update the creation of new columns and levels based on the unstacked result.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This function doesn't handle hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Check if data.columns is MultiIndex for special handling
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data.copy()
        for loc in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same after this point
    # Implement the same logic as before for non-MultiIndex columns
```

By implementing the correct handling for MultiIndex columns, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
