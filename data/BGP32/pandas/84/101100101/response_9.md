### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame based on certain columns specified by the `clocs` parameter. However, the bug causes issues when dealing with hierarchical columns.

The bug originates from incorrectly handling the rlocs (row locations) and modifying the clocs (column locations) in the loop that unstacks the DataFrame. This leads to incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame and results in a failure of the provided test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the loop modifying `clocs` in place causes issues by reducing the values of subsequent column locations in the same iteration. This modification leads to the wrong columns being unstacked, which results in incorrect reshaping.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to avoid modifying `clocs` in place during the iteration. Instead, we should create a copy of `clocs` to ensure that the original values remain unchanged. This way, the correct columns will be properly unstacked, and the DataFrame will be reshaped accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Bug Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            clocs_copy = clocs.copy()
            for i in clocs_copy:
                val = i
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By creating a copy of `clocs` before starting the loop that iterates over it, we prevent undesired modifications to the list, ensuring that the correct columns are unstacked during the DataFrame reshaping. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
