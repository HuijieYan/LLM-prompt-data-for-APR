### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of multiple levels in the column MultiIndex. The function fails to stack the data properly when dealing with tuples in the MultiIndex columns.

1. The function incorrectly handles the scenario where multiple levels are provided for unstacking.
2. The function fails to appropriately manage the column levels and index during the unstacking process.
3. The bug appears when trying to deal with a more complex multi-level column structure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to update the logic associated with handling multi-level column indices. Specifically, we need to ensure that the unstacking process correctly considers and processes the multi-level column index along with the values provided for unstacking.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the levels and codes corresponding to the clocs
    clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.columns.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevel = data.columns.levels[clocs[0]]
    cnames = data.columns.names[clocs[0]]
    rlevel = data.columns.levels[rlocs[0]]
    rnames = data.columns.names[rlocs[0]]

    stacked = data.stack(clocs)
    unstacked = stacked.unstack(clevel, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    # Reconstruct the new columns with proper levels and codes
    new_levels = [rlevel] + [clevel]
    new_names = [rnames] + [cnames]

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.to_frame()

    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        unstacked.columns.codes, names=new_names, levels=new_levels
    )

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The updated function fixes the logic related to unstacking with multiple levels and properly reconstructs the new columns with the correct levels and codes.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
