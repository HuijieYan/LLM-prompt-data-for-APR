### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a MultiIndex data structure based on specified columns (`clocs`) and fill value.
2. The error message indicates that the function is failing at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.
3. The error is triggered because the function `_get_level_number` in the `MultiIndex` class is raising an exception when it doesn't find the specified level (`'A'` in this case), causing it to raise a `KeyError`.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to correctly retrieve the level number based on the level name.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to handle the scenario where a level name is not found properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class to handle the case where the specified level name is not found.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to catch the `KeyError` and handle it gracefully by providing a suitable message.
3. Adjust the flow of the function to handle levels appropriately.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if index.names.count(i) > 0]
  
    if not clocs:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {tuple(clocs)} not found")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By making the above changes, the function will handle the case where a level name is not found appropriately, avoiding the `KeyError` that was occurring previously. Make sure to validate this new implementation with the tests to ensure correctness.
