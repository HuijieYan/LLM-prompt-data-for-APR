### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`.
- The function tries to extract the level number from the MultiIndex object `index` using the method `_get_level_number`.
- The error message indicates that the level name 'A' is not found in the list of names, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The function is trying to find the index of a level name that does not exist in the list of names.
- The related GitHub issue shows that the failure is due to unstacking with tuple names resulting in a `KeyError`.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly attempts to use level names directly instead of corresponding level numbers when trying to unstack the MultiIndexed data.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Extract the level numbers in `clocs` before using them.
2. Use the extracted level numbers to unstack the MultiIndexed data.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not clocs:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

```

By extracting the level numbers before using them, the corrected function should resolve the `KeyError` issue and allow unstacking of MultiIndexed data with tuple names.
