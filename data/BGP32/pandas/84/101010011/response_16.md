### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is a function that is responsible for unstacking a DataFrame or Series with multi-level hierarchy columns. The function is called when trying to perform a unstack operation on a DataFrame or Series with MultiIndex columns. The primary purpose is to adjust the index and columns when unstacking.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. The line where the error occurs:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Explanation of the Bug

The bug is caused because the `Index` or `MultiIndex` object's names defined for the column index might actually be tuple-like structures, leading to an issue when trying to find a level number based on the tuple name. This issue results in an error stating that the 'Level A not found' or 'KeyError' because the names provided are not integers or the exact level numbers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, the code should differentiate between tuple-like structure and direct level numbers/labels when handling the indexing operations based on column names. The function should check if the input is a tuple-like structure or an integer, and based on that, it should correctly extract the level number or perform the unstack operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

This code snippet adjusts the way `clocs` are retrieved by checking if the column name is a tuple (like `('A', 'a')`) and then using `get_loc` method to find the location, or if it's a direct level number that can be obtained using `_get_level_number`. This modification allows the function to work properly with both tuple names and level numbers.
