## Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle the unstacking operation on multi-index data structures in pandas. It handles re-shaping the data based on provided column locations (`clocs`). The error arises when trying to identify the level number of columns based on their names within the index.

The error message indicates that the function is encountering difficulties finding the level 'A' within the list of names during the unstacking operation. This issue is correlated with the GitHub issue where unstacking with tuple names results in KeyError due to the failure of extracting the level number from the index.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The problematic extraction of the level numbers from the index when identifying the column locations (`clocs`).
2. Handling the MultiIndex structure during the unstacking operation.
3. Insufficient handling of edge cases or multi-level indices.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the ambiguous handling of MultiIndex column names when attempting to resolve the level number in the faulty extraction logic. The `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line to derive level numbers inherently causes issues when the required column level is not accurately matched.

The respective error messages about the absence of 'A' in level names validate that 'A' is being treated as a tuple, adversely impacting the extraction and identification process. This misinterpretation leads to the error where the level 'A' or `('A', 'a')` is not found due to incorrectly handling nested column structures in the MultiIndex.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The approach to rectify this bug involves reconsidering the strategy employed to retrieve and process the level number of the columns correctly. Given the issue's context, the fix revolves around refining the method that attempts to map the provided column locations to their corresponding level numbers. By enhancing the way MultiIndex columns are dealt with, addressing tuple names accurately, and improving the extraction process, the bug can be fixed effectively.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(cloc) if isinstance(cloc, (str, tuple)) else cloc for cloc in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(cloc_numbers)):
                val = cloc_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to accurately handle the column names extraction as levels and ensuring the proper processing of the MultiIndex object, the bug should be resolved, and the related GitHub issue should be addressed successfully.
