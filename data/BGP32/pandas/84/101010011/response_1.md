### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used for unstacking a DataFrame along multiple levels. It tries to extract the level numbers corresponding to the given column locations (`clocs`) from the index of the DataFrame.
   
2. The error arises due to `index._get_level_number(i)` where `i` is being taken as a tuple (e.g., ('A', 'a')) instead of its corresponding level number.
   
3. The error message clearly indicates that the issue occurs during the retrieval of the level number.
   
4. The GitHub issue confirms the failure and provides clear steps to reproduce it, which is essential for verifying the fix.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that `clocs` contain only level numbers (integers) rather than tuples like ('A', 'a'). This can be done by updating the input handling or extracting the level numbers before using `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extracting level numbers directly if tuple names are given
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    ...
```

In the corrected code:
- I added a check to see if the provided `clocs` contain tuples, indicative of named levels.
- If tuples are detected, I extracted their respective integer positions in the index using `index.get_loc(c)`.
- This modification ensures that the inner code works with level numbers as expected.

This fix should address the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases linked to the GitHub issue.
