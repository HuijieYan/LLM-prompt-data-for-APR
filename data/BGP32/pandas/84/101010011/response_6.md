### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` takes data, column locations (`clocs`), and fill value as input.
2. The error occurs when the `clocs` are being processed for identifying which level each loc belongs to in the index.
3. The error message suggests that `ValueError` is raised because 'A' is not found in the list of names.
4. The GitHub issue provides a similar scenario where unstacking with tuple names fails with a `KeyError`. This scenario matches the error message from the failing tests.
5. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of levels that are provided as tuples.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code within `_unstack_multiple` to correctly handle levels provided as tuples in the `clocs` list.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the level numbers for hierarchical levels specified as tuples.

### Bug-Fix in the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify processing for levels given as tuples
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By checking if an item in the `clocs` list is a tuple, we correctly handle tuples representing hierarchical levels. This modification should resolve the issue and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test cases.
