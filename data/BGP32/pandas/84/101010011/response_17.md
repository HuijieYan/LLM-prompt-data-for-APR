### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of `MultiIndex` when trying to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex while unstacking. The bug is caused by the mismatch between the expected input (a tuple of names) and the way the code internally deals with these names. This results in exceptions like `KeyError` and `ValueError` due to the use of `index` method on the list of names which fails to find tuple names like 'A'. This happens when `unstack` method is called with tuple names instead of single level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the input tuple names when unstacking with MultiIndexes. The fix involves updating the part of the code that deals with extracting the level numbers from the names of the MultiIndex. By checking if the name is a tuple, we can differentiate between single names and tuple names, retrieving the level numbers correctly in both cases.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Update this line

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

### Changes Made
By adding a conditional statement to check if the item in `clocs` list is a tuple before extracting the level number, we ensure that tuple names are handled correctly.

### Bug Fixes
After applying this corrective fix, the function should now correctly handle MultiIndex unstacking with tuple names as specified in the failing tests and avoid the `KeyError` or `ValueError` exceptions.
