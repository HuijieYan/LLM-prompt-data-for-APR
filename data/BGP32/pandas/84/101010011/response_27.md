### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is part of the Pandas library's reshaping functionality.
- The function is responsible for handling unstacking of data with multiple levels, especially when dealing with hierarchical columns.
- The bug seems to be related to handling MultiIndexed data, particularly when trying to find the level numbers based on the input names.
- The error message indicates that the level name is not found in the list of names, leading to a KeyError.
- The GitHub issue provided aligns with this bug, where you're trying to unstack MultiIndexed data with tuple names, resulting in the same error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to retrieve the level numbers based on the names provided. This function is not handling the names correctly for MultiIndexed data.
- The `_get_level_number` method is used to find level numbers for the names provided, but it fails in cases where the names are tuples or not directly present in the list of names.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- Update the `_get_level_number` method to properly handle tuples or other variations of level identifiers, ensuring that the correct level number is retrieved for unstacking MultiIndexed data.
- Modify the handling of level names in the `_unstack_multiple` function to align with the changes made in `_get_level_number`.
- Ensure that the function correctly identifies the levels for unstacking even when dealing with nested or tuple names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

### Reasoning:
- In the corrected version, the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]` ensures that the level number is correctly retrieved for both single level names and tuples.
- By differentiating the handling based on the type of input name, we address the issue of finding the level number when dealing with mixed types of level identifiers.
- The function should now be able to properly retrieve the level numbers and perform unstacking on MultiIndexed data, resolving the KeyError issue seen in the failing tests.
