### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` has an issue in the line where it tries to get the level number of a MultiIndex. The error is due to providing the level name within a tuple when it expects a simple name. This causes the function to fail with a `KeyError` or a `ValueError`.

### Bug Location
The bug lies in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
where `i` is expected to be a level name but is provided as a tuple in the failing test. This is the root cause of the issue.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because in the failing test, a tuple is passed as the level parameter, whereas the function `_get_level_number` in `MultiIndex` expects a single level name. This mismatch causes an exception in the function `_get_level_number`, leading to a KeyError or a ValueError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level passed to `_get_level_number` is a single level name, not a tuple. If it's a tuple, we should handle it correctly to avoid the error.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_names = [i if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i[0] for i in clocs]  # Extract single level names
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    .
    .  # Rest of the original function remains the same
    .

    return unstacked
```

This correction ensures that only single level names are passed to `_get_level_number` regardless of whether the original level was a tuple. It makes the function more robust and able to handle tuple level names.
