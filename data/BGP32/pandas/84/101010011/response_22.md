### Analysis:
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function is responsible for processing `MultiIndex` columns during unstacking in pandas.
2. The error occurs when trying to retrieve the level number for a given level name from the `MultiIndex`.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to find the level by name within the `MultiIndex`.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem and the use of tuple names leads to the error.
5. The function fails when presented with tuple names for indexing.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `_get_level_number` function in the `MultiIndex` class expects a single name as input, not a tuple.
2. The usage of tuple names causes the lookup issue since the workaround to unstack tuple names isn't handled properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the parsing of level names in `_unstack_multiple` to handle tuples correctly.
2. Split tuple-based level names into individual components for proper processing.
3. Implement a solution to handle the specified tuple-based format in indexing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code stays the same
```

### Correction Rationale:
1. Modify the list comprehension to handle tuple-based level names correctly.
2. If the level name is a tuple, extract the first component of the tuple for processing.
3. This change ensures proper level name extraction for both regular names and tuple names.

By making these adjustments, the function should now be able to handle tuple-based names correctly during processing and avoid the `KeyError` issue.
