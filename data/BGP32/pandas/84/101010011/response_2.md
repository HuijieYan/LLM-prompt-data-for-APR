### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking DataFrame objects with multiple levels in the index, specifically for hierarchical columns.
2. The error occurs when trying to extract level numbers from the index for each provided name in `clocs` to identify which levels to keep fixed during unstacking.
3. The bug arises from attempting to process tuples as names while extracting level numbers from the index, leading to a `KeyError` or `ValueError`, as seen in the failing tests.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that unstacking with tuple names was not properly handled, leading to errors when identifying levels within the index.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` incorrectly assumes that all names in `clocs` are single level names to be converted to level numbers directly.
2. When tuple names are provided, the function fails to identify the correct level numbers due to the incorrect processing of tuples as single names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to handle both single names and tuple names properly.
2. Implement a check to differentiate between single names and tuple names before extracting level numbers.
3. Extract level numbers correctly based on the type of name provided in `clocs` to prevent errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [idx if isinstance(idx, tuple) else (idx,) for idx in clocs]  # Convert single names to tuples

    cloc_levels = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs for name in idx]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

Now, the corrected function can accurately process both single names and tuple names in `clocs` for identifying level numbers during unstacking.
