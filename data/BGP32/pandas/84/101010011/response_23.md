### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `clocs` list is processed to get the level number within the index. The issue is due to the use of `index._get_level_number(i)` where `i` is a tuple `('A', 'a')` instead of an integer in the context of a MultiIndex. This leads to the function trying to locate `('A', 'a')` as a level name in the MultiIndex, which fails and raises a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function is expecting `clocs` to contain level numbers, but they are tuple names.
2. The `_get_level_number` function is used incorrectly with tuple names instead of integers.
3. The bug results from inconsistencies in handling `clocs` which should be level numbers, leading to KeyError and ValueError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to extract the level index correctly from the MultiIndex based on the tuple's first element.
2. If `clocs` is made up of tuple names, it should be converted to level numbers before further processing.
3. Update the extraction approach to align with the actual requirements for processing levels in a MultiIndex.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With this change, the function will correctly handle tuple names by extracting the level number from the first element in each tuple, resolving the KeyError and ValueError issues.
