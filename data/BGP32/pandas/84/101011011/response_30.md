### Issue Analysis:

The error occurs due to the `_get_level_number` method encountering an issue where it expects the provided level to be a level number but receives a tuple instead. This leads to the KeyError, causing the test to fail.

1. The function tries to extract the level numbers corresponding to the levels provided in `clocs`, which in this case is `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`. 
2. The naming convention of levels as tuples instead of integers causes issues when trying to extract the level number.
3. The attempt to access `index._get_level_number('A')` results in the ValueError and subsequent KeyError due to non-integer level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Modify the function to handle level names provided as tuples by checking if the input is a string. If it is, use the provided level number; if not, extract the level number for that level name.
2. Ensure that the level names are correctly handled to avoid the KeyError and successfully unstack the MultiIndex.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_level_number(level):
    if isinstance(level, str):
        return level
    try:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        return self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code unchanged

```

By modifying the `_get_level_number` function to handle both level names and level numbers correctly, the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle tuple names in MultiIndex unstacking without raising errors.
