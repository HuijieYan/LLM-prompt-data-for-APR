### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class when trying to find the level number corresponding to a given level name.
- The error message indicates that `'A' is not in list`, causing a `ValueError` to be raised initially. Then, a `KeyError` is raised with the message `'Level A not found`.
- The inputs to the function include a tuple `clocs` representing column locations and a DataFrame `data` containing the data to unstack.
- The primary issue arises from how the levels and level names are handled within the MultiIndex, leading to incorrect level number retrieval.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function wrongly assumes that the level names are always represented by integers, leading to an incorrect attempt to index them.
2. Due to the names being tuples like `('A', 'a')`, the code attempts to find integer indices for these tuples in the list of names, causing the failure.
3. This behavior triggers the ValueError initially and then the KeyError since it incorrectly treats the names as integers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple level names correctly by searching for the tuple in the list of names.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to account for handling tuple names when extracting level numbers.
3. Adjust the relevant sections to correctly handle tuple names and fetch their corresponding level numbers.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = sum(1 for name in self.names if name == level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

Applying this fix should address the issues described and allow the tests to pass successfully.
