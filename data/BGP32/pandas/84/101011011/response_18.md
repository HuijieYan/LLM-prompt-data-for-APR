### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the fact that it assumes `clocs` contains level names, but the `_get_level_number` function expects level numbers. The error occurs during the conversion of level names to numbers. This inconsistency causes a `"KeyError: 'Level A not found'"` or a `"ValueError: 'A' is not in list"` due to incorrect handling of the level specified when calling `unstack`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` list contains level numbers instead of names. The correct level numbers can be obtained by modifying the logic around extracting level numbers from the index. By ensuring that `clocs` contains level numbers as expected by the `_get_level_number` function, we can resolve the issue and prevent the KeyError or ValueError during the unstack operation.

### Corrected Version

This corrected version modifies the code to extract level numbers properly, ensuring that `clocs` contains the expected level numbers before calling `_get_level_number`:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    nlevels = index.nlevels

    clocs = [level if isinstance(level, int) else index.get_loc_level(level)[0] for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By updating the extraction of level numbers in `clocs`, this corrected version should resolve the issue and ensure the unstack operation proceeds correctly without the KeyError or ValueError.
