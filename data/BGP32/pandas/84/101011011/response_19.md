### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_get_level_number` is responsible for converting level names to numbers. The error occurs when a tuple (e.g., `('A', 'a')`) is passed as `level`. This leads to the ValueError 'A' is not in list.
2. The issue stems from passing the entire tuple `('A', 'a')` as `level`.
3. The function expects `level` to be a single string related to the column level name, not a tuple.
4. The implementation error in `_unstack_multiple` results from the processing of the `clocs` input parameter where a tuple (`('A', 'a')`) is wrongly used. The `index._get_level_number(i)` step fails since `i` is `('A', 'a')`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to expect a single level name instead of a tuple.
2. Extract the correct level name from the tuple before passing it to `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process each level individually
    index = data.index
    levels_names = [level if isinstance(level, str) else level[0] for level in clocs]  # Extract level names

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in levels_names]  # Use individual level names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining unchanged ...
```

Applying this fix should resolve the issue with passing a tuple as the level name and the subsequent KeyError or ValueError in the `_unstack_multiple` function when processing MultiIndex data.
