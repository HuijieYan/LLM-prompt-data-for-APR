### Bug Explanation

The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function not being able to handle tuple names properly in MultiIndex. The key point of failure happens in the `_get_level_number` function when it tries to index `level` within `self.names`, which causes a `ValueError` or `KeyError` if the indexing fails due to mismatched data types.

### Bug Location

The issue occurs when the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to extract the level number from the provided columns, specifically when the column names are provided as a tuple. The extraction logic fails due to the incorrect handling of tuple names in MultiIndex objects.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_level_number` method so that it correctly handles tuple names within MultiIndex objects. This will involve modifying the logic to handle tuples as input for the level.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

### Summary

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tuple names in the MultiIndex `_get_level_number` method. By modifying the logic to account for tuple names, we can fix the bug and resolve the unstacking issue when tuple names are provided as columns in the MultiIndex.
