### Analysis
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to the handling of multi-level names in the MultiIndex. The function tries to retrieve the level numbers of the columns provided by the `clocs` argument to proceed with unstacking. However, it fails due to incorrect handling of the tuples passed as level names in the MultiIndex. This issue originates from the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class.

The function tries to convert tuple names like `('A', 'a')` into level numbers, which doesn't work correctly because `tuple` objects are not directly present in the list of level names. This leads to the ValueError and KeyError exceptions indicating the failure to find the specified level in the index.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function fails to appropriately handle tuple names such as `('A', 'a')` in the MultiIndex object when converting them to level numbers.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should check if the provided level is a tuple, split it into individual strings (the components of the tuple), and then match these strings with the level names in the MultiIndex to get the corresponding level numbers. This will resolve the issue with handling tuple names.

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names to individual component strings
    clocs = [
        [name for t in col for name in t] if isinstance(col, tuple) else col
        for col in clocs
    ]

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

This corrected version should handle tuple names correctly and resolve the ValueError and KeyError exceptions when trying to convert tuple names into level numbers.
