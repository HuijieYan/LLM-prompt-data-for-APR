### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to extract the level numbers from the input column locations (`clocs`). The issue arises from the fact that the `clocs` parameter is passed as a tuple containing tuple names, leading to an error when trying to interpret them as level names and resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To resolve the bug, we need to modify the way we handle the `clocs` input. Since `clocs` contains tuple names instead of level names directly, we should extract the level names from the tuple names before attempting to get their level numbers.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cnames = [index.get_level_values(ln) for ln in clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in cnames]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we extract the level names from the tuple names in the `clocs` parameter before determining their level numbers. This modification ensures that we are correctly identifying the levels to work with in the subsequent part of the function.
