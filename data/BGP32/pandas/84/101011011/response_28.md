### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error arises from the attempt to find the level number for a tuple name instead of an integer. This issue is leading to a KeyError due to the wrong handling of Tuple names within the multi-index columns.

### Bug Cause
The specific part within the buggy function causing this issue is when the tuple names are provided as column locations (clocs) in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The code treats these tuple names as indices to retrieve the level numbers, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the code should correctly handle the tuple names if provided as column locations. The function should recognize tuple names and correctly associate them with the levels in the MultiIndex.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i)
        for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code as it is...
```

In the corrected code, we check if the column location is a tuple or single level and adjust the extraction of level numbers accordingly. This modification ensures that tuple names are handled correctly within the MultiIndex, preventing the KeyError issue.
