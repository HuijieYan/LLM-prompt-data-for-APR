### Bug Analysis:

The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method within the MultiIndex class. The issue arises from attempting to find the index of a level that is a tuple name instead of a single label. This results in a KeyError being raised when attempting to locate the level.

In the `_unstack_multiple` function, there is a problem when trying to get the level number for the provided labels in `clocs`. The `_get_level_number` method does not handle multiple labels correctly, leading to the KeyError and resulting in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the level is handled within the `clocs` list. Instead of directly passing the labels to the `_get_level_number` method, we can first check if the label is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we need to extract the individual components of the tuple and retrieve the corresponding level number for each label.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_nums = []
    for i in clocs:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            cloc_nums.extend([index._get_level_number(j) for j in i])
        else:
            cloc_nums.append(index._get_level_number(i))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_nums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code same as original function
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle multiple labels passed as tuples and extract the proper level numbers for each label. This modification should resolve the KeyError issue and make the tests pass successfully.
