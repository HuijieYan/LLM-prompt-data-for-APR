### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `_get_level_number` function is called to find the level number for a given level name in a MultiIndex. The issue arises from passing a tuple of names instead of a single name as the level parameter. This causes an error because the function expects a single name or number to identify the level of the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle tuple names correctly when calling the `_get_level_number` function. The fix involves modifying the way the `clocs` list is constructed and handling tuple names appropriately.

### Bug Fix for the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle tuple names in the MultiIndex
    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # The remaining code remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```

By correcting the way tuple names are handled in the `clocs` list, the function will be able to process the input correctly and avoid the KeyErrors encountered in the failing tests.
