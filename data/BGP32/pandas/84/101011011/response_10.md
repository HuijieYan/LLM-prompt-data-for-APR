### Bug Explanation

The root cause of the error lies in the `_get_level_number` method, where the `level` needs to be passed as an integer instead of a tuple if it occurs more than once in the `names`. This is not handled properly in the current implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The error occurs because `clocs` is a tuple of tuples `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which gets represented as a list of tuples by `[index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The tuple `('A', 'a')` is not directly present as a level number, leading to an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` variable is processed correctly, especially when it contains tuples as elements. We should extract those tuples and convert them to the appropriate integer level indices.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from tuples if present
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By converting the tuple elements in `clocs` to their corresponding level numbers when needed, we ensure that the function can handle multiple levels correctly and avoid the errors that arise from passing tuples to the `_get_level_number` method.
