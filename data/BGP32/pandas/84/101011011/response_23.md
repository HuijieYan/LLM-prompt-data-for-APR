### Bug Analysis:
The bug is caused by passing a tuple of names as the level parameter to the `unstack()` function. This leads to an error in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. The error occurs because the function expects a single level string but encounters a tuple which is not found in the names list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the input handling code for `clocs` so that if the input is a tuple, extract the individual levels from the tuple.
2. Ensure that the `clocs` list contains valid level numbers for the given MultiIndex.
3. Update the way levels are accessed and handled in the function to accommodate tuple names for multi-level indexes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if input is a tuple
        clocs = [index.names.index(level) for level in clocs]  # Get level numbers for the tuple of names
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(clocs)]  # Get level number directly
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # The rest of the function remains the same as the original
    ...
    
    return unstacked
```

Applying the above changes to handle tuple inputs correctly and modifying level number retrieval should address the issue described in the failing test cases.
