### Bug Explanation

The core issue in the `index._get_level_number(i)` call arises from passing a tuple of names like `('A', 'a')` to the function instead of an integer level number. The buggy function expects level numbers but receives names instead, leading to the error in which it tries to find these names as integers and fails, causing a `ValueError` or `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the `clocs` (column locations) tuple is processed. We should extract the level numbers from the tuple of names (if provided) and use those numbers in subsequent operations instead of the names themselves.

### Code Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By checking if the input in `clocs` is a tuple, we ensure that we correctly handle both integer level numbers and tuple names, resolving the issue and preventing the `ValueError` or `KeyError` during `_get_level_number` calls.
