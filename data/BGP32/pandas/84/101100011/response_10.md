### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple()` is related to unstacking operations in pandas, specifically dealing with MultiIndex objects. The function aims to unstack a DataFrame based on the provided column levels.

The issue is related to unstacking MultiIndex columns with tuple names. The error occurs when attempting to determine the level number for each column index provided through the `clocs` argument.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error likely occurs in the section where the function tries to determine the level number for each column index provided through `clocs` by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`. The issue seems to stem from handling the MultiIndex columns with tuple names.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the function `_unstack_multiple()` fails to correctly identify the level number corresponding to the column indexes provided in `clocs` when dealing with MultiIndex columns with tuple names. This leads to a KeyError when attempting to access levels that are identified incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function needs to appropriately handle the MultiIndex columns with tuple names when determining the level numbers associated with the column indexes provided in `clocs`. This may involve ensuring that the function understands the tuple name structure and correctly identifies the levels based on the provided parameters.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This correction addresses the issue by checking if the provided index in `clocs` is a tuple and then handling it accordingly when determining the level number. This adjustment should resolve the KeyError related to handling tuple names in MultiIndex columns.
