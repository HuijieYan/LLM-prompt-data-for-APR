### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking of MultiIndex data frames in pandas.
2. The bug occurs when processing MultiIndex columns that have tuple names. The bug specifically arises while trying to determine the level number of the column indices.
3. The buggy function is used when unstacking occurs with MultiIndex columns in the DataFrame.
4. The error message from the failing test indicates that the bug arises from the inability to find a specific level due to tuple naming in MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to the approach used to determine the level number of the column indices (`clocs`). Since the function does not handle the scenario of tuple names in MultiIndex columns, it tries to directly find the level number with the given name rather than handling tuple names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of column levels with tuple names. We should detect and differentiate tuple names from regular names in the MultiIndex columns. Then, adjust the algorithm to correctly identify the levels based on tuple names.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    col_names = index.names

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [col_names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [col_names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By checking if the column name is an instance of tuple before trying to get the level number, we can now handle the scenario of MultiIndex columns with tuple names correctly.

### Summary:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function was due to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns with tuple names. By modifying the approach to detect tuple names and adjusting level number retrieval accordingly, we can fix the bug and ensure proper unstacking of DataFrames with MultiIndex columns.
