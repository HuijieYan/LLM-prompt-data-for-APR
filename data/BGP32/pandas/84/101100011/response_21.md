### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` in the file `reshape.py` is supposed to handle the unstacking operation on MultiIndexed data. 
2. The issue seems to occur due to the use of tuple names in MultiIndex columns, as mentioned in the failing tests and GitHub issue.
3. The error is caused by `_unstack_multiple` trying to get the level number for a tuple name which isn't handled properly.
4. The buggy function should be modified to handle MultiIndex columns with tuple names correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of directly using `index._get_level_number(i)` for tuple names, we can make adjustments to handle MultiIndex columns with tuple names.
2. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the special case where tuple names in MultiIndex columns are present.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    multi_index_columns = isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and any(isinstance(name, tuple) for name in index.names)

    if multi_index_columns:
        clocs = [(i if isinstance(name, tuple) else index.names.index(i)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle the unstacking operation on MultiIndexed data with tuple names in columns correctly, resolving the issue indicated in the failing tests and GitHub.
