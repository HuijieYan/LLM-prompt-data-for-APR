### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is expected to manage the unstacking operation for MultiIndexes in pandas, but it fails to handle tuple names correctly. The bug arises from the function's handling of column locations (clocs) when working with MultiIndexes.

### Error Locations:
1. Converting clocs to level numbers: The issue arises when converting clocs (column locations) to level numbers. The function tries to find the level number using `_get_level_number`, causing a KeyError.
2. Handling tuple names: The function incorrectly processes tuple names within MultiIndexes, leading to errors during unstacking.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tuple names and levels within MultiIndexes. The function does not account for these specific cases, causing failures during unstacking operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes clocs (column locations) and handles tuple names within MultiIndexes. Proper identification and conversion of levels need to be implemented to ensure the correct unstacking of MultiIndexes with tuple names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

### Outcome:
The corrected function should now properly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and carry out the unstacking operation without raising KeyErrors or failing the provided tests.
