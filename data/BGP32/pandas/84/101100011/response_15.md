### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is part of the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` and is closely related to the `unstack` function in the same file.
2. The function aims to unstack a DataFrame or Series with multiple levels of hierarchical index while handling column unstacking.
3. The reported GitHub issue indicates a KeyError related to handling tuple names in multi-index unstacking.
4. The bug seems to arise from the `_get_level_number` method used to process the levels during unstacking.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the faulty handling of tuple names in multi-index unstacking. Specifically, the `_get_level_number` method is not functioning correctly when tuple names are involved. This leads to a KeyError indicating that a specific level (e.g., 'A') is not found. The bug arises from incorrect processing of tuple names during the unstacking operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names correctly within multi-index unstacking.
2. Ensure that tuple names are parsed correctly and mapped to the corresponding levels in the multi-index structure.
3. Adjust the logic of level extraction to include tuple names if present in the index structure.
4. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly identify levels with tuple names and process them accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Support for tuple names in multi-index unstacking
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else (i,) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

Applying the above corrections address the issue related to tuple names in the multi-index unstacking process and should allow the function to perform as intended, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
