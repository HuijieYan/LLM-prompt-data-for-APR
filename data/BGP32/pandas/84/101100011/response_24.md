### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking of multiple data frames with multiple levels of indices.
2. The bug is likely due to how the levels are handled when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.
3. The bug is identified in the line: `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line is used to get the level number for each specified level name, and the bug seems to be related to handling tuple names properly.
4. The bug causes a KeyError when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case when tuple names are involved in the level names. Specifically, we need to ensure that the level names are appropriately parsed and handled when unstacking the data frame.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] if not isinstance(clocs[i], tuple) else clocs[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

Applying this correction should handle the issue when unstacking MultiIndexes with tuple names, resolving the KeyError and passing the failing test case.
