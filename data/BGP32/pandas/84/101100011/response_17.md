## Analysis
The bug is related to the `unstack` operation with a tuple name in a `MultiIndex`. The error occurs when attempting to find the level number using the `_get_level_number` function. The issue arises due to the incorrect processing of levels in the `clocs` list within the `_unstack_multiple` function. This bug causes `KeyError` to be raised, resulting in the failure of the `unstack` operation.

## Error Location
The error occurs in the lines:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when using the `unstack` operation with tuple names in `MultiIndex`, the levels are not processed correctly. The `_get_level_number` function expects an integer level, not a tuple, causing a `KeyError` when tuple names are used. The incorrect processing of levels in the `clocs` list leads to this error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to extract the correct level number based on the tuple name by iterating over the multi-level index names and comparing them with the tuple names.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_nums = [index.get_loc_for_level(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_nums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
```

This corrected version identifies the level numbers for the tuple names correctly, addressing the `KeyError` issue during the `unstack` operation.
