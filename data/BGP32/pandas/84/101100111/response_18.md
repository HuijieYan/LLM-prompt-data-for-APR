### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the handling of hierarchical columns. In the cases mentioned above, the function fails to handle tuple names properly, resulting in a `KeyError`. The issue arises from the way levels are extracted and processed within the function. 

1. The function attempts to get the level number for each element in `clocs` based on the index of the data provided. This process encounters a `KeyError` due to the presence of tuple names instead of simple strings for hierarchical indexing, leading to inconsistency in level identification.

2. The next steps involving the determination of row and column levels, encoding codes for grouping, and re-constructing the codes are dependent on the correct identification of levels which fail due to the initial error in level extraction.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to handle hierarchical column names correctly. It should be updated to support tuple names within the MultiIndex, ensuring that the levels are processed appropriately even when dealing with nested column indices.

1. Modify the logic for extracting level numbers within `_unstack_multiple` to handle tuple names for hierarchical columns.
2. Adjust the group indexing, compression, and reconstruction steps to account for the hierarchical nature of the columns.
3. Ensure that the new levels, codes, and names generated for unstacked data consider the multi-level structure of column indices.
4. Update the rebuilding of the columns with the newly formed MultiIndex, incorporating tuple names as necessary.

### Bug-free Function Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Capture the proper levels for both row and column indices
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(l) if isinstance(l, tuple) else index.names.index((l,)) for l in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Additional code implementation based on the extracted levels for handling tuple names

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By fixing the level extraction logic and adapting the subsequent processing steps to accommodate tuple names in MultiIndex columns, the corrected function should now handle the unstacking of DataFrames with hierarchical column indices effectively.
