The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of multi-index naming within the input tuples. The function does not correctly identify the levels for unstacking due to the mismatch in parsing tuple names. To address this bug, the function needs to properly index based on the multi-index names provided in the input parameter.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations for multi-indexed data.
2. In the given test cases, tuple names like `('A', 'a')` are used to specify the levels to unstack. However, the function currently fails to correctly identify the levels from tuple names due to improper processing.
3. The bug leads to a `KeyError` when the function tries to extract level numbers from the index using the provided tuple names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function `_get_level_number` needs to properly handle tuple names when extracting the levels from the index. Specifically, when processing tuple names, it should iterate over the tuples and extract the respective levels correctly.

### Updated `_unstack_multiple` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract level numbers correctly from the tuple names
    clocs = [index.get_loc_level(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    # ...
    # Ensure to adjust any references to the level numbers based on the corrected list indexing

    return unstacked
```

By implementing this fix, the function should be able to properly extract index level numbers using the provided tuple names, thus resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
