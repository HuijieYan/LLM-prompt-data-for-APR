### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to handle unstacking of data frames with multiple levels, particularly for hierarchical columns.
2. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect processing of hierarchical column names when unstacking.
3. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` demonstrates the bug due to an error in handling tuple names in MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly processes `clocs`, expecting integer indexes directly, but in the failing test, `clocs` contains tuple names such as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`.
2. The `_get_level_number` method is called with the tuple names, causing a KeyError when attempting to find `'A'` directly (line 317).
3. This mismatch causes the subsequent processing of columns during unstacking to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the processing of `clocs` to handle tuple names correctly by converting them to level numbers before further processing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Correct tuples to level numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
  
    # Remaining code remains the same
``` 

By applying this modification, the function will correctly process the tuple names in the `clocs` parameter, thereby fixing the bug related to unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex columns.
