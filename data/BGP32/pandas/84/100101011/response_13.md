### Analysis:
1. The `data` argument is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex containing tuple names like `('A', 'a')`.
2. The `clocs` variable is passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`.
3. The bug occurs during the index setup where the level names are used.
4. The error arises when trying to get the level number for each entry in `clocs` using `_get_level_number`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` function in the DataFrame's index expects integer level numbers rather than tuple names like `('A', 'a')`. Hence, it raises a KeyError causing the function to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Create a mapping between the tuple names and their respective level numbers.
2. Use this mapping to convert tuple names to level numbers for further processing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Mapping tuple names to level numbers
    name_to_level = {name: i for i, name in enumerate(data.index.names)}
    
    clocs = [name_to_level[name] if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in clocs]

    # Remaining code stays the same
    ...
```

This corrected version ensures that tuple names are converted to their corresponding level numbers before further processing, fixing the key error issue.
