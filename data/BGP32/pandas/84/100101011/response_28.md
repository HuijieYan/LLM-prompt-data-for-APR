### Bug Analysis:
The main issue causing the failure in the provided test cases is related to handling MultiIndexed data in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is intended to unstack the data based on specified levels of the MultiIndex columns, but it encounters errors when dealing with tuple names in MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Location:
The error is arising from the attempt to find the level number for a given tuple name in the MultiIndex columns. The function fails to correctly identify the indices associated with the tuple names, causing KeyErrors and subsequent failures.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function fails to properly extract the level numbers for tuple names within the MultiIndex columns.
2. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of tuple names when transforming the MultiIndex data structure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be modified to correctly identify and handle tuple names within MultiIndex columns. Properly determining the level numbers associated with tuple names is crucial for the unstacking process to work as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the identified bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    # Extract level numbers for tuple names in MultiIndex columns
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same as it handles the unstacking process
    ...
```

By updating the handling of `clocs` in the function to properly extract level numbers for tuple names in MultiIndex columns, the bug should be resolved, and the function should be able to correctly unstack the data according to the provided test cases.
