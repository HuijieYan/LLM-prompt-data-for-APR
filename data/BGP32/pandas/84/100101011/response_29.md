### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for unstacking a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.
2. The function is trying to deal with hierarchical columns, but currently does not handle them correctly.
3. The bug is likely present in the section where the function is handling the `clocs` (levels to unstack) provided as a tuple of names.
4. The bug is causing a Key Error when trying to get the level number based on the name.
5. The failing test is associated with a GitHub issue that points out a similar unstacking problem when using tuple names.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the case when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of names.
2. When trying to get the level numbers based on the provided names, it fails to handle the tuple format correctly, leading to a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the position in the code where it tries to use the `clocs` as names and update it to handle tuple names correctly.
2. Use a meaningful error handling method to address the Key Error issue encountered in the current implementation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Fix handling tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    # Remaining code stays the same
```

Applying this fix will handle the tuple names provided in the `clocs` parameter correctly, resolving the Key Error issue and allowing the function to function as intended.
