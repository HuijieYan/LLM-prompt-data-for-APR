### Bug Explanation:

The issue occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when dealing with MultiIndex columns and attempting to unstack based on tuple names. The function fails to correctly handle the tuples as column names and encounters a Key Error because it does not handle hierarchical columns effectively.

### Bug Location:

The bug is located in the initial processing where the `clocs` are extracted. The function assumes that the `clocs` are single-level but fails to address the multi-level columns correctly, leading to the KeyError during unstacking operations.

### Solution Strategy:

To fix this bug, the function must properly handle hierarchical columns when extracting the `clocs` and adjust subsequent operations accordingly. The correct approach is to first check if the `clocs` are hierarchical indices and then extract the level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc_levels = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in loc]
            cloc_level_numbers.extend(loc_levels)
        else:
            cloc_level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # remaining code for unstacking operations...
```

By modifying the extraction of level numbers for the `clocs` and adjusting the subsequent operations to handle multi-level columns effectively, the corrected function should be able to successfully unstack based on tuple names in MultiIndex columns.

### Outcome:

Applying this correction should resolve the Key Error issue and allow the unstacking operation on MultiIndex columns with tuple names to work correctly.
