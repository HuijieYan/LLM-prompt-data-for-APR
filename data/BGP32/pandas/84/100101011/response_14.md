### Issue Analysis
The issue arises when attempting to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns where the levels are defined as tuples. The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function and specifically in the part where the column levels are being handled.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by how the function handles the column levels when converting the DataFrame to a MultiIndex format. Specifically, the issue arises from the identification of the levels in the column index, which doesn't correctly recognize tuple names in the MultiIndex columns, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the function to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex columns. We should modify the way the function processes and identifies the column levels to address this issue and ensure proper unstacking of the DataFrame.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns correctly
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data.copy()
        for level in clocs:
            level_name = level if isinstance(level, str) else level[0]
            result = result.unstack(level_name, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By modifying the function to properly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex columns while unstacking, the corrected function should now be able to handle the provided failing test cases and address the GitHub issue.
