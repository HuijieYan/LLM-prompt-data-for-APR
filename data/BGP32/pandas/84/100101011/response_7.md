### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of multiple index levels, but it fails when dealing with tuple names in a MultiIndex.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to get the level number for each item in `clocs` by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`. This error arises because the function `_get_level_number` expects a string level name but encounters a tuple.
3. The failing test cases provide MultiIndex structures and unstack operations that lead to KeyError or ValueErrors due to this bug.
4. The bug is affecting the unstacking functionality of DataFrames and causing problems during level number retrieval.

### Bug Cause:
The function tries to handle multiple index levels by retrieving the level numbers. When encountering tuple names in the MultiIndex, the function mistakenly expects a single string level name, leading to a KeyError or a ValueError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to properly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex.
2. Update the logic to correctly retrieve the level number corresponding to tuple names.
3. Ensure that the function can process both single string level names and tuple names without errors.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    # Extract the level numbers corresponding to clocs
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By checking if the item in `clocs` is a string or a tuple name when getting the level number, the corrected function can handle both cases appropriately. This modification should resolve the KeyError issue caused by tuple names in the MultiIndex.
