### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from how the function handles the column levels represented by tuples. Specifically, when processing the `clocs` (column locations) parameter, the function intends to extract the level indices based on the names provided. However, the bug occurs in the code segment:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This code is supposed to map the tuple names to their corresponding level indices in the MultiIndex. Nevertheless, it encounters an issue when trying to find the level number for child elements within a tuple instead of single level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the tuple-like column labels. One approach is to modify the mechanism for resolving level numbers in MultiIndex. Rather than directly using the `index._get_level_number(i)` method, we should check if the provided `clocs` elements are tuples (indicating MultiIndex labels) and process them accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the tuple name issue:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By incorporating the conditional check within the list comprehension, we now handle both single-level names and tuple names correctly to determine the levels needed for unstacking the DataFrame.
