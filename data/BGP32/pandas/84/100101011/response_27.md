### Bug Analysis:
The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` function not being able to handle tuple names in MultiIndex, resulting in a KeyError during the unstacking operation. This occurs because the `clocs` (columns to unstack) are tuples representing the column names, and when trying to get the level number, the `Index._get_level_number` function is unable to process tuples.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is in the `_unstack_multiple` function where `clocs` are converted to level numbers using `_get_level_number` in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This results in the KeyError as explained above.

### Bug Cause:
The issue occurs because the code is assuming that `clocs` are always directly convertible to level numbers, but for MultiIndex with tuple names, this conversion fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle tuple names in MultiIndex when obtaining level numbers. We should add a conditional check to differentiate between simple level names and tuple names so that the conversion behaves correctly for both cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs_level_number = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_names = []
            for name in cloc:
                try:
                    cloc_names.append(index.names.index(name))
                except ValueError:
                    raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(name))
            clocs_level_number.append(tuple(cloc_names))
        else:
            try:
                clocs_level_number.append(index.names.index(cloc))
            except ValueError:
                raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_level_number]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_level_number]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_level_number]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_level_number]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By making the above changes to handle the case where `clocs` can be tuples with multi-level names, we can resolve the KeyError issue and make the function compatible with MultiIndex having tuple names.
