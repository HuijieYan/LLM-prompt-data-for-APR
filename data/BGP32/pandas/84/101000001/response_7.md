### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack data based on specified column locations. It involves restructuring the data based on certain conditions and then unstacking it to create a new DataFrame or Series with appropriate index or columns.

### Potential error locations:
1. Mistake in indexing level in this line: `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.
2. Issue with handling hierarchical columns.
3. Incorrect handling of different data types (Series vs DataFrame).
4. Potential inconsistency in accessing `unstacked` object for Series and DataFrame.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in this function arises from inconsistent handling of the `unstacked` object based on whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame. The function is mistakenly accessing different attributes of `unstacked` for Series and DataFrame, causing inconsistency in the code execution flow and potentially leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of the `unstacked` object based on whether it is a Series or DataFrame. This involves accessing the correct attributes depending on the type of `unstacked` and making necessary adjustments to the index or columns accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the code structure has been updated to ensure consistent handling of the `unstacked` object based on its type (Series or DataFrame). The corrections include accessing the appropriate attributes like `names` and `levels` based on the type of object, avoiding potential inconsistency and fixing the bug in the process.
