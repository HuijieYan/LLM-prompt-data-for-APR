### Analysis:
The `def _unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack a multi-level index dataframe. It retrieves information about the index levels, codes, names, and then performs unstacking based on the specified levels. There are two main branches in the function, one for `Series` objects and the other for general dataframes. Within each branch, unstacking is performed differently.

### Identified Issue:
The bug occurs in the branch handling general dataframes when the `unstacked` variable is checked for its type to determine if it should access `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns`. The check `if isinstance(unstacked, Series)` or `if isinstance(unstacked, Series):` is incorrect because `unstacked` will always be a DataFrame in that branch, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access `unstacked.columns`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect type check of `unstacked`, which results in accessing the wrong attribute (`columns` instead of `index`).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct attribute (`index`) is accessed when `unstacked` is a DataFrame and not a Series. This can be achieved by removing the incorrect type check and handling the DataFrame case directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected _unstack_multiple function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.index
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version removes the unnecessary type check `if isinstance(unstacked, Series)` and directly accesses `unstacked.index` to retrieve the levels in the case when `unstacked` is a DataFrame. This change ensures that the correct attribute is accessed and resolves the AttributeError that was occurring in the original buggy function.
