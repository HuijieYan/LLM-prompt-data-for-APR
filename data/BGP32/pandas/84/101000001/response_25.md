Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The calculation and manipulation of clocs, rlocs, clevels, ccodes, rlevels, rcodes, cnames, and rnames could be incorrect.
2. Handling of different instances of 'data' (Series or DataFrame) might cause issues.
3. Incorrect handling of unstacked object based on its type (Series or DataFrame) could lead to errors.

Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame object along multiple columns. However, there are several potential sources of error within the function:
1. The calculation and manipulation of levels, codes, and names related to the index might not be correct, leading to inconsistencies.
2. The handling of different instances of 'data' (Series or DataFrame) lacks clarity, potentially causing issues during the unstacking process.
3. The code for updating the columns or index after unstacking may not be handling the objects appropriately, leading to unexpected results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure accurate calculation and manipulation of levels, codes, and names related to the index to maintain consistency.
2. Clearly define the handling of different instances of 'data' (Series or DataFrame) to streamline the unstacking process.
3. Update the code for updating columns or index after unstacking to properly manage the objects based on their types.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the index and restructure based on clocs
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Create clevels, ccodes, cnames, rlevels, rcodes, rnames, and group_index
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Handle different instances of 'data' (Series or DataFrame)
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Unstack the dummy data and restructure columns or index accordingly
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
