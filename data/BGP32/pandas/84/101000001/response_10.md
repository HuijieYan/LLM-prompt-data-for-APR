### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series object based on given column locations. The function uses the provided `clocs` (column locations) to determine how to unstack the data. However, there are issues in the code that can lead to bugs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reassigning the `clocs` variable inside the loop for unstacking MultiIndex columns.
2. Inconsistency in manipulating `clocs` for unstacking MultiIndex columns.
3. Incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns in different code paths.
4. Potential issues with setting the new index or columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when unstacking a MultiIndex DataFrame, the `clocs` variable is modified inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect unstacking due to the shifting positions. This results in misalignment of the columns during the unstacking process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to maintain the integrity of the `clocs` variable when unstacking MultiIndex columns. Additionally, we should ensure consistency in handling DataFrame and Series objects when reconstructing the new columns.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
        
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

In this corrected version, the manipulation of `clocs` has been removed for the case where MultiIndex columns are involved. The code now maintains integrity in handling both Series and DataFrame objects during the unstacking process.
