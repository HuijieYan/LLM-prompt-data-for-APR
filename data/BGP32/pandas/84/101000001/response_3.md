Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The section where `rlocs` is defined and `rlevels` and `rcodes` are extracted from `index` may lead to issues if `rlocs` is empty.
2. The condition where the type of `data` is checked might cause problems when handling `data.columns` for MultiIndex data.

Explanation of the bug:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of data along multiple levels, but it doesn't account for scenarios where all levels are provided in `clocs` and `rlocs` is empty.
2. The handling of different data types for `data` (Series or DataFrame) can lead to incorrect results or errors.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. To address the issue when `rlocs` is empty, modify the flow to appropriately handle this case, possibly by checking and handling it separately to avoid errors.
2. Ensure consistent handling of `data` across different types (Series or DataFrame) to generate correct results during unstacking.

After considering the potential issues, fixing the bug and addressing the identified points, here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if not rlocs:
        # Handling the case where all levels are already in clocs
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.index if isinstance(unstacked, Series) else unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

This corrected version considers the scenario where all levels are in `clocs`, and ensures consistent handling of `data` to provide the expected unstacked output.
