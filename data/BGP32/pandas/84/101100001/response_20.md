### Analyzing the buggy function and its related functions:

The `unstack` function is a helper function used by the `_unstack_multiple` function. The `_unstack_multiple` function is responsible for unstacking a DataFrame based on the specified columns, grouping them, and creating a new MultiIndex for the resulting DataFrame.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The reassignment of the `clocs` variable within the loop for unstacking DataFrame columns might lead to issues.
2. The generation of the new Columns MultiIndex might have potential issues.
3. Handling of Series and DataFrame objects might not be consistent in the function.
4. The creation of the `dummy_index` variable for unstacking could be causing problems.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function causes incorrect unstacking behavior for MultiIndex columns in a DataFrame. The issue can be seen in the failing test where the expected result does not match the actual result due to incorrect unstacking and column naming.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the column unstacking loop correctly handles and maintains the order of columns.
2. Verify the generation of the new Columns MultiIndex based on the unstacked columns.
3. Implement consistent handling for both Series and DataFrame objects in the function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
    else:
        dummy = data.reset_index()

    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version aims to address the identified potential error locations and ensure proper unstacking behavior for MultiIndex columns in the DataFrame.
