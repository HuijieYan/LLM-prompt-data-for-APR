### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to correctly handle the unstacking process for a DataFrame with a multi-level index. The bug is causing the output to be incorrect, leading to test failures. The function tries to unstack the DataFrame based on the specified levels, but it has issues dealing with hierarchical columns and reconstructing the index correctly after unstacking.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring when reconstructing the index after unstacking the DataFrame. The handling of hierarchical columns and index reconstruction for multi-level indexes is faulty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of hierarchical columns, improper reconstruction of the index, and inconsistencies in determining the levels, codes, and names for the new columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of hierarchical columns during unstacking.
2. Reconstruct the index correctly after unstacking, considering multi-level indexes.
3. Maintain consistency in determining levels, codes, and names for new columns based on the unstacking operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = clevels + [obs_ids]
    new_names = cnames + ["__placeholder__"]
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function takes into account the correct reconstruction of the index for multi-level columns and maintains consistency in determining the levels, codes, and names for the new columns. This version should pass the failing test cases provided.
