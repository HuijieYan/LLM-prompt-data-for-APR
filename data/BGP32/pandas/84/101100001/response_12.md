### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on multiple levels. The function is trying to reconstruct a new index based on the given column locations and their associated levels in the existing index. The bug seems to be related to the logic used for handling hierarchical columns and creating the new index.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the section of the code that constructs the new index and assigns it back to the unstacked data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex structures when reconstructing the new index. The code does not correctly account for the hierarchy of columns while building the new MultiIndex.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. When reconstructing the new MultiIndex for the unstacked data, ensure that the hierarchy of columns is preserved.
2. Make sure to assign the new index correctly based on whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product([unstacked.columns.levels[0]] + clevels, names=[data.columns.name] + cnames)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the unstacking of data with nested MultiIndex structures and pass the failing test cases provided.
