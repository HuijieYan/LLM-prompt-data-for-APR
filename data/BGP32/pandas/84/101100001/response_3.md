Analyzing the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, we can see that the function is trying to unstack the input data based on specified column locations and generate new index/column levels and codes accordingly. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function is not properly handling the case where there are hierarchical columns.
2. The logic for creating new index levels and codes based on the unstacked data is incorrect.
3. There are issues with handling the input data as either a Series or a DataFrame.

To fix these issues, we need to revise the logic for creating new index levels and codes, handle hierarchical columns correctly, and improve the handling of input data as either a Series or a DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index-related information
    index = data.index
    clevel_nums = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlevel_nums = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_nums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_nums]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlevel_nums]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Handle input data as Series
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Handle input data as DataFrame
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
        [("",) * len(clocs) + col for col in unstacked.columns],
        names=rnames + cnames,
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should now pass the failing tests provided. Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to confirm the fix.
