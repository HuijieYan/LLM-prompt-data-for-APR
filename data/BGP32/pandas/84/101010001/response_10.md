## Analysis:
The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of multi-level indexes when trying to unstack the data. The function `_get_level_number` is returning an error when trying to find the index of a specified level because it is not correctly recognizing the multi-level index names.

## Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring in the section where the `names` attribute of the index is used to determine the level number. The implementation of `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is problematic when dealing with multi-level indexes.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by the attempt to extract the level number based on the index names. In the case of multi-level indexes, the function `_get_level_number` is not correctly identifying the levels due to the naming structure of the levels in the index.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for extracting the level number to account for multi-level indexes.
2. Instead of using the index names directly, check each level in the MultiIndex object and compare it to the requested level to get the correct level number.
3. Handle the case where the level is part of a tuple by recursively searching through each level.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        level_found = False
        for i, level in enumerate(index.names):
            if cloc == level or cloc in level:  # Allowing for tuple-like identifiers
                cloc_numbers.append(i)
                level_found = True
                break
        if not level_found:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {cloc} not found in the index")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By iterating over each level in the MultiIndex object and comparing it to the requested level, we can correctly determine the level number even in the case of multi-level indexes. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to unstack multi-level index data.
