### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class. The error message indicates that the level being passed to `_get_level_number` is not found in the list of names. This issue stems from passing a tuple (`('A', 'a')`) to `_get_level_number`, while it expects single levels as strings. This inconsistency causes a failure in identifying the level correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is passing a tuple (`('A', 'a')`) representing multiple levels instead of the single level string needed by the `_get_level_number` function. As a result, the function tries to find the tuple as-is in the list of names, leading to the KeyError or ValueError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the input correctly in the `_unstack_multiple` function so that it passes single-level strings to `_get_level_number`. This can be achieved by converting tuples to strings when determining the levels of interest.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]  # Convert tuples to strings

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By converting the levels of interest to strings before passing them to `_get_level_number`, we ensure that the function can correctly locate the levels in the list of names, resolving the KeyError or ValueError issues.
