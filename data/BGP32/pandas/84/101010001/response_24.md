### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method, where the method is trying to locate a level by its name within a MultiIndex. However, the method is throwing an error because it is expecting the level name in the form of a tuple, but it is provided as a single string, causing the given level name `'A'` not to be found in the list of level names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing a single string as the level name instead of a tuple of strings. The method `_get_level_number` expects a tuple with multiple elements as the level name but receives only a single string, leading to the error.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Detect when the level name is a single string and convert it into a tuple with that string as the only element.
2. This conversion should be done before calling the `_get_level_number` method to avoid the KeyError and ValueError.
3. The fix should focus on changing the level name format to match the expected format for the `_get_level_number` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]  # Convert to tuple

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
```

By converting the level name from a single string to a tuple with that string as an element before calling `_get_level_number`, we can resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues.
