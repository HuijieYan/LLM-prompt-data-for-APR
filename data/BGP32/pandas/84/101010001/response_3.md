### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to the incorrect handling of input values related to levels in MultiIndex objects. The function is trying to retrieve the level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method, but due to the way the levels are passed as parameters, it causes errors related to `KeyError` or `ValueError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `clocs` as level names or numbers may be causing the issue.
2. The function is not correctly handling the input format for level specifications.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the function is expecting level names as input but the code is trying to retrieve their numerical positions directly from the Index object, leading to key errors or value errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first identify whether the input is provided as level names or numbers. If they are names, we should directly use them. If they are numbers, we should interpret them as indices instead of level names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    levels = index.names

    clocs = [c if isinstance(c, int) else levels.index(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    level_names = [levels[i] for i in clocs]
    codes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clocs]
    group_index = get_group_index(codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, codes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version dynamically handles the input whether it's level names or numbers and retrieves the level positions or interprets them correctly based on the input.
