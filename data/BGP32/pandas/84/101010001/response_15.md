## Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line where it tries to extract the level number of the passed columns `clocs` using `index._get_level_number(i)`. The underlying issue is that `index._get_level_number(i)` is expecting a level name to find its corresponding level number but is instead receiving a level tuple `(A', 'a')` or just `'A'`. This results in a `ValueError` or `KeyError` since it is unable to find the provided level name within the list of names of the MultiIndex.

## Bug Location:
The issue lies in the way the function is handling the extraction of level numbers from the passed column names. The function expects to operate on level names directly, but the columns are actually tuples or single strings resulting in the error.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `clocs` contains only level names which can be directly used to index into the names attribute of the MultiIndex. However, in some cases, like when tuples are used as level names, the function fails to extract the level number causing the error to be raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` list contains level names, not tuples or other unexpected data types. We can modify the way the columns are passed to the function, especially in the failing test cases, to ensure that the function receives a list of level names. Then, we need to adjust the code within the `_unstack_multiple` function to accommodate this change.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Import relevant modules and functions

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version modifes the way `clocs` are processed, checking if each item is a string and extracting the level number accordingly. This modification should resolve the issue by ensuring that only level names are used to extract level numbers in the subsequent steps.
