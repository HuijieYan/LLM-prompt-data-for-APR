### Analysis:
- The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to handle unstacking operations for multi-level indexes in pandas.
- The error occurs when trying to find the level number corresponding to the provided level name (`'A'` in this case) in the MultiIndex object. The error messages indicate issues related to locating the specified level.
- The `clocs` list contains levels to be unstacked, and these levels should be converted into integer level numbers within the MultiIndex object for further processing.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to an incorrect naming convention. The levels of the MultiIndex are stored as tuples, but the function expects single names for levels.
- When trying to find the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`, it fails because the comparison with single strings fails on tuples that represent the levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the level names provided are in the same format as the level names stored in the MultiIndex object. In this case, the level names should be single strings, not tuples.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Converting level names to single strings
    clocs = [i if isinstance(i, str) else i[0] for i in clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    # Rest of the function follows as it is...
```

### Summary:
- The bug was caused by a mismatch in the expected level names format. By correcting the format of the level names to match the structure stored in the MultiIndex object, we resolved the issue.
