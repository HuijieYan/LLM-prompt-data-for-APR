### Analysis:
The `KeyError` and `ValueError` exceptions are being raised in the `_get_level_number` method within the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module. These exceptions are triggered by the `_unstack_multiple` function when attempting to extract the level numbers based on the given names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `MultiIndex` name is a tuple in the failing test cases, but the `_get_level_number` function expects a single name string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the name is a tuple by converting it to a single string if necessary before passing it to the `_get_level_number` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple name to single name if necessary
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        tuple_name = clocs
        if isinstance(tuple_name, tuple):
            cloc_names = ["_".join(map(str, tuple_name))]
        else:
            cloc_names = [tuple_name]
        
        clocs = [index.get_loc(name) for name in cloc_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By making this adjustment to handle multi-index names, the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should now properly extract and utilize the level numbers, resolving the `KeyError` and `ValueError` issues.
