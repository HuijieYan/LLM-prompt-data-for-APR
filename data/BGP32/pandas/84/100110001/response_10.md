### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling unstacking of DataFrame columns based on multiple levels. The error occurs when attempting to unstack based on a tuple name in a MultiIndex. The function incorrectly assumes that the level provided is a string and tries to find its index in the column names, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the level provided for unstacking is a string name present in the index, whereas in the failing tests, the level is actually a tuple name pair in a MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the function needs to account for the possibility of the level being a tuple name in the MultiIndex. Instead of directly looking up the index of the provided level, we need to check for the tuple level in the index names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

Applying this fix will handle cases where the level to unstack is provided as a tuple name in a MultiIndex, resolving the error and ensuring the correct unstacking behavior.
