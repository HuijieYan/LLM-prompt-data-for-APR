### Analysis:
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function is meant to handle unstacking operations with multiple columns as input. It processes the data and columns to create a new DataFrame with a MultiIndex.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to get the level number for a specific column from the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `clocs` (column locations) are handled and transformed into level numbers in the index object. This leads to the function not being able to find the specified level.
4. The error message indicates that the function is trying to find a level that does not exist in the MultiIndex, causing it to raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The issue seems to be with the transformation of column locations (`clocs`) into level numbers in the index. Reevaluating how the `clocs` are processed might be necessary.
2. Ensure that the correct columns are being selected and processed based on the provided column locations (`clocs`).
3. Validate the logic for extracting levels, codes, and names from both rows and columns.
4. Use appropriate error handling mechanisms to deal with issues related to level and column identification.

### Updated and Corrected `_unstack_multiple` Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Check for tuple location

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
    ...
    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

By adjusting the processing of `clocs`, specifically checking for tuple locations and making the necessary transformations, we can address the bug and ensure the function works correctly with multi-index columns.
