### Analysis
The `KeyError` and `ValueError` in the error messages indicate that there is an issue with the `index._get_level_number(i)` method call in the `_unstack_multiple` function. This method is trying to get the level number for a given level name, but it's failing to find the level name in the list of names.

### Potential Error
The potential error lies in how the function is handling the `clocs` variable, which represents the column locations. It's trying to convert level names into level numbers, but the names might not match with the available levels in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `clocs` contain level names that may not exist in the index levels. This discrepancy causes the function to raise errors when attempting to convert the names to level numbers. As a result, the function fails to unstack the DataFrame correctly, leading to failed tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level names provided in `clocs` actually exist in the index levels. If a provided name doesn't match any of the existing level names, an appropriate handling mechanism should be implemented to prevent errors.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else None for i in clocs]

    # Filter out None values from clocs
    clocs = [c for c in clocs if c is not None]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

With this correction, we first check if the name in `clocs` exists in the index names before trying to get its level number. If the name doesn't exist in the index, we set its corresponding entry in `clocs` to `None` and filter out those `None` values before proceeding with the rest of the function. This modification ensures that only valid level names are converted to level numbers.
