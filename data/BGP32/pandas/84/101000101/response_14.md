### Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack data based on specified column locations. It involves handling hierarchical columns and transforming the data accordingly. The function is applied differently based on whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame.

### Bugs and Causes
1. The main issue lies in the reindexing process of the DataFrame `unstacked`, where incorrect assignments to `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` are made based on the assumption that `unstacked` is always a Series.
2. In the case where `data.columns` is not a MultiIndex, but the function behaves as if it is a MultiIndex, leading to incorrect behavior and output.
3. The assumption of handling hierarchical columns needs to be considered and integrated properly along with the multi-level indexing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs
1. Ensure proper recognition of whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame to handle the unstacking procedure correctly based on the data structure.
2. Adjust the procedure for handling hierarchical columns, especially in the case of multiple levels of column indices.
3. Refine the logic for reconstructing the DataFrame post-unstacking according to the correct indexes structure.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index information
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    else:
        clevels = [data.columns.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [data.columns.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [data.columns.names[i] for i in clocs]
        rlevels = [data.columns.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [data.columns.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [data.columns.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Process unstacking based on DataFrame or Series structure
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name='__placeholder__')
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids], codes=rcodes + [comp_ids], names=rnames + ['__placeholder__'], verify_integrity=False)
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]]

        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    # Adjust the columns or index based on the resulting structure
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle both Series and DataFrame inputs, as well as hierarchical columns, providing the expected output for the given test cases.
