### Analysis
The `buggy` function `_unstack_multiple` aims to unstack data based on specified levels `clocs`. It extracts necessary information from the input data and creates a new structure based on the levels provided. There are several potential issues in the current implementation that need to be addressed to fix the bug.
1. The function is not handling hierarchical columns appropriately.
2. The handling of unstacking for different data types (DataFrame, Series) needs improvement.

### Bug Explanation
The bug exists within the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the incorrect operations to manipulate the given data structure. The function incorrectly creates the new index and columns during the unstacking process. This leads to misalignment between the actual data and its corresponding labels, resulting in incorrect unstacking.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles hierarchical and non-hierarchical data structures. We should adjust the code related to creating the new index and columns based on the specified levels (`clocs`). Additionally, the handling of different types of data (DataFrame, Series) should be honed to guarantee correct unstacking for each type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function addresses the issues mentioned above by ensuring the correct creation of new indexes and columns based on the provided levels (`clocs`). It also considers the data type (DataFrame, Series) while handling the unstacking process for accurate results.
