The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the incorrect assignment of the variable `rlocs`, which is calculated as the difference between all levels and the chosen clocs levels. However, in the case of multiple levels, clocs can be a tuple where only the first element needs to be extracted. 

To fix this bug, we should properly handle cases where `clocs` is a tuple by extracting the first element for further processing. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc = clocs[0] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs
    cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i != cloc_number]

    clevels = [index.levels[cloc_number]]
    ccodes = [index.codes[cloc_number]]
    cnames = [index.names[cloc_number]]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version correctly handles the case where clocs can be a tuple and extracts the first element to determine the column level number. The rest of the function remains the same as before.
