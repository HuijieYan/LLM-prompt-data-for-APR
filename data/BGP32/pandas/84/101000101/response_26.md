### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to convert a DataFrame with a MultiIndex into another DataFrame with a different hierarchy. However, there are issues with how it handles the column levels and codes, causing incorrect output. The function incorrectly sets up the new levels, names, and codes resulting in a wrong transformation.

### Bugs Identified
1. Incorrect handling of the column levels, names, and codes in the case when the data is a DataFrame and not a Series.
2. Mistakes in defining new levels, names, and codes based on the logic applied to the unstacked object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs
1. Ensure proper handling of column hierarchy creation according to the new structure required.
2. Take into account the actual structure of the unstacked DataFrame for correct reorganization of columns.
3. Verify the values set for the new levels and codes to accurately represent the restructured DataFrame.

### Corrected Version of the Function
After addressing the bugs, below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids] + clevels
        new_names = rnames + ['__placeholder__'] + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version ensures that the new column structure is correctly determined based on the actual hierarchy of the DataFrame and the desired transformation.
