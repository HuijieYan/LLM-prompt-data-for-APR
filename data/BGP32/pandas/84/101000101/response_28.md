### Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is designed to unstack data based on certain column locations provided in `clocs`. The function interacts with various parts of the data's index and columns to perform the unstacking operation. The bug likely arises due to improper handling of hierarchical columns when unstacking. In the function's logic, there are multiple branches based on the data type passed, where different scenarios are considered for Series and DataFrame inputs.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns in the DataFrame input scenario. When attempting to unstack a DataFrame with hierarchical columns, the existing implementation wrongly manipulates the columns and their levels, resulting in incorrect unstacking of the data. This leads to an inconsistent reshaping of the data if there are multiple levels of columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper transitioning between the MultiIndex column structure of the input data and the reshaped data after unstacking. Adjustments should be made particularly in handling the column levels and codes during the unstacking process to avoid data misalignment. Additionally, the reconstruction of new columns after unstacking needs to be done accurately to retain the hierarchical structure correctly.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]  # Helper function to get level number

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected version, we address the incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns by ensuring proper reconstruction of new columns with correct levels and codes post-unstacking. Additionally, we correctly identify the level numbers to avoid restructuring issues when unstacking hierarchical columns in DataFrame input.
