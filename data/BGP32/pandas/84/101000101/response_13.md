### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is meant to perform unstacking operations on DataFrames with support for multiple indices. However, there is a bug that causes incorrect manipulation of the indices and columns in certain scenarios. The bug arises when the function encounters multi-level columns along with multi-level indices.

The issue lies in the code block where the type of data is checked. In the case when `data` is not an instance of `Series`, but its `columns` are of type `MultiIndex`, the function incorrectly unpacks the columns causing distortion in the unstacking process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code block that handles the case when `data` is not a `Series`. Instead of directly unstacking the data with column manipulations, we need to make sure that the multi-level column structure is preserved throughout the operation.

### Bug-fixed Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function taking into account the fix strategy mentioned above:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )

        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstacked.index = new_columns
        else:
            unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By ensuring the preservation of multi-level columns during the unstacking process, the corrected function should behave according to the expected variable values and types provided for all the test cases.
