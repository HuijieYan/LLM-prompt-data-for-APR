### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to incorrectly calculating the `rlocs` list which determines which levels should be considered in the resulting columns after unstacking. The issue lies in the calculation for `rlocs` and how it is being utilized in the subsequent steps to reconstruct the MultiIndex columns.

In the provided function, `rlocs` is constructed by finding levels that are not in `clocs`, which is appropriate. However, at the end of the function, when constructing the new columns for the unstacked DataFrame, it is not correctly utilizing the levels from `rlocs`. This faulty implementation leads to incorrect column ordering and misalignment of data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct levels are being used in the construction of the new MultiIndex columns. This involves correctly finding the levels that are not part of `clocs` and then appropriately utilizing them when creating the new MultiIndex.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [col_levels[0] for col_levels in unstacked.columns.levels]
        new_names = rnames + [data.columns.names[0]] + list(unstacked.columns.levels[1:])
        new_codes = rcodes + [col_codes[0] for col_codes in unstacked.columns.codes]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By using the levels and codes appropriately from `rlocs` and `clocs` in constructing the new MultiIndex columns, the corrected function should now produce the expected output for all provided test cases.
