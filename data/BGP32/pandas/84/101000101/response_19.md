### Analysis and Explanation
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` aims to perform unstacking operation on a DataFrame based on the given column levels (`clocs`).
2. The buggy function has several issues such as incorrectly determining the set of rows and columns for unstacking, errors in constructing `dummy_index`, and inconsistent handling based on the type of input data.
3. The primary cause of the bug appears to be the incorrect manipulation of variables related to row and column levels.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of row and column levels for unstacking and construct the new columns and index correctly based on the unstacking operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the row and column levels are correctly identified for unstacking.
2. Properly construct the new index (`dummy_index`) by including both the columns related to unstacking and the remnant levels.
3. Handle different types of input data properly to generate the new columns and index accordingly.
4. Adjust the codes for column reconstruction to address the inconsistencies observed in the previous version.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs_num = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_num]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_num]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_num]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_num]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                             codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                             names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
                             verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function addresses the issues related to the determination of levels, construction of `dummy_index`, and handling of different input data types. Now, the function should correctly unstack the DataFrame based on the provided column levels (`clocs`) and satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
