### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, is designed to perform unstacking operations on a DataFrame by reshaping the index based on given levels. The function extracts necessary information about the index and specific levels to operate correctly.

### Error Identification

The error occurs when the `_unstack_multiple` function attempts to retrieve the level numbers from the index based on the specified levels `clocs`. The expected `clocs` variable is a tuple in the function input, but later in the code, it is converted into a list for level number extraction. The bug lies in the incorrect handling of the tuple to list conversion, causing a KeyError later in the execution.

### Bug Cause

The bug causes a KeyError due to the incorrect way of transforming the tuple `clocs` into a list before extracting the level numbers. The bug originates from the transition of `clocs` from a tuple to a list, breaking the expected functionality of the function.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to handle the transformation of the tuple `clocs` to a list properly to ensure that the correct levels are used for further operations. By making sure that the conversion maintains the necessary structure, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Function

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if isinstance(i, str)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the transformation of the `clocs` tuple to a list only includes string elements to match the expectation. This modification fixes the bug and allows the function to operate correctly without encountering the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
