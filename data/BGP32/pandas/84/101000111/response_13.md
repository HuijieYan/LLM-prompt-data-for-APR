### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking data with multiple indices. It relies heavily on extracting and manipulating index levels and codes.
2. The bug seems to originate from incorrect handling of the columns when `data` is a DataFrame and not a Series. The bug arises when dealing with higher levels of a MultiIndex.
3. The `clocs` should contain the level numbers of the column that should be unstacked, but the code has a disconnection when setting their values.
4. The bug relates concisely to the GitHub issue mentioned where unstacking with tuple names fails with a KeyError. The error arises from incorrect level identification while trying to unstack the data. The `level` parameter should be correctly utilized to avoid such issues.
5. A strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring that the `clocs` variable is correctly determined based on the provided input parameters. Properly identifying the levels and reconstructing the data frame with the unstacked columns will resolve the issue.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # This needs to be added to transform 'clocs' from tuple to list if it's a tuple
    clocs = list(clocs) if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs
    
    # Rest of the existing code remains the same
``` 

By ensuring that `clocs` is transformed into a list if it's a tuple, we avoid the KeyError when trying to iterate over it in the subsequent code. This adjustment aligns with the expected input/output requirements and should correctly handle the unstacking operation.
