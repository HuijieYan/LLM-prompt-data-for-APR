### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to handle unstacking of DataFrame objects with multiple indices. 
2. The function extracts relevant information from the input DataFrame's index to understand the structure and then performs the unstacking operation accordingly.
3. The issue stems from the incorrect handling of the `clocs` input parameter, which is a tuple of names to be used as column levels during unstacking.
4. The cause of the bug is the improper transformation of tuple `clocs` into a list of level numbers for MultiIndex handling within the function.
5. To fix this bug, a strategy should involve correctly identifying the levels from the MultiIndex based on the tuple of names given in the input parameter `clocs`.
   
### Fix Strategy:
1. Determine the levels represented by the tuple of names in `clocs`.
2. Match these levels with the existing levels of the MultiIndex to get the level numbers.
3. Utilize these level numbers to proceed with the unstacking operation.
4. Return the unstacked DataFrame.
  
### Code Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]  # get the level numbers from the names in clocs

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By fixing the identification of level numbers from names represented in `clocs`, the function will correctly understand which levels to unstack when processing the input DataFrame.
