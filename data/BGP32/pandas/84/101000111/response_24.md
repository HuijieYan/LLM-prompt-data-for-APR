### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, aims to handle multiple unstacking operations in a DataFrame with hierarchical columns.
2. The function determines the position of columns to unstack by their levels using the `clocs` parameter.
3. The bug occurs when accessing the level number of a MultiIndex. It happens due to the incorrect way the `clocs` parameter is handled within the function, leading to erroneous level number identification.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `clocs` parameter is processed and ensure that the level numbers are correctly extracted from the MultiIndex.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the way level numbers are extracted using the column multi-index present in the input data. By properly identifying the level numbers, we can ensure that the unstacking operation functions correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_indices = [index.get_loc_level(i) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By replacing the incorrect `_get_level_number` method call with `get_loc_level`, we ensure that the level numbers are correctly calculated for unstacking the DataFrame with hierarchical columns. This adjustment should resolve the bug and allow the function to work as expected for the provided test cases.
