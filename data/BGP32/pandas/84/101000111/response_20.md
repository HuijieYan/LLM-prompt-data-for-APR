### Analysis:
1. The `DataFrame` passed to the `_unstack_multiple` function has a multi-index.
2. The `clocs` variable represents the levels of the multi-index to retain in the final unstacked result.
3. The code attempts to extract relevant information like index levels, codes, and names, process the data, and then reconstruct a new multi-index after unstacking.
4. The buggy function fails when handling multi-level columns.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the way the column levels are handled. The code specifically handling multi-index columns in the `else` block has two distinct processing paths for `Series` and non-`Series` data. When dealing with non-`Series` data, if the `unstacked` result is a `DataFrame`, the code tries to extract information using `unstcols`, which is for handling multi-index column levels of a Series.

This extraction leads to the code failing to find the expected structure when `unstacked` is a `DataFrame` because `DataFrame` columns don't have levels directly accessible in the same manner as `Series`.

### Fix Strategy:
A solution to fix the bug is to refactor the way levels and codes information is handled for both `Series` and `DataFrame` objects. By adjusting these parts of the code, we can ensure consistent handling of column levels during the unstacking process.

### Fix for the Buggy Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                              codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                              names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
                              verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This revised function ensures consistent handling of column levels for both `Series` and `DataFrame` objects during unstacking, addressing the bug described above.
