### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` takes the `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` parameters, and it aims to perform unstacking on the input data to reshape it. The expected behavior includes handling multi-index columns and restructuring the data accordingly.
   
2. The bug occurs at the stage where the buggy function refers to column names incorrectly, causing an incorrect index level lookup.
   
3. The bug arises from the misinterpretation of the column names in the tuple `clocs` while trying to obtain the level numbers using `_get_level_number` method. This leads to a KeyError due to the incorrect lookup.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of multi-index columns using the passed `clocs` tuple.
2. Correct usage of the `_get_level_number` method to obtain the level numbers based on the column names in the multi-index.
3. Update the indexing and selection mechanism to align with the expected behavior during unstacking.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Reconstruct the dummy index based on the groupings
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    # Update the data frame index for further processing
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version resolves the buggy behavior by correctly handling the multi-index columns and obtaining the level numbers appropriately based on the column names provided in `clocs`. This fix aligns the function with the expected behavior and resolves the key error encountered during the unstacking process.
