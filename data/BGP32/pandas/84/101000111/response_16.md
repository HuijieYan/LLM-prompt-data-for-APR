### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` receives data and column locations (`clocs`) as input.
2. The buggy function aims to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on multiple column locations.
3. The issue arises when `_unstack_multiple` is called by the `unstack` function on a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex, causing the KeyError.
4. The `_unstack_multiple` function fails to correctly handle the hierarchical columns during the unstacking process.
5. The error occurs when attempting to retrieve the level numbers from the index based on the column locations provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_unstack_multiple` function does not properly handle the hierarchical columns when unstacking. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to extract the level numbers from the index based on the column locations, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function correctly handles MultiIndex columns during the unstacking process. Specifically, we need to adjust the code related to extracting level numbers from the index based on the provided column locations. Additionally, we should ensure that the function can handle both Series and DataFrames with MultiIndex columns.

### Bug-fixed Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # The remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

This corrected version includes the necessary adjustments to handle the `clocs` parameter properly, especially when it's a tuple representing hierarchical column names. The function should now be able to correctly unstack DataFrame and Series objects with MultiIndex columns without encountering a KeyError.
