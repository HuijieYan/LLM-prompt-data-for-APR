### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling unstacking for multi-level columns in a DataFrame.
2. The function receives data, column locations `clocs`, and an optional `fill_value`.
3. The primary issue arises when converting column locations `clocs` into level numbers, which could result in incorrect behavior.

### Bug location:
The bug seems to be located in the code snippet:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Bug cause:
1. The bug occurs because, in the case where `clocs` is passed as a tuple, the code tries to retrieve the level number corresponding to the tuple instead of the individual elements within the tuple.
2. This behavior leads to a KeyError because the function `index._get_level_number()` doesn't find the tuple `('A', 'a')` directly in level names.

### Fix strategy:
1. We need to ensure that when `clocs` is passed as a tuple, we extract the elements from the tuple and retrieve the level number for each element individually.
2. Handle the conversion of clocs to level numbers appropriately to prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Fixed code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

   # Modify the conversion of clocs to level numbers
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = tuple([index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs])
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
``` 

This corrected version should address the issue by handling tuple `clocs` appropriately and correctly getting the level numbers for unstacking multiple columns in a DataFrame.
