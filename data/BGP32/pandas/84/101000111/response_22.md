### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame based on multiple levels.
2. It extracts and processes various properties from the input DataFrame's index, codes, names, levels, and eventually creates a new DataFrame called `unstacked`.
3. The bug lies in how the index levels are processed and utilized when creating the `dummy_index`. This operation affects the subsequent unstacking and reconstruction of the columns.
4. The input parameters for the `clocs` represent the levels by which the DataFrame needs to be unstacked.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the incorrect treatment of the levels represented by `clocs` in the function `_unstack_multiple`. When extracting the index levels numbers, the code currently attempts to directly use the names as strings for indexing resulting in a KeyError when they should be processed as tuples like the `"__placeholder__"` level.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that index level names are handled correctly by recognizing that they are tuples representing multi-level names.
2. Convert these tuples to actual mapping of levels to be consistent with the rest of the index processing.
3. Adjust the subsequent operations to handle multiple levels accurately during unstacking and column reconstruction.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = [index.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]

    other_loc_levels = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in other_loc_levels]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in other_loc_levels]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in other_loc_levels]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if other_loc_levels == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(cloc_levels)):
                val = cloc_levels[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_levels = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_levels]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By addressing the issue of how the index level names are handled, the function now accurately performs the unstacking operation on a DataFrame with multiple levels. It resolves the KeyError problem observed in the reported GitHub issue when trying to `unstack` based on tuple names.
