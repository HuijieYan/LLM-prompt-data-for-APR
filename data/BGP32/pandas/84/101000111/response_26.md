### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame based on multiple levels and hierarchies.
2. The function attempts to extract information from the input DataFrame's index and then modify it accordingly to create a new structure for unstacking.
3. The issue seems to stem from the handling of MultiIndexes with tuple names (like ('A', 'a')) when trying to get level numbers.
4. The error message and the provided cases highlight discrepancies in handling tuple names which lead to KeyError for specific cases.
   
### Bug Cause:
1. The `clocs` parameter received by the `_unstack_multiple` function may contain tuple names from MultiIndexes, like ('A', 'a'), which are not handled correctly.
2. There is an issue with retrieving the level numbers from tuple names in the index, resulting in a KeyError as observed in the failing cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way tuple names from MultiIndexes are processed to extract level numbers correctly.
2. The function should identify tuple names within the indexes and convert them into the corresponding level numbers for further processing.
3. Proper handling of tuple names is crucial to ensure the unstacking operation proceeds without errors.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle conversion of tuple names to numerical levels
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With the above modification, the function now checks if the element within `clocs` is a tuple name and converts it to the corresponding level number if needed. This adjustment ensures that tuple names from MultiIndexes are processed correctly and addresses the KeyError issue identified in the failing cases.
