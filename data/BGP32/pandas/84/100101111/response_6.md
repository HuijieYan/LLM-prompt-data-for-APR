### Analyze the Buggy Function
The _unstack_multiple function is designed to perform unstacking on a multi-level index DataFrame. The key steps involve processing the input data based on specific column locations and reconstructing the DataFrame with new levels and columns.

### Error Identification
The bug is causing the KeyError 'Level A not found' when attempting to unstack based on a tuple of names. The error originates from the _unstack_multiple function where the column locations are not correctly handled when processing hierarchical column names.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely due to the improper handling of hierarchical indices when constructing the final DataFrame. The function assumes that all columns are non-hierarchical, leading to incorrect indexing operations and eventually causing the KeyError during unstacking.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should differentiate between simple column names and hierarchical column names. Proper indexing and reconstruction of the DataFrame based on the hierarchical structure are essential for a successful unstack operation.

### Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else [index.levels[i]] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else [index.codes[i]] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else [index.levels[i]] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else [index.codes[i]] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # proceed with the remaining function logic for unstacking based on the differentiated column types
```

This updated code snippet correctly identifies hierarchical column names (tuples) and handles them differently than regular column names. This modification should prevent the KeyError issue during unstacking when hierarchical columns are involved.

By making these adjustments, the _unstack_multiple function now properly deals with hierarchical columns, ensuring the unstack operation works correctly as intended.
