### Bug Analysis:

1. The bug occurs when trying to unstack a `DataFrame` that has a MultiIndex with tuple names.
2. The `_unstack_multiple` function fails to handle tuple names in MultiIndex which leads to a Key error.
3. The error arises from extracting level numbers from the names.
4. The cause of the bug is that the code doesn't correctly handle tuple names when extracting level numbers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Modify the way level numbers are extracted based on the names in the MultiIndex to properly deal with tuple names.
2. Ensure that tuple names are correctly identified and handled throughout the unstacking process.
3. Update the extraction of level numbers to properly account for tuple names.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

By making the adjustments as shown above, the function should now be able to correctly handle unstacking when tuple names are present in the MultiIndex, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
