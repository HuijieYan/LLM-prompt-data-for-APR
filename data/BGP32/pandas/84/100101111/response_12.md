## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to handle MultiIndexed data correctly, especially when unstacking based on tuple names like `('A', 'a')`.
2. The function seems to be correctly identifying the levels and codes of the MultiIndex but encounters issues during unstacking when tuple names are involved.
3. The bug is causing a KeyError when trying to find the level numbers for tuple names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tuple names are handled properly when unstacking the MultiIndexed data.

## Solution:
To correct the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function in a way that properly processes tuple names when unstacking MultiIndexed data.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle tuple names correctly for unstacking
    index = data.index
    
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_number = [index._get_level_number(l) for l in loc]
        else:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(clocs)
        level_numbers.extend(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Remaining code follows without any changes
    ...
```

This corrected version of the function should now be able to handle MultiIndexed data with tuple names correctly and resolve the KeyError issue identified in the failing test.
