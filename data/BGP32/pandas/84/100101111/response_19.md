### Bug Analysis

#### Issue:
The bug occurs when trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex and tuple names, specifically when using the `unstack` method with tuple names in the `DataFrame.unstack` function.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the point where the level numbers are being extracted from the `clocs` parameter. The error probably arises from attempting to get the level number of a tuple name in the MultiIndex.

#### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` receives input `clocs` with tuple names like `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`.
2. The function tries to extract the level number for each element in `clocs` by calling `_get_level_number`, but it may fail for tuple names as keys since it expects the keys to be simple strings.
3. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to get the level number for a tuple-based key like `('A', 'a')`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a strategy involving handling tuple-based keys correctly while getting the level number in a MultiIndex is needed. We should identify tuple-based keys and handle them appropriately when extracting level numbers.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the MultiIndex from the data
    index = data.index
    
    rows = [loc if isinstance(loc, str) else loc[0] for loc in clocs]
    cols = [loc if isinstance(loc, str) else loc[1] for loc in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [index.get_loc(row) for row in rows]
    clocs = [index.get_loc(col) for col in cols]

    # Continue with the existing implementation
    ...

    return unstacked
```

By specifically handling tuple-based keys while extracting the row and column locations, we can address the `KeyError` that occurs during unstacking with tuple names in the MultiIndex.
