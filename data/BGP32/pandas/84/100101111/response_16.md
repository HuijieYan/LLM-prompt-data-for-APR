### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex names in the input data. When unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex, the function fails to identify the correct levels and results in a KeyError.

1. In the failing test case, `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` triggers the bug.
2. The bug is due to incorrect handling of levels and names in the MultiIndex data by the function.
3. The function attempts to extract level numbers using the names directly, which fails in the case of tuple names like `('A', 'a')`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the levels and names are processed to correctly identify the level numbers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Parse the level names correctly to extract the level numbers.
2. Use the extracted level numbers to access the appropriate data from the MultiIndex.
3. Ensure that the handling of level names works correctly for all types of names, including tuples.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract level numbers from clocs
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code stays the same

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

By updating the function as described above, the bug related to unstacking MultiIndex with tuple names should be resolved, allowing the function to work correctly with the provided test cases.
