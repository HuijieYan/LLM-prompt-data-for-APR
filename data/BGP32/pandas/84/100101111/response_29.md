### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of multiple levels when unstacking a DataFrame with tuple names in a MultiIndex. The function fails to properly identify and process the levels to unstack, leading to KeyError when attempting to unstack them.

The bug is related to GitHub Issue `MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError`, where unstacking a Series with tuple names in a MultiIndex raises a KeyError due to incorrect level identification.

### Error Locations:
The primary error lies in the identification of levels to unstack based on the input `clocs`. The faulty logic results in misinterpretation of the specified levels for unstacking, leading to incorrect reshaping of the data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect interpretation of the level names provided in `clocs`. The chosen levels are not correctly identified for unstacking, leading to misalignment between the expected and actual target levels.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to correctly interpret the specified levels for unstacking. This involves ensuring that the provided level names are correctly mapped to the actual levels in the data MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers based on the specified level names
    cloc_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    if len(cloc_numbers) == 1:
        # Handle unstacking for a single level
        unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_numbers[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Handle unstacking for multiple levels
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        for i in range(1, len(clocs)):
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(clocs[i], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the levels specified in `clocs` are correctly translated to their level numbers within the index, facilitating the proper unstacking of the DataFrame.

By using the correct level numbers when calling the `unstack` method, the function should now be able to accurately unstack the DataFrame with tuple names in a MultiIndex, resolving the KeyError issue identified in the GitHub report.
