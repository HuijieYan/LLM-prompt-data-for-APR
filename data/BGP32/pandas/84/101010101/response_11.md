### Bug Analysis
The bug arises in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to an issue with the handling of the column level index. The function does not correctly process the tuple input for `clocs` when dealing with MultiIndex column names and causes an error when looking up the level number based on the specified names.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the following line of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Cause of the Bug
The root cause of the bug is that the function expects `clocs` to be a flat list of level names when handling MultiIndex columns. However, in the failing test cases, the `clocs` parameter is provided as a tuple containing the names of multiple levels. This results in a ValueError or KeyError when trying to use those tuple values directly as level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of `clocs` when it is a tuple containing level names. We should first check if the `clocs` parameter is a tuple and flatten it to a regular list of level names before further processing.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function stays the same
    # The rest of the code in the function uses clocs, rlocs, clevels, ccodes, cnames, rlevels, rcodes, rnames
    # as defined in the corrected part above
```

By modifying the function to handle the conversion of a tuple input into a flat list of level names, we ensure that the subsequent operations do not encounter errors related to level name lookup.
