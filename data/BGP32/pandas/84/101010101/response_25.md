### Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `_get_level_number` function when trying to access a level that is not found, resulting in a `KeyError`. This issue seems to stem from the problematic parameter `clocs` in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The `clocs` variable should be either a single value or a tuple of values, but it is causing confusion due to improper handling.

### Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect processing of the `clocs` parameter in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The method incorrectly assumes that `clocs` should be processed as individual values in the list comprehension, which leads to a mismatch when trying to extract the level number.

### Fix
To resolve the bug, `clocs` should be handled according to its expected data type. If it is a tuple, it should be separated into individual values, and if it is a single value, it should be addressed properly without causing confusion.

### Updated Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Correct handling of clocs based on its type
    if not isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (clocs,)
    
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function code...
```

This modification ensures that the `clocs` variable is correctly handled whether it is a single value or a tuple, resolving the bug related to extracting the level number.
