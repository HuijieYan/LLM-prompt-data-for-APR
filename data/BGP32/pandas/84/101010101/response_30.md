## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the use of a tuple `clocs` instead of an individual level name when calling the `_get_level_number` method. This leads to an error when trying to find the level name in the list of names.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure to pass individual level names instead of tuples when calling the `_get_level_number` method. This can be achieved by unpacking the tuple if `clocs` is a tuple before using it.

## The corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert tuple to list
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
``` 

By checking the type of `clocs` as a tuple, converting it into a list, and then using the list for processing individual level names when calling `_get_level_number`, we have addressed the bug. Now the corrected function should be able to handle the provided test cases without any errors.
