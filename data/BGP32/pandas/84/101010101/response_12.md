### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way the `clocs` are handled. The bug occurs when `clocs` are passed as a tuple with multi-level values. The function doesn't properly handle this case, resulting in errors accessing the levels. 

The core issue is that the current implementation of `_unstack_multiple` doesn't support multi-level indexing. The buggy line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` assumes that clocs will always have single-level values. When clocs is a tuple with multi-level values, this approach fails because the function `_get_level_number` cannot handle multi-level values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the approach to handle cases where `clocs` contains multi-level values. We can iterate over the elements of `clocs`, check if any of the values in the tuple are tuples themselves (indicating multi-level values), and adjust the processing accordingly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers from clocs while handling multi-level values
    clocs_single_level = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            clocs_single_level.extend([data.index._get_level_number(level) for level in loc])
        else:
            clocs_single_level.append(data.index._get_level_number(loc))

    clevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in clocs_single_level]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in clocs_single_level]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in clocs_single_level]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_single_level]

    # The remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By iterating through the elements of `clocs`, the corrected implementation can handle both single-level values and multi-level tuples within `clocs`. This modification ensures that the function processes multi-level values correctly, addressing the bug identified in the original implementation.
