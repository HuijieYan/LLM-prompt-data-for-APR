### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the incorrect handling of the input parameter `clocs`, which is expected to be a tuple. In the buggy function, it is wrongly converted to a list and then used to retrieve the level number from the index. This leads to an error when the second element of the tuple is attempted to be retrieved as the level name.

### Cause of the Bug
The key issue lies in the conversion of the tuple `clocs` to a list and then using it to extract level numbers from the index. This causes an error when trying to access the index with a tuple instead of a string (level name).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Instead of converting `clocs` to a list, make sure to use each element directly.
2. Update the retrieval of level numbers by checking if the element in `clocs` is a string (level name) instead of converting it to a list beforehand.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
I've made the necessary adjustments to the buggy function to ensure that it handles the tuple correctly when extracting level numbers. Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By making these changes, the function should now handle the input parameter `clocs` correctly and avoid the error raised due to incorrect handling of tuples and lists.
