### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of column level names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When a MultiIndex contains tuple names, the function fails to correctly identify the level numbers, leading to a KeyError during unstacking. This issue is reflected in the failing test functions which aim to unstack MultiIndexed DataFrames with tuple names. The bug arises when extracting level numbers from the column locations (`clocs`).

### Bug Location:
The bug is present in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The issue arises when attempting to extract level numbers by iterating over the column locations tuple without handling the tuple names properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes a KeyError because the function `_get_level_number` is unable to handle tuple names when fetching level numbers. As a result, it fails to find a level corresponding to the tuple name, leading to a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the way level numbers are extracted from column locations to handle tuple names correctly. The fix involves identifying tuple names and extracting the level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

### Proposed Fix Explanation:
The corrected version of the function uses a conditional check to differentiate between single level loc values and tuple names in column locations (`clocs`). If the value in `clocs` is a tuple, `index.get_loc(i)` is used to get the level number. This modification allows for proper handling of tuple names and resolves the KeyError issue during unstacking.
