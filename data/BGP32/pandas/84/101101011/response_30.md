### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the `level` parameter when unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex that has tuple names. The function tries to retrieve the level numbers based on the provided tuple names, but due to an incorrect implementation, it fails to find the corresponding levels in the MultiIndex.

The issue originates from the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The `index._get_level_number(i)` call tries to get the level number based on the tuple names provided in `clocs`, but when the tuple names are encountered, a `KeyError` is raised as it expects integer levels rather than tuples.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case where tuple names are provided as level identifiers. This can be achieved by modifying how the levels are extracted from the index and comparing them with the tuple names to retrieve the correct level numbers.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Fix the issue with tuple names as level identifiers
    index = data.index
    if all(isinstance(level, tuple) for level in clocs):
        clocs = [index.names.index(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By incorporating the above fix, the function should now be able to correctly extract the level numbers based on tuple names when dealing with MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

### Expected Outcome
After applying the fix and running the failing test case `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex`, the corrected function should successfully unstack the DataFrame with tuple names in the MultiIndex, resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
