### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns using a tuple as the level name. The issue arises from the conversion of tuple level names to their corresponding level numbers in the MultiIndex columns. The error is due to the `_get_level_number` method not handling tuple key names correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function related to the retrieval of the level numbers based on tuple names to address the KeyError issue experienced when unstacking MultiIndex columns. Instead of expecting only a single level name, we need to handle the case where tuple names are passed as level indicators.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing the bug and understanding its root cause, here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the levels and codes from the MultiIndex
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
    ...
```

By modifying the handling of the `clocs` parameter to correctly identify and get the level numbers based on tuple names when provided, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests related to unstacking MultiIndex columns using tuple names.
