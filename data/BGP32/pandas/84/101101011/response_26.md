### Issue Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the handling of multi-level index columns during unstacking. The function attempts to unstack the data based on the provided column levels, but the index levels are not correctly handled. This leads to KeyError during unstacking.

### Bug Identification:
The bug arises when extracting level numbers from column locations (`clocs`) and dealing with multi-level index columns (hierarchical columns). The function does not consider the hierarchical column structure correctly, leading to errors.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises due to the presence of multi-level index columns in the DataFrame. When trying to unstack on specific column levels, the function fails to appropriately determine the level numbers corresponding to the column tuples such as `('A', 'a')`. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when attempting to unstack the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles multi-level index columns when extracting level numbers from column locations (`clocs`). This involves updating the logic to properly identify the indices corresponding to the provided column tuples.

### Corrected Function:

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Update the clocs to handle multi-level index columns
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version properly handles multi-level index columns when extracting level numbers from column locations. The function should now be able to handle the provided column tuples and unstack the data without KeyError errors.
