### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from an issue in the `_get_level_number` method inside Pandas' `MultiIndex` class. The `_get_level_number` method is supposed to return the index of a specified level in the MultiIndex object. However, due to an incorrect implementation or handling of Tuple names in MultiIndex objects, the method is unable to find the specified level causing a KeyError.

Essentially, when attempting to unstack a DataFrame containing a MultiIndex with Tuple names, the method `_get_level_number` fails to retrieve the index of the specified level ('A' in the GitHub issue's case). This failure subsequently leads to the KeyError, causing the unstack operation to fail. The bug manifests in the `_unstack_multiple` function when it attempts to retrieve the level numbers of the specified clocs (columns) using the `_get_level_number` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle Tuple names in MultiIndex objects and address the issue with retrieving the level numbers. We'll need to ensure that the clocs (columns) containing Tuple names are correctly processed to avoid triggering the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Based on the analysis and bug explanation, we need to adjust the code in the `_unstack_multiple` function to address the issue. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # No change in the code from here until the bug is resolved
    index = data.index

    # Correct the code to handle Tuple names in MultiIndex
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else index.names.index(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By updating how clocs are handled and processed, this corrected version of the function should now properly handle Tuple names in MultiIndex objects and successfully unstack the DataFrame without triggering the KeyError.
