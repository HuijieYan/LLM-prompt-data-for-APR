### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `unstack` operation on a DataFrame with a MultiIndex that has tuple names fails due to a Key Error. This error is raised in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to retrieve the level number of a tuple name in the MultiIndex.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` assumes that the `clocs` parameter is a list of level names of the MultiIndex. However, when the column names are tuples in the MultiIndex, the function incorrectly processes the tuple names, leading to the KeyError during the unstack operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle tuple names correctly when extracting the level numbers from the MultiIndex. We should update the logic to handle both single level names and tuple names in the MultiIndex columns. This will ensure that the correct level numbers are used throughout the unstack operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle both single level names and tuple names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function can correctly process both single level names and tuple names in the MultiIndex columns, ensuring a successful unstack operation.
