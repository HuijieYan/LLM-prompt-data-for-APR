### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels of MultiIndex where the level names are provided as a tuple. The issue arises when trying to extract the level numbers corresponding to the provided level names. The function incorrectly assumes that the provided level names are single strings, leading to a failure in identifying the correct level numbers in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the code snippet responsible for extracting the level numbers based on the level names. Rather than directly trying to match the level names as strings, we should iterate over each level name in the tuple and extract the corresponding level number for each.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

After applying this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle tuple names in MultiIndex levels and successfully unstack the DataFrame based on the provided level names.
