### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when dealing with multi-level column indices in a DataFrame. The issue arises due to the use of the column names tuple `clocs` directly without converting them to level numbers. As a result, when trying to get the level number of a tuple name, it raises a KeyError since the tuple name does not exist in the list of level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the column names tuple `clocs` should be converted to level numbers before further processing in the `_unstack_multiple` function. This will ensure that the function can handle multi-level column indices correctly.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert column names tuple to level numbers
    clocs = [data.columns._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By converting the `clocs` tuple to level numbers before proceeding, the function will correctly handle multi-level column indices and resolve the KeyError issue.
