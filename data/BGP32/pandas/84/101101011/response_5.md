### Analysis:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking in dataframes with MultiIndex.
2. The bug occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where the function `_get_level_number` is called with values that are tuples representing MultiIndex levels, causing the KeyError as it expects levels to be strings.
3. The failing test `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` triggered the bug by trying to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame using a tuple as the level specification.
4. The issue on GitHub reports a similar problem, indicating that unstacking fails when tuple names are used.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the code to handle the case where the `level` parameter in `clocs` is a tuple by converting it to a string before calling `_get_level_number`.
2. Ensure that the code can handle both single-level indexes and MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

Applying this change will allow the function to correctly handle unstack operations with tuple names in MultiIndex DataFrames and address the KeyError during level extraction.
