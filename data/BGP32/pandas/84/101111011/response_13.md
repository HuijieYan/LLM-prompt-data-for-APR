### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function within the `pandas.MultiIndex` class. When trying to find the number associated with the given level name, the code mistakenly checks for the exact string value of the level name. Instead, it should check for the name tuple.

The failing tests provide multiple examples where the level name is actually a tuple, such as `('A', 'a')`. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to find the level number since the code only expects a single string name.

### Fix Strategy

1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function within `pandas.MultiIndex` to handle the case where the level name is a tuple.
2. Adapt the `_unstack_multiple` function to use the correct behavior of `_get_level_number` in case of tuple names.

### Corrected Version

```python
# Corrected _get_level_number function
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        level_name = tuple(level)
    else:
        level_name = level

    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level_name):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level_name} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    
    try:
        level_num = self.names.index(level_name)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level_name} not found")
    
    return level_num

# Corrected _unstack_multiple function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    ...
    # The rest of the function remains the same

```

Applying this change should fix the issue and make the function work correctly with tuple level names.
