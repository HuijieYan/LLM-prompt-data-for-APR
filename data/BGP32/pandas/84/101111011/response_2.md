### Explanation:
The `buggy function` is failing because it tries to access the level number of a MultiIndex by passing the level name as a tuple. This happens in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
When `clocs` is passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` to `_get_level_number`, it raises a `ValueError` due to the invalid format of the level name.

### Solution:
- We need to modify the way the level name is passed to `_get_level_number` to avoid the error.
- `Tuple` should be converted to a `list` if it is a tuple of tuples i.e., a multi-level name. Then, it should be passed to `_get_level_number` for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_flat = [loc for t in clocs for loc in t]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else list(i) for i in clocs_flat]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This correction ensures proper handling of the level names by `_get_level_number` based on whether the name is a single level or a multi-level name and successfully resolves the issue.
