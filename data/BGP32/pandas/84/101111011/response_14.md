### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the way the `clocs` parameter is processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function attempts to get the level number for each element in `clocs` which is provided as a tuple in the failing test. However, it expects the names in `clocs` to already correspond to level names, but the names are not being processed correctly leading to errors, specifically when tuple names are involved.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function tries to get the level number for each element in `clocs` by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`. 
2. The `clocs` provided in the failing test is a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which the function does not handle correctly.
3. The error occurs when trying to find the index of `'A'` in the level names which are tuples like `(('A', 'a'), ('B', 'b'))`, hence leading to a `ValueError`.
4. Subsequently, a `KeyError` is raised "Level A not found".

### Proposed Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the level names are processed. The function should handle both simple strings for level names and tuples gracefully. Specifically:
1. Check if the element in `clocs` is a string or a tuple.
2. If it's a tuple, convert it to a string representation.
3. Then find the level number based on this converted string.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]  # Convert tuple elements to string

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

Applying this modification should ensure that the function can handle tuple names correctly and pass the failing test cases.
