### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the column location (`clocs`) in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Specifically, the issue arises when dealing with MultiIndex columns where tuple names are involved.

In the failing tests, the `clocs` parameter is being passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, implying the desire to unstack columns based on these two levels of MultiIndex.

The buggy function attempts to retrieve the level numbers related to the column locations, but it fails when it encounters a tuple name like ('A', 'a') in the `MultiIndex` object. This failure leads to the KeyErrors and ValueErrors seen in the test outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for extracting level numbers from the MultiIndex columns to correctly handle tuple names.
2. Modify the function to understand Tuple names within the MultiIndex and extract the corresponding level numbers accordingly.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data

        for loc in clocs:
            # Get the level number for tuple names
            loc = result.columns.get_loc(loc) if isinstance(loc, tuple) else loc

            result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)

        return result

    # Handle regular columns
    index = data.index

    # Get the level number for each column location
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same
    ...
```

By utilizing the `get_loc` method for MultiIndex column names when encountering tuple names, the corrected function can correctly identify the level numbers associated with those names. This adjustment should resolve the KeyErrors and ValueErrors experienced during unstacking operations involving MultiIndex columns with tuple names.
