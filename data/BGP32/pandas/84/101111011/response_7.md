### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails due to an error in handling the levels of the MultiIndex object. The error occurs when the function tries to convert the level names into level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex object. This leads to a KeyError because it cannot find the level name in the list of names belonging to the MultiIndex.

### Bug Cause
The function assumes the level names are strings, but in the failing tests, the level names are tuples. This discrepancy causes the function to fail when attempting to convert the tuple name into a level number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to modify the way we handle level names in the MultiIndex object. We should account for both strings and tuples as level names and ensure the conversion from name to number is handled correctly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining implementation follows without modification
    ...
```

With this modification, the function will handle both string and tuple level names correctly, and the issue should be resolved.
