### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to an issue in the `_get_level_number` function within the `MultiIndex` class. The error arises when trying to unstack a multi-index dataframe with tuple names using the 'unstack' method. Specifically, the error is due to a KeyError raised within the `_get_level_number` function that fails to identify the position of the given level within the index names.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `_unstack_multiple` function uses the `_get_level_number` method, which is intended to retrieve the level number within the MultiIndex structure. 
- However, the error occurs when trying to extract the level number for a tuple name like `('A', 'a')`.
- The function raises a ValueError stating that the level name is not found, followed by a KeyError when handling the exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_level_number` method works correctly for tuple names in the MultiIndex. The fix involves handling tuple names in the `_get_level_number` method more effectively. We can modify the method to support tuple names as well as single names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with modifications to address the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case of tuple names by checking the type of the level name and adjusting the level number extraction mechanism accordingly.

This fix should resolve the issue and allow unstacking of MultiIndex dataframes with tuple names successfully.
