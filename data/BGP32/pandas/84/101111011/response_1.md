### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `_unstack_multiple` function tries to get the level number of a multi-level index column on line 320, specifically trying to get the level number based on the passed tuples ('A', 'a') and 'B'. However, the current implementation does not handle the case of tuples representing index levels properly.

The error arises due to the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line, where it expects each `i` in `clocs` to be a single value, not a tuple as in the failing tests. This incompatibility with tuple values causes the code to throw a ValueError and a KeyError during index level number retrieval.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `clocs` contains tuples representing MultiIndex levels, the function processes them correctly. We should modify the `_get_level_number` implementation to handle tuple level specifications properly so that the `clocs` can be processed correctly.

### Corrected Implementation

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected implementation ensures that if `clocs` contains tuples, it uses `index.get_loc(i)` to retrieve the corresponding level location within the MultiIndex, which aligns with the expected behavior of handling MultiIndex level tuples. This modification should resolve the issue and allow the function to process MultiIndex columns correctly using tuple level specifications.
