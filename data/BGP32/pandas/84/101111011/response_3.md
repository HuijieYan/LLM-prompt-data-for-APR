### Bug Explanation:
The main issue arises from the usage of `tuple` type objects as level names in `unstack`, which causes the `_get_level_number` method to attempt to find `tuple`s in the list of level names. This mismatch leads to a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`, ultimately causing the test cases to fail.

In the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the problematic lines occur when it tries to extract the level number for each element in `clocs`. The error results from the attempt to find a `tuple` element in the list of level names, which is expected to contain strings.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle cases where level names are passed as `tuple`s correctly. The correction should involve a check to distinguish between names and level numbers to avoid breaking the process. Additionally, the function should handle both simple and multi-level indices properly.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):   
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index object
    index = data.index

    # Check if the clocs are tuples and get the level numbers correctly
    clocs_level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc = (index.names.index(loc[0]), loc[1])  # Convert tuple to level number
        clocs_level_numbers.append(loc)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [loc[0] for loc in clocs_level_numbers]]

    clevels = [index.levels[loc[0]] for loc in clocs_level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[loc[0]] for loc in clocs_level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[loc[0]] for loc in clocs_level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle both simple and multi-level indices, and correctly process level names passed as tuples, ensuring that the `KeyError` issue is resolved.
