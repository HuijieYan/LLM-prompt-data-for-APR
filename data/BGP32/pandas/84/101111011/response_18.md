### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function because the code tries to access the level number of a MultiIndex using hierarchical names but fails to handle this scenario correctly. The function expects the input `clocs` to be the levels for which to perform the unstack operation. However, with a tuple of names like `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, the code tries to extract the level numbers using the names directly, which leads to the error. The error message `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` or `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` is raised when trying to retrieve the level number for names that do not match indices in the level names list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the code should handle the scenario where the input `clocs` is a tuple of column names by modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly extract the level numbers. The function should iterate over the tuple of names and find their corresponding level numbers in the MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue described above:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code for unstacking

```

By iterating over the tuple of names and using `index.get_loc(name)` to retrieve the level numbers along with other necessary modifications, the function should now be able to handle the unstacking operation with multi-level column names correctly.
