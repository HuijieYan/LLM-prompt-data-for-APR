### Bug Analysis:
The main issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the handling of multi-level index names. The function attempts to extract the level number of columns based on the names provided in the `clocs` variable. However, the `MultiIndex` columns have tuples as names, which causes a problem when trying to get the level number.

The error occurs when the function tries to use `index._get_level_number(i)` to extract the level number from the provided column name tuple. This results in an error because the function expects a single name for the level, not a tuple.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function handles the extraction of level numbers from the column names in the `clocs` variable. Since it's dealing with multi-level columns, the function should check if the name is a tuple and handle it accordingly.

### Updated Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level_name):
        if isinstance(level_name, tuple):
            for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
                if name == level_name:
                    return i
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level_name} not found")
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(level_name)

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The updated function includes a new helper function `get_level_number()` that checks if the provided level name is a tuple. If the name is a tuple, it iterates through the list of names in the `MultiIndex` columns to find the matching tuple. If a match is found, it returns the index of that level. Otherwise, it raises a `KeyError`. If the name is not a tuple, the function proceeds to get the level number using the original method.

With this change, the function will be able to correctly handle multi-level column names and extract the level numbers required for further processing. This should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
