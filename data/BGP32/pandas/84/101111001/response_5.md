### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to get the level number of a multiindex using a tuple of names as the input. This causes an error because the function `_get_level_number` expects a single name as input, not a tuple.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we handle input parameter `clocs`, converting it into a single name instead of a tuple. This change will help in extracting the correct level numbers from the index.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple of names into a single name
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

By updating the function to handle `clocs` properly, the provided failing tests should now pass.
