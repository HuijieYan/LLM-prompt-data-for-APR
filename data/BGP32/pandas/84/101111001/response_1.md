### Issue:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function when it tries to find the level number for a multiindex that contains tuple names. The current implementation assumes that all level names are single strings, not tuples, resulting in errors.

### Explanation:
1. In the failing test, the `unstack_idx` tuple is `(("A", "a"), "B")`, which is passed to the `data.unstack(unstack_idx)` call.
2. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to extract level numbers corresponding to the given names from the `data.index`.
3. The `Index._get_level_number` function expects a single string as the `level` parameter instead of a tuple, leading to the error.

### Solution:
Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multiindex names that are tuples by unpacking the tuple to individual level names before calling `_get_level_number`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract individual level names from tuples if present
    clocs = [i if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i[0] for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function code remains the same...
```

Applying the above fix should resolve the issue and allow the function to correctly extract level numbers even for multiindex names that are tuples.
