### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to retrieve the level number of a multi-index name that is in the form of tuples. The `_get_level_number` function expects a level as a string, but when the multi-index name is represented as a tuple, it raises an error because it cannot find the tuple in the list of names.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is that the function `_get_level_number` expects a single level name as a string, but when a multi-index name is provided in tuple format, it cannot handle it properly and raises an error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle multi-index names provided as tuples. We can detect if the level is a tuple and then convert it to a string so that it matches the type expected by the `_get_level_number` function.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, str) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- In the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, str) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]`, we check if the provided level is not a string (indicating it's a tuple) and then proceed to find the index of that name in the list of names.
- This approach allows us to handle both single string levels and tuple levels correctly, ensuring that the `_get_level_number` function works as expected.

By applying this fix, the function should now be able to handle multi-index names provided in tuple format, resolving the errors encountered in the failing tests.
