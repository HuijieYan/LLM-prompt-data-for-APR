### Bug Understanding
The bug is caused by the use of a tuple `('A', 'a')` as an input to the `_get_level_number(i)` method which expects a single string as input. The method tries to find the index of the input level within the list of level names. Since the input is a tuple, it fails with a `ValueError`. This issue prevents the correct unstacking of the DataFrame, leading to the failing tests.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the input in the `_unstack_multiple` function. We should check if the input is a tuple and convert it to a single string before passing it to the `_get_level_number` method.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with the input tuple converted to a string when passing it to the `_get_level_number` method:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
```

By converting the tuple input to a string when calling the `_get_level_number` method, we ensure that the method receives a single string as expected, fixing the bug.
