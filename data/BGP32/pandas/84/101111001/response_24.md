### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to an issue with the `clocs` input parameter, which is a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`. The buggy function expects `clocs` to be a list of index level names but does not handle tuples properly, leading to an error because it tries to find a tuple in the index names.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuples correctly. We should check if an element in `clocs` is a tuple and handle it accordingly to extract the individual level names. Then, we can continue with the rest of the unstacking process.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract individual level names from tuple if present
    cloc_indices = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_indices.extend([data.index._get_level_number(level) for level in cloc])
        else:
            cloc_indices.append(data.index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
  
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By implementing this change, the function will correctly handle tuples in the `clocs` input, extracting the individual level names from the tuple before proceeding with the unstacking operation. This modification should address the bug and ensure that the function can handle mixed-type index names effectively.
