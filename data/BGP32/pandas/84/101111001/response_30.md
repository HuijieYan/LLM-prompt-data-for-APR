### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to extract the level number from the column names `'A'` and `'a'`, which are passed as a tuple (`('A', 'a')`). The function `_get_level_number` expects a string as input (`level`), and when it encounters a tuple, it raises an error.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` receives column locations (`clocs`) which include tuple values like `('A', 'a')`.
2. Inside the function, it attempts to get the level number by calling `_get_level_number(i)` for each `i` in `clocs`.
3. The `_get_level_number` function fails when the input `level` is a tuple, leading to a `ValueError` or `KeyError` because it expects a string.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `level` passed to `_get_level_number` is a string, as expected by the function. We can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `level` is a tuple, converting it into a string before calling `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]  # Ensure level is a string

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this modification, the function will correctly handle tuples passed as column locations (`clocs`), converting them to strings before calling `_get_level_number`, and prevent the `ValueError` or `KeyError` from arising during execution.
