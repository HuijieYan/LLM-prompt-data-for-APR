## Bug Analysis

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function originates from the way the `clocs` parameter, representing the columns to be unstacked, is handled. The issue is with the conversion of `clocs` to corresponding level numbers within the index. The approach taken to transform the column locations into levels is not handling multi-level columns appropriately.

### Case 1:
1. The `clocs` parameter is passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, indicating that columns with a hierarchical structure should be unstacked based on the levels 'A' and 'a'.
2. In the buggy function, the `clocs` parameter is converted directly into level numbers. However, it fails to correctly convert the hierarchical columns.
3. This incorrect conversion results in an improper index setup leading to the failure of the unstacking process and comparison with the expected output.

### Case 2:
1. Similar to Case 1, the `clocs` parameter is set to `('A', 'a')`.
2. The issue gravitates around the same problem of level number conversion for hierarchical columns, leading to an incorrect multi-level index creation.
3. The misaligned levels cause the resulting unstacked DataFrame to differ from the expected output, causing the test failure.

### Case 3:
1. Here, the `clocs` parameter is passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` again.
2. The problem persists in how the hierarchical column labels are processed and mapped to levels within the index structure.
3. This inconsistency in establishing the correct levels based on the provided column structure leads to an incorrect output DataFrame.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To rectify the bug, the function needs to accurately translate the hierarchical column information present in `clocs` into corresponding levels within the index. This transformation should account for multiple levels in columns and correctly set up the index levels for unstacking.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the DataFrame
    index = data.index

    # Convert hierarchical clocs to level numbers
    levels = [index._get_level_number(c[0]) for c in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[l] for l in levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[l] for l in levels]
    cnames = [index.names[l] for l in levels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in levels]

    # Handle multi-level columns appropriately
    if len(levels) > 1:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(list(zip(*clocs)), names=cnames)
    else:
        dummy_index = Index(ccodes[0], name='__placeholder__')

    # Create a new DataFrame with proper index and unstacked columns
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(level=-1, fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[0]] + clevels
    new_names = [None] + cnames
    new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]]
    for code in ccodes:
        new_codes.append(code.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This correction properly handles multi-level columns and ensures the unstacking of hierarchical columns occurs as intended. The new implementation should now align with the expected behavior and output for the failing test cases.
