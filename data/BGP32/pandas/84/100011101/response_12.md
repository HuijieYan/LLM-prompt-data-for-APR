### Bug Analysis
The error messages indicate that the function `_get_level_number` encounters errors due to mismatched name formats. The function expects a single level name (string), but in the failing tests, the level names are tuples. This leads to errors like `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` or `KeyError: 'Level A not found`.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing tests, the `clocs` parameter includes tuples like `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which should not be directly used as input for the `_get_level_number` function.
2. The bug arises from the usage of tuples instead of single level names, causing the function to try finding tuples in the list of level names, leading to errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle tuples as compound level names correctly. We should extract single level names from the tuples before processing them further. The modification should allow the function to handle single level names and tuples as level name inputs.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = []
    for col in clocs:
        if isinstance(col, tuple):
            for c in col:
                cloc_levels.append(index._get_level_number(c))
        else:
            cloc_levels.append(index._get_level_number(col))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
``` 

This updated corrected function modifies how the `clocs` parameter is processed to handle both single level names and tuples as compound level names appropriately, avoiding the errors encountered during the failing tests.
