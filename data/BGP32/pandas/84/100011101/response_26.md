### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple due to a mismatch in how the `clocs` variable is processed. The function expects `clocs` to be a list but does not handle tuples correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes `clocs` to be a list and later treats it as a list in the function logic. When `clocs` is passed as a tuple, the function fails to process it correctly, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way `clocs` is handled to account for cases where `clocs` can be a tuple. We should convert it to a list before continuing with further processing.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to a list if it's a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function code follows...
``` 

By converting `clocs` to a list if it's a tuple before processing it further, the corrected function will be able to handle both cases correctly.
