The issue in the provided function lies in the conversion of the column locations to level numbers. The `clocs` parameter is initially passed as a tuple of strings representing column names. However, the function expects these to be converted to level numbers corresponding to the index levels. This conversion is problematic as the column names might contain multiple levels.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle multi-level column names correctly. In this case, we need to check if the column name is present in the `names` rather than directly looking for the index. Additionally, we will need to update the `clocs` conversion part to use the modified method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    def _get_level_number(index, level):
        names = index.names
        if isinstance(level, tuple):  # Handle multi-level column names
            for i, name in enumerate(names):
                if name == level:
                    return i
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        else:
            count = names.count(level)
            if count > 1 and not isinstance(level, int):
                raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
            try:
                return names.index(level)
            except ValueError:
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function stays the same

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

By making the necessary changes in the `_get_level_number` method and updating the usage of it in `_unstack_multiple`, the function should now correctly handle multi-level column names during unstacking operations.
