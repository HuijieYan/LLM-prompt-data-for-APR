## Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function, where the function tries to get the index of a level name, but fails with a KeyError or ValueError. This error happens because the level name was incorrectly passed as a tuple instead of a string.

### Bug Explanation:
When the function `_unstack_multiple` is called with `clocs` parameter as a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, the function tries to extract the level numbers with `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. Due to the incorrect format of `clocs`, the `_get_level_number` function fails to handle it properly and raises an error.

### Strategy to Fix:
In this case, we need to ensure that the `clocs` tuple is unpacked correctly before being passed to `_unstack_multiple`. The problematic line causing the error can be avoided by adjusting the handling of `clocs` to unpack the tuple properly.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Unpack the clocs tuple if it's in a wrong format
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (clocs,)
        
    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    ...
```

By unpacking the `clocs` tuple if it's in the wrong format before passing it to the `_unstack_multiple` function, we ensure that the function will handle the level numbers correctly, resolving the error.
