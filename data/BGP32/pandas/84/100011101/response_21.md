### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to get the level number for a multi-level index using a tuple as the level parameter. When the level tuple is used in the `MultiIndex.names.index(level)` call, it tries to find the tuple itself in the names list of the MultiIndex object, resulting in the error messages `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` and `ValueError: 'A' is not in the list`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the level passed in `clocs` is a tuple representing multiple levels in the MultiIndex. The function should correctly extract the individual levels and find their positions in the names of the MultiIndex.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correctly handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs[0], Iterable):
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
    # (No changes beyond the clocs calculation)
```

By making the modification to correctly handle the input level parameter, the corrected function will behave as expected and resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues encountered in the failing tests.
