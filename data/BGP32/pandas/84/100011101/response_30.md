### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_level_number` is trying to determine the index number of a level within a MultiIndex based on the level name. The error arises because the level name passed (`'A'`) is a tuple instead of a string, causing the exception. This error affects the subsequent operation of the function and results in incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method to check if the input `level` is a tuple and extract the correct string name from it.
2. Update the function call within `_unstack_multiple` to handle the correct level name format passed to `_get_level_number`.
3. Ensure that the rest of the function's logic is unaffected by this change.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = level[0]  # Extract the correct level name from tuple
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    return level

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Adjust the tuple handling for clocs
    clocs = [i[0] if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

Applying this fix will address the tuple handling issue in the `_get_level_number` method and ensure that the function operates correctly.
