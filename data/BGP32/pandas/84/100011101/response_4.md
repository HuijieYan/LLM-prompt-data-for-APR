The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way it handles the `clocs` parameter, which represents the columns to unstack when reshaping the DataFrame. The function incorrectly converts the `clocs` tuple to a list of numerical levels by calling `_get_level_number` on the index, which leads to an error when the level is not found.

The root cause of the bug is that the `clocs` parameter should directly represent the columns passed as tuples, and there is no need to extract level numbers from the index. Instead, the function should handle the column tuples directly during the unstacking process.

To fix the bug, adjust the handling of `clocs` inside the function so that it correctly processes the column tuples without converting them to level numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract clocs to work with column names directly
    cnames = [c if isinstance(c, tuple) else (c,) for c in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function handles the column names directly and correctly performs the unstacking operation for the given columns. This updated version should resolve the error and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
