### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking operations on MultiIndex data.
2. The error messages indicate that there are issues with level names not found.
3. The function is incorrectly handling the `clocs` parameter by treating it as a tuple of level names when it should be a single level name or level number.
4. The error arises when trying to convert the level names to level numbers, causing a `ValueError` to be raised due to the incorrect type of input.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of `clocs` and make sure it represents the correct level number or name.

### Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Adjust handling for level names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining implementation remains the same
```

By making this adjustment to handle the `clocs` parameter correctly, the function should now be able to proceed without raising errors related to level names not being found.
