The buggy function is failing due to an error in indexing while trying to get the level number. The error arises from trying to find a tuple 'A' in the list of names which is incorrect.

Here is a strategy to resolve the bug:
- Update the index._get_level_number method to handle tuples as input correctly.
- Split the input tuples to retrieve the individual levels properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code and logic unchanged from here
```

Make sure to include this correction at the appropriate location in the existing function. After applying this fix, the function should be able to handle tuple inputs, in this case, ('A', 'a'). This should pass all the failing test cases, ensuring that the function behaves as expected.
