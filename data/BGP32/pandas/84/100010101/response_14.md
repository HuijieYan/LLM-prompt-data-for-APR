The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of multi-level column names in the DataFrame. The function is not able to properly identify the level number of a multi-level column name, leading to KeyError or ValueError exceptions.

The immediate cause of the bug is in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
where `clocs` is a tuple containing multi-level column information. The function `_get_level_number` in the MultiIndex class expects a single level name, not a tuple of levels.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the way we handle the column location information. Rather than using `_get_level_number` directly, we can compare the column names in the MultiIndex to find the correct level number for each name in the tuple.

Let's correct the function based on the explanation above:

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Get the levels of the MultiIndex
    levels = [col[0] if isinstance(col, tuple) else col for col in index.names]

    # Find the level number of each column name in clocs
    cloc_numbers = [levels.index(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Remaining code stays the same

```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly handle multi-level column names and perform the unstacking operation without raising errors.
