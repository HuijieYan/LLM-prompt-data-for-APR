The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the fact that the `clocs` parameter is assumed to be a list of level numbers when it is actually a tuple of level names in the failing test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function attempts to convert the names in `clocs` to level numbers by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`, which fails because the level names are specified as tuples.
2. This results in the error messages due to `ValueError` or `KeyError` being raised when trying to access the index that does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the handling of `clocs` to correctly handle the tuple of level names provided.
2. Update the code to correctly determine the levels based on the provided level names for both single and multi-level indices.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple of level names
        clocs = [index.get_loc(name) for name in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining code remains the same ...

    return unstacked
```

By carefully handling the tuple of level names and adjusting the code logic accordingly, the corrected function should now properly handle both single and multi-level indices provided as input.
