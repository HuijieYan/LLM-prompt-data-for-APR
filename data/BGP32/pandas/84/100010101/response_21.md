The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the fact that the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of strings or tuples, instead of being a list of integers representing level numbers. This causes an error when trying to get the level number from the index, as the `clocs` list should have integers to match the level numbers in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the `clocs` parameter to a list of integers representing the level numbers. This can be done by iterating over the elements of `clocs` and getting the level number using `index._get_level_number()` for each element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

This correction ensures that the `clocs` list is correctly converted to a list of integers before further processing in the function. This change allows the function to handle the MultiIndex properly and avoids the errors encountered due to incorrect level information.

After making this change, the function should work correctly for the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
