### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` encounters an error when trying to get the level number from the index using the provided `clocs`.
2. The error arises because `clocs` should be a list of tuples specifying the levels to be unstacked, but it is treated as a single tuple.
3. The function then tries to get the level number for the tuple `'A'`, which is not present in the list of names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the input handling for `clocs` to correctly interpret the levels to be unstacked as a list of tuples.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By correcting the handling of `clocs` as a list of tuples, we avoid the error where the function erroneously tries to retrieve the level number for a single element tuple. The corrected function should now successfully unstack the levels as intended.
