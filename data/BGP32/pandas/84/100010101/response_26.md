### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method where it is trying to find the index of a level that is passed as a tuple instead of just a string. This is causing errors related to the `KeyError` and `ValueError`.

### Bug
The bug is due to the fact that the function is not handling multi-level column names properly. When the column names are passed as a tuple, the function assumes a single level column name, leading to errors and incorrect index values.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle multi-level column names. We should check if the column names are passed as a tuple and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.get_level_values(name) for name in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.get_level_codes(name) for name in clocs]
    cnames = [name for name in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(name) for name in index.names if name not in clocs]
    rcodes = [index.get_level_codes(name) for name in index.names if name not in clocs]
    rnames = [name for name in index.names if name not in clocs]

    # Logic for extracting shape and group_index remains the same

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Logic for handling Series remains the same
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            # Logic for handling MultiIndex columns remains the same
        else:
            # Logic for handling regular Index columns remains the same
        
        # Logic for creating new_columns and updating unstacked remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This modified version of the function should properly handle multi-level column names and prevent the KeyError and ValueError errors that were occurring.
