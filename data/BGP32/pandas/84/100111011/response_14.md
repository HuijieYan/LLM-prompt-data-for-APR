### Bug Explanation

The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` method doesn't handle tuple names in MultiIndex properly. This leads to a `ValueError` `'A' is not in list` followed by a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to address the issue in the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class to correctly handle tuple names. Specifically, we need to modify how tuple names are processed within the `_get_level_number` method.

### Updated Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if count == 1 or not isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = self.names.index(level)
    else:
        for i, name in enumerate(self.names):
            if isinstance(name, tuple) and name == level:
                level = i
                break
         else:
            raise KeyError(f'Level {level} not found')
    return level


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains as-is
```

By implementing this change, we ensure that tuple names are properly handled in the `_get_level_number` method, resolving the `KeyError` issue.

After making this adjustment, re-run the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been successfully fixed.
