### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class. The method checks the input level against the list of level names in the MultiIndex to determine the level number. However, the input level is a tuple (`("A", "a")`) in this case, causing the ValueError.

The function attempts to get the level number for each input level in `clocs`, which contain tuples as element(s). The error occurs when the `_get_level_number` method is called on a tuple, which doesn't match the expected parameter type of a single level name.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be updated to handle cases where the input for `clocs` is a tuple of level names. The function should extract the strings in the tuple, get the corresponding level numbers, and then proceed with the unstacking process.

### Updated `_unstack_multiple` Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level names from tuple if input is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        levels = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        levels = [data.index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    # Rest of the function follows with the levels extracted
    ...
``` 

By incorporating the above fix, the function will be able to handle the input tuple correctly, extract the level names, obtain the corresponding level numbers, and proceed with unstacking the data with the correct levels.
