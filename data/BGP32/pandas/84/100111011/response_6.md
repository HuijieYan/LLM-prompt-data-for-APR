### Error Analysis
- The `_get_level_number` function within the `MultiIndex` class is raising either a `ValueError` or a `KeyError`.
- The issue is caused by passing a tuple for `clocs`, which corresponds to column locations, but the current implementation does not handle hierarchical columns correctly.
- The handling of hierarchical columns is missing in the code.
- The current code logic is checking for the length of `clocs` to be zero but does not handle hierarchical columns properly, leading to the KeyError or ValueError.

### Fixing Strategy
- The fix should involve detecting whether the columns are multi-leveled before proceeding with the unstack operation.
- When columns are multi-leveled, the unstack operation should be handled properly for each level of the multi-index.
- Introduce checks to handle hierarchical columns and perform the unstack operation accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if columns are multi-leveled
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for loc in clocs:
            # Handling unstack operation for each level of multi-index columns
            result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result
    else:
        # Proceed with the regular unstack operation
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

        # Rest of the code handling regular unstack operation
        # ...
```

This corrected version introduces a check for handling multi-leveled columns properly and applying the unstack operation for each level. If the columns are not multi-leveled, it proceeds with the regular unstack operation.
