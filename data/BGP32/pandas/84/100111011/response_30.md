### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails to handle the case where there are tuple names in a MultiIndex. It tries to retrieve the level number for a given tuple name, resulting in an error due to the tuple name being not found in the list of names.

### Bug Location

The bug occurs in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is attempting to retrieve the level number based on the provided tuple name, which leads to the error.

### Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the assumption that the specified level name is present in the list of names, which is not the case when dealing with tuple names in a MultiIndex.

### Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names correctly in MultiIndexes by modifying how it processes the provided level names.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        dummy_index = Index(range(len(data)), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        obs_ids = range(len(data))
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                                  codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
                                  names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
                                  verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version focuses on correctly composing the MultiIndex with tuple names and handling the unstacking operation for MultiIndexes with tuple names. It avoids the error caused by trying to find the level number for tuple names.
