### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the `_get_level_number` method in the `Index` class not handling tuple names properly. When unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex, the function fails to identify the level number, resulting in a KeyError `'Level A not found`.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from passing tuple names as the level parameter for unstacking in a MultiIndex. The `_get_level_number` method expects a single level name but can't handle tuple names correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly when unstacking with MultiIndex. The correction involves checking if the provided level is a tuple and then searching for that tuple name within the MultiIndex.

### Correction to the Buggy Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Modified the line handling level numbers based on tuple names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By making this correction, the function should now properly handle tuple names when unstacking MultiIndex, resolving the KeyError issue.

Feel free to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to verify the fix.
