### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function, specifically at the line where `index._get_level_number(i)` is called. The error arises because the function expects `i` to be a level number, but in this context, `i` is a tuple representing a combination of level names instead. This mismatch causes the function to fail and raise a KeyError.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to access the level number with the `_get_level_number` method, which expects an integer representing the level.
2. In the failing test cases, the parameter `clocs` contains a tuple referring to level names instead of level numbers.
3. This leads to an attempt to retrieve the level number using a tuple, causing an error in the `_get_level_number` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` method should be handled differently for cases where the input is in the form of a tuple representing level names. Since the problematic part is in the initialization of `clocs`, it should be converted to contain the level numbers directly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert clocs from level names to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function follows as it is
    ...
```

### Summary:
By modifying the initialization of `clocs` in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle cases where the input is a tuple of level names, we can resolve the KeyError issue, as reported in the GitHub bug.
