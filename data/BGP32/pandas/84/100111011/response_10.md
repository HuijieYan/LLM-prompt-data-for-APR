### Analysis
1. The `clocs` parameter is a tuple of attribute names, which may cause issues when converting it to level numbers due to the presence of tuple names in the MultiIndex.
2. The `data` DataFrame has a MultiIndex with tuple names, causing the `_get_level_number` function to raise a ValueError due to mismatched names during the conversion to level numbers.
3. The error message indicates that an attempt is made to find the name 'A' (one of the tuple names) as a level in the MultiIndex, resulting in the KeyError 'Level A not found' due to its absence.
4. The `clocs` values are being processed incorrectly, leading to errors during computation, particularly in cases involving MultiIndex with tuple names.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Convert the attributes in `clocs` to level numbers more robustly to handle MultiIndex cases with tuple names.
2. Handle cases where tuple names are present in the MultiIndex by avoiding direct matching of names with levels.
3. Update the `_get_level_number` approach to correctly determine level numbers for such cases.
4. Modify the indexing and unstacking logic to accommodate MultiIndex instances with tuple names more flexibly.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

After applying these fixes to the `_unstack_multiple` function, rerun the failing tests to verify that the bug has been successfully resolved.
