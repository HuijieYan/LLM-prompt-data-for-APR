### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex where the level names are provided as a tuple.
2. The `_get_level_number` method fails to handle the tuple case, resulting in the error.
3. The failing test utilizes a MultiIndex with names provided as a tuple leading to a KeyError in the `_get_level_number` method.
4. The cause of the bug is a mismatch between the expected single name input and the actual tuple input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names by checking if the input is a tuple and processing its elements accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function can correctly interpret and handle tuple names when accessing levels of the MultiIndex.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining implementation remains the same
```

After making the above changes to handle tuple names correctly, the function should now correctly process the MultiIndex provided as input in the failing test, resolving the KeyError issue.
