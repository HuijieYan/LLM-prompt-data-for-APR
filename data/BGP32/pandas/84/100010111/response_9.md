### Bug analysis
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function occurs when attempting to extract the level numbers from a MultiIndex by using the method `_get_level_number`. The method expects the level names as input and should return the corresponding level numbers. However, the current implementation queries the names attribute directly without taking into account the MultiIndex nature, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug identification
The error arises in the section where the level numbers are extracted from the index. The incorrect approach results in the incorrect retrieval of level names instead of level numbers.

### Bug explanation
1. The code is designed to perform an unstacking operation, and to do so, it needs to determine the level numbers of the column to unstack.
2. The list comprehension `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` attempts to extract the level numbers, but the `_get_level_number` method is flawed.
3. The `_get_level_number` method operates on the `names` attribute directly instead of searching for the level names as they are included in a tuple.
4. This issue leads to the ValueError or KeyError, depending on the test input involved, where the level name is not found in the index.

### Bug solution strategy
The function should be updated to correctly handle MultiIndex names that are tuples. The level names should be extracted correctly to obtain their corresponding level numbers, as needed for unstacking operations.

### Updated `_unstack_multiple` function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # Initialize empty lists for different locations
    clocs_num = []
    rlocs = []

    # Extract level numbers for clocs
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_name = tuple(loc)
            # Handle multi-level names
            level_num = index._get_level_number(level_name)
        else:
            level_num = index._get_level_number(loc)
        clocs_num.append(level_num)

    # Process the remaining levels
    for i in range(index.nlevels):
        if i not in clocs_num:
            rlocs.append(i)

    # Remaining implementation as before...
}
```

This updated function correctly handles the extraction of level numbers from the index even when the column names are tuples. It should be able to resolve the issues related to incorrect level number identification.
