### Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `_get_level_number` function within the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The error arises from the attempt to find the index of a level that is specified by tuple names. The issue is related to the handling of tuple names in MultiIndex unstacking operations.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the misinterpretation of tuple names in the `clocs` variable, which are supposed to represent the levels to unstack based on their index. However, the current approach with tuple names isn't handled correctly, resulting in errors when looking up the levels.

### Proposed Fix
To resolve this bug, we need to modify how the levels are determined from tuple names within the MultiIndex. We should parse the tuple names correctly to extract the levels for unstacking. Furthermore, adjustments in the code logic of `_unstack_multiple` are necessary to accommodate tuple names and correctly process the unstacking operation.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.names.index(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version properly handles tuple names and fixes the KeyError issues when unstacking MultiIndex data based on tuple names.
