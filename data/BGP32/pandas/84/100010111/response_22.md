### Bug Analysis:
- The error occurred due to the `._get_level_number()` method within the `_unstack_multiple()` function.
- The input parameter `clocs` should be iterated over and for each element, the level number should be obtained.
- The error happened because the function is trying to get the level number for a tuple, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Inside the function, handle the scenario where the elements of `clocs` are tuples, and get the level number for such cases.
- Check if each element in `clocs` is a tuple; if it is, extract the first element from the tuple.
- Update the corresponding code section to handle this case appropriately.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Extract the level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0] if isinstance(i, tuple) else i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
```

After applying this fix, the `_unstack_multiple()` function should handle the case of `clocs` containing tuples and correctly extract the level number for further processing.
