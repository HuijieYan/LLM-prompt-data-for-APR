### Bug Analysis
The bug is occurring when the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class in pandas is called with a tuple parameter. This leads to a ValueError, which is then caught and a KeyError is raised, causing the failure.

The actual issue happens inside the `_get_level_number` method, where the code expects the `level` parameter to be a single integer level index or name, not a tuple.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function near the beginning when the `clocs` are processed. The issue lies in the fact that the function incorrectly assumes that `clocs` contains integer level numbers or names, causing the error with nested MultiIndex names.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` method is not equipped to handle tuple inputs as they are meant to handle individual level integers or names. When the function passes a tuple to `_get_level_number`, it leads to a failure of the function surrounding unstacking operations with MultiIndex columns.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `clocs` variable in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Instead of directly passing the `clocs` (which is a tuple) as is, we should iterate over it, and for each item in the tuple, convert it into its corresponding index if it's a name before proceeding with the further operations.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By checking if the item in `clocs` is a tuple and converting it to the corresponding index if necessary, we ensure that the function handles both single level indices/names and tuple level names correctly, fixing the bug.
