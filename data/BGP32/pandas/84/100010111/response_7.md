### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing with the KeyError "Level A not found" due to an issue with handling tuple names in MultiIndex during unstacking.
- The function attempts to find the level number in the MultiIndex for a given level, but fails when the level provided is a tuple.
- This bug impacts the unstacking functionality for MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located at line 320 in the original function:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The issue arises when the levels provided in the tuple form are passed to this line for processing.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the assumption that for hierarchical columns, the levels will be passed as integers representing positions in the MultiIndex. However, when the columns are named with tuples, this assumption breaks down, leading to KeyError or ValueError during index processing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Detect when tuple names are passed to the function and handle them appropriately.
2. Check if the level is a tuple name, extract the individual names, find their corresponding levels, and use those levels for further processing.
3. Modify the code to accommodate the mixed type names in the MultiIndex columns for unstacking properly.

### Proposed Fix:
I will provide an updated version of the `_unstack_multiple` function below with modifications to handle tuple names appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function includes handling tuple names appropriately to fix the KeyError issue and enable successful unstacking of MultiIndex columns with mixed type names.
