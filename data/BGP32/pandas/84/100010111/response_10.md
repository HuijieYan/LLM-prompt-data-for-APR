### Analysis:
- The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack a DataFrame based on specified levels.
- The error occurs due to treating a tuple of column names as a single level identifier instead of distinct levels.
- The function is incorrectly accessing levels in a MultiIndex.
- The error message indicates `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` due to `'_get_level_number'` function not handling tuple names correctly.
- The GitHub issue confirms this bug with a failing test related to unstacking a Series with multiple levels with tuple names.
- The function fails to properly handle MultiIndexes with either single or multiple levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Separate out the levels within the tuple of column names to properly identify each level.
2. Adapt the function logic to work with MultiIndexes that have multiple levels specified as tuples accurately.
3. Properly extract the level numbers from the MultiIndex in case of MultiIndex and handle tuple names as a single level identifier.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the original code remains unchanged...
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
1. Check if the `clocs` variable is a tuple. If it is a tuple, extract each part of the tuple and get the level number for each part.
2. If `clocs` is not a tuple, proceed as before to get the level number as a single entry in the list.
3. This modification ensures proper handling of tuple names in the case of multiple levels in the MultiIndex.

By incorporating this fix, the function should now correctly handle MultiIndexed data with tuple names and unstack them accordingly.
