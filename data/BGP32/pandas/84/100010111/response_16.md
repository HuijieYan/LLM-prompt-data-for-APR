### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations on a DataFrame's index.
2. The bug occurs when the input `clocs` parameter is a tuple or list, which it expects to be a list of column level names to unstack from the index.
3. The bug originates from assuming `clocs` will always be a list, causing an error when trying to access the level number of the column names in the index.
4. The error message highlights a KeyError during the attempt to access a level that is not found, caused by the incorrect interpretation of the `clocs` input.
5. To resolve the bug, the function needs to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple, allowing it to extract the necessary column levels correctly and perform the unstacking operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to handle both single-level and multi-level (tuple) column level names for unstacking.
2. When `clocs` is a tuple, convert it into a list before extracting level numbers.
3. Adjust the code flow to account for the different data types of `clocs`.
4. Ensure the function can correctly identify and handle both single and multi-level column names during unstacking.

### Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged from the original implementation
```

This updated version of the function should now be able to handle both single-level and multi-level column names correctly for unstacking the data.
