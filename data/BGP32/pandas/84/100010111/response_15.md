### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The bug occurs due to incorrect processing of the input `clocs`, which is a tuple containing MultiIndex levels and other levels. The `_get_level_number` function expects a single level name as input, therefore passing in a tuple causes an error.
- To fix the bug, we should modify how the `clocs` parameter is processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. We need to handle scenarios where `clocs` contains both MultiIndex levels and other levels separately.
- By iterating over the elements in `clocs` and extracting the level names correctly based on their type, we can resolve the error and ensure proper unstacking of the DataFrame.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process the MultiIndex level names and other level names separately
    multiindex_clocs = [col for col in clocs if isinstance(col, tuple)]
    other_levels_clocs = [col for col in clocs if not isinstance(col, tuple)]

    index = data.index
    cloc_idxs = []
    
    # Get level number for MultiIndex levels
    for cloc in multiindex_clocs:
        level_names = cloc
        level_idxs = []
        for level in level_names:
            level_idx = index._get_level_number(level)
            level_idxs.append(level_idx)
        cloc_idxs.append(level_idxs)

    # Process other levels
    for cloc in other_levels_clocs:
        cloc_idxs.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_idxs]

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

By separating the processing of MultiIndex level names and other level names within the `clocs` input parameter, we can ensure that all levels are correctly processed to unstack the DataFrame as expected.
