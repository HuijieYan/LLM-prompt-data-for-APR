### Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names. The issue arises from how the function `_unstack_multiple` handles finding the level numbers based on the provided tuple names.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the line where the function tries to get the level number based on the tuple names passed as `clocs` input: `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes KeyError because the function `_get_level_number` tries to find the level based on a tuple name, which is not the expected input format. The function expects the individual names instead of a tuple.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the input processing to handle tuple names by splitting them into individual names before getting the level number.
- Ensure that the restructuring and reshaping steps after obtaining level numbers properly account for MultiIndexes with tuple names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The modified section with the input processing now properly handles tuple names for obtaining level numbers within the MultiIndex. This adjustment ensures the function can handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue where tuple names are passed to `unstack`.
