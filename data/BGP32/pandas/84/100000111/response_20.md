### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of multi-index data. It is supposed to work with both Series and DataFrame inputs and unstack them based on the provided `clocs` parameter. The bug seems to arise from misinterpretation of multi-level indexes in the code, especially when extracting level numbers.

### Identified Issue:
The primary issue in the function stems from the conversion of column location specifications (`clocs`) into level numbers for the data's multi-index. The bug causes level identification problems and could lead to KeyErrors or index out of range exceptions when trying to perform unstacking.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `clocs` parameter is expected to be a tuple of column location specifications. However, the code fails to correctly map these column locations to the level numbers in the index.
   
2. The bug emerges from how the function handles hierarchical columns in a multi-index setup. Levels are not processed correctly during the unstacking operation, leading to errors when dealing with multi-level index data.

### Recommendation:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure the mapping of `clocs` to level numbers is done accurately based on the provided data's index.
   
2. Handle the case of hierarchical columns better to avoid misinterpretation of levels during unstacking.

### Updated/Cleaned Implementation:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the level numbers corresponding to the specified column locations
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    
    # Perform unstacking based on the processed column levels
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Prepare dummy index for unstacked data
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                              codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                              names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
                              verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        # Perform unstacking operation for DataFrame input
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    # Reconstruct the new MultiIndex based on unstacked data
    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This revised version of the function should now be able to correctly handle multi-index unstacking based on the specified column locations (`clocs`) for both Series and DataFrame inputs.
