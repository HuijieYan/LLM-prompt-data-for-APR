The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to unstack a DataFrame with multi-level columns when the `clocs` parameter is provided as a tuple. The function is intended to take a list of column locations to operate on, but when a tuple is passed in, it causes the function to fail due to an error with level names.

The bug originates in the handling of the `clocs` parameter, causing issues when trying to access the level number within the multi-level index columns.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` parameter is properly processed as a list of column locations, even when provided as a tuple. We will convert the tuple to a list before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Fix to convert clocs tuple to a list
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    index = data.index

    # Convert clocs to a list to avoid tuple processing issues
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `clocs` parameter when provided as a tuple, ensuring that the unstacking operation on multi-level columns works correctly as expected in all scenarios.
