### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a multi-indexed DataFrame along specific levels. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of the levels specified for unstacking.

In the provided GitHub issue, the user attempted to unstack a Series using `unstack(("A", "a"))`, where `"A"` and `"a"` are meant to specify levels in the MultiIndex. The current implementation is unable to handle this correctly, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to correctly interpret the levels that are specified as the input `clocs`.
2. Ensure that the function can handle the unstacking of Series correctly as well.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle hierarchical columns in clocs
    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    ...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Handle unstacking of Series
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    ...
```

With this correction, the function should unstack multi-indexed data correctly, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
