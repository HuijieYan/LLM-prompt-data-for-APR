### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to aim at transforming a DataFrame with a MultiIndex into an unstacked form.
- The function extracts various properties from the input DataFrame's index like levels, codes, and names to perform the unstacking operation.
- The bug appears to occur when handling multiple level columns (tuple names) during unstacking.
- The bug arises specifically in the approach of identifying the level numbers of the columns to unstack.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The root cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly process hierarchical columns, resulting in a `KeyError` due to improper handling of column index levels.
  
### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
- Modify the function `_unstack_multiple` to correctly handle hierarchical columns by extracting level numbers for unstacking where the `column` parameter consists of multiple levels.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if 'clocs' contains multiple levels for columns
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [c if isinstance(c, int) else data.columns.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Remaining implementation unchanged

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that when `clocs` contains tuple names, they are correctly resolved to column location indices within the DataFrame. This modification should enable the function to handle hierarchical columns properly during unstacking.
