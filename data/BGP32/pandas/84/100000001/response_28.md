There are several potential error locations within the given buggy function `_unstack_multiple`:
1. In the section where the variable `unstacked` is created, there is a conditional block checking whether the data input is a Series or not. Inside the `if` block, the variable `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` are set to specific values based on the data type. However, in the `else` block, there is an issue where `unstcols.levels[0]` and `unstcols.codes[0]` are used without checking the type of the `unstcols` object. This can cause issues when trying to access its attributes using `.` if the object is not a Series.
2. Another potential error location is in the creation of the new MultiIndex `new_columns`, where the `levels`, `codes`, and `names` are created based on the condition checks. If any of these components are not correctly set up, it can lead to errors when trying to assign this MultiIndex to the `unstacked` output.
3. Additionally, the variable `clocs` is being modified inside a `for` loop in the `else` block, potentially causing unintended changes to the original list.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure the proper type checking and handling for `unstcols` before accessing its attributes and make sure that the MultiIndex `new_columns` is created correctly. Additionally, we should avoid modifying the original `clocs` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, I added type checks before accessing attributes of `unstcols`, avoided modifying the original `clocs` list, and ensured that the MultiIndex `new_columns` is created correctly.
