## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a multi-indexed DataFrame or Series based on the specified column locations. It first extracts the necessary data from the input DataFrame or Series, creates a new index structure, unstacks the data, and updates the index based on the unstacked columns.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. In the section where the function handles a non-Series input, there is a condition check for whether the input data has MultiIndex columns. This condition is not properly implemented and may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The indices being redefined inside the loops can lead to discrepancies in the control flow and incorrect variable assignments.
3. There is potential for confusion in tracking index levels, codes, and names during the unstacking process, resulting in incorrect assignment of new_columns.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns. Additionally, the manipulation of index structures and codes during unstacking may result in unexpected behavior across different branches of the function.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the condition for handling MultiIndex columns is correctly implemented with appropriate variable assignments.
2. Maintain a consistent approach to index manipulation and tracking during the unstacking process to avoid discrepancies in assigning new index structures.
3. Validate the structure and alignment of new columns before applying them to the unstacked data.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function now consistently handles the indexing and unstacking process for both Series and DataFrame inputs, ensuring proper alignment of the new columns with the unstacked data.
