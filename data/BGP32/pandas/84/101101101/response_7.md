## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises due to the computation related to hierarchical columns. When the hierarchical columns are involved, the function does not handle the multiple levels correctly, leading to incorrect reshaping and consequently failing the tests.

The bug can be pinpointed to the section of the code where the function is attempting to reconstruct the MultiIndex levels and codes. The function is assuming that there are two levels for reconstruction, which is not valid in the case where hierarchical columns are present.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the way the function processes hierarchical columns. Specifically, we need to ensure that the reconstruction step accounts for the correct number of levels and properly reconstructs the columns based on the hierarchical structure.

## The Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug and should now pass the failing tests:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + rlevels
        new_names = cnames + rnames
        new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By revising the logic for handling hierarchical columns and ensuring proper reconstruction, the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function should now pass the failing tests.
