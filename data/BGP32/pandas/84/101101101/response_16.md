### Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails to correctly handle the unstacking of hierarchical columns when multiple levels of columns are involved. The bug causes issues in correctly reshaping the data and constructing the new columns and index structures, leading to unexpected output.

In the failing test cases provided:
1. The multi-index DataFrame `df` is manipulated using the `unstack` operation with a tuple name 'A' and 'B'.
2. The buggy function fails to properly process this input, leading to incorrectly formatted output that differs from the expected result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the following steps are suggested:
1. Improve the logic for handling hierarchical columns during unstacking.
2. Make adjustments to correctly create new column levels and codes based on the existing data.
3. Ensure appropriate handling of multi-index columns throughout the unstacking process.
4. Align the output with the expected structure and values specified in the failing test cases.
5. Modify the code to handle tuple names in multi-index structures accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the column labels and levels
    cnames = [name if isinstance(name, tuple) else (None, name) for name in clocs]
    clocs = [(name[0], name[1]) for name in clocs]

    # Unstack the DataFrame
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Create new column MultiIndex
    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(unstacked.columns.levels, names=cnames)

    # Reindex the DataFrame with the new columns
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should address the issues in the original `_unstack_multiple` function and provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
