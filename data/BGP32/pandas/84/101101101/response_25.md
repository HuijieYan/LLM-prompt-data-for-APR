## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack data based on specified columns, splitting the columns and redistributing them based on user input. However, the function does not handle all cases correctly, leading to failing tests. The main issue seems to arise from incorrect reorganization of the index and columns when unstacking.

1. The function incorrectly handles the case when partial multi-index is passed as `clocs`.
2. The reorganization of index and columns during unstacking is not correctly implemented.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, I suggest the following improvements:
1. Add proper handling for the case when partial multi-index is passed as `clocs`.
2. Ensure the correct reorganization of index and columns when unstacking is performed.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    cloc_indices = [data.columns.get_loc(col) if isinstance(col, tuple) else data.columns.get_loc((col,)) for col in clocs]

    if any(idx == -1 for idx in cloc_indices):
        raise KeyError("Some columns to unstack were not found.")

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_indices, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By checking for missing columns and handling the unstacking correctly for both DataFrame and Series objects, we address the bugs present in the original function. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected input-output values.
