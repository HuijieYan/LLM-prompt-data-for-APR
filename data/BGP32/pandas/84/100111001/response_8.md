### Analysis
1. The error occurs when trying to get the level number of a column in a MultiIndex. The function `_get_level_number` is trying to find the index of a level name, which is causing the errors.
2. The `clocs` parameter is a tuple containing column names. The function is trying to convert these names to level numbers inside a MultiIndex object.
3. The error message shows that the function is attempting to find a level name (`'A'`) that does not exist in the list of names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the conversion from column names to level numbers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the input is a string and not a tuple.
2. If it is a string, extract the first element as the column name.
3. Update the code to handle both string input (single column name) and tuple input (multiple column names).

### Updated Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, str):  # Handle single column name case
        clocs = (clocs,)
    
    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) if i in index.names else -1 for i in clocs]

    if -1 in clocs:  # Check if any column name was not found
        raise KeyError(f"Level {clocs[clocs.index(-1)]} not found")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
```

With this fix, the function should be able to correctly handle extracting the level numbers from column names provided in both single and multiple input formats. The function should now pass the failing tests.
