### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method when trying to find the index of a specific level name. The error is caused by passing a tuple `(A, a)` as the level name, which is not present in the list of level names.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle multi-level names correctly. We should check if the input is a tuple and then iterate over its elements to find the corresponding level numbers. If the input is not a tuple, then we can proceed as before.

### Updated _get_level_number function:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        levels = []
        for name in level:
            count = self.names.count(name)
            if (count > 1) and not is_integer(name):
                raise ValueError(f"The name {name} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
            try:
                level_num = self.names.index(name)
            except ValueError:
                level_num = None
            levels.append(level_num)
        return levels
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name `{level}` occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level_num = self.names.index(level)
            return level_num
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level `{level}` not found")
```

### Updated _unstack_multiple function:
We need to call the modified `_get_level_number` function and handle the scenario where a tuple is passed as a parameter as in the failing tests.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = _get_level_number(index, clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    ...
```

By updating the logic in `_get_level_number` and correctly handling tuples as levels in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we can fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
