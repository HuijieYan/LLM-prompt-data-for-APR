### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the handling of the `clocs` variable when it contains nested tuples, such as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`. When the function tries to get the level number (index) corresponding to the entries in `clocs`, it fails to correctly identify them because it expects the entries to be a single level name instead of a tuple of multiple level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify how the function handles the `clocs` input when it contains nested tuples. We need to check each item in `clocs` and if it is a tuple, we should flatten the tuples into a single list of level names before processing them.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_flat = [i if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i[0] for i in clocs]
    clocs_flat = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs_flat]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_flat]

    # Remaining code remains the same as the original function

```

By flattening the nested tuples into a single list of level names before getting the level numbers, we ensure that the function can correctly process the levels and address the key error in handling nested tuples. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
