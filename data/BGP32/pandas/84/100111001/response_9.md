### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_level_number` is trying to find the index of a level name ('A') that is actually a tuple ('A', 'a'). This mismatch in data types leads to the error messages as shown in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the level numbers are calculated when multiple levels are passed as a tuple. We should handle the case where a tuple of multiple levels is passed by recursively getting the level numbers for each level in the tuple.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_tuple_numbers = []
            for level_name in cloc:
                level_number = index._get_level_number(level_name)
                cloc_tuple_numbers.append(level_number)
            cloc_numbers.append(tuple(cloc_tuple_numbers))
        else:
            cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
            cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This fix ensures that we correctly handle tuples in the `clocs` parameter, recursively getting the level numbers for each level in the tuple. This modification should resolve the issue and make the function compatible with multi-level indices provided in tuples.
