The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the creation of new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame. When dealing with hierarchical columns, the function incorrectly assigns names and codes, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from incorrect handling of hierarchical columns when unstacking a DataFrame. In the buggy function, the new levels, names, and codes are created improperly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the creation of new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame is done correctly within the function. Specifically, when dealing with hierarchical columns, we should accurately assign the names and codes based on the unstacking operation. Additionally, it's important to consider cases where the input data is a Series or contains a MultiIndex in the columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + clevels
        new_names = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [None] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for i, rec in enumerate(recons_codes):
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[i+1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with creating new levels, names, and codes during the unstacking process, ensuring a proper unstacking operation for both Series and DataFrame inputs with hierarchical columns.
