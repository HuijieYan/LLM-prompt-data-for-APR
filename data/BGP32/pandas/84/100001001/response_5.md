The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of the column levels and codes when unstacking the data. The function is designed to unstack a DataFrame based on specific column locations (`clocs`) provided.

In the provided case, the function fails to correctly reassemble the unstacked data after creating a dummy index based on the selected columns. The issue lies in how the new column levels, names, and codes are determined during the unstacking process.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for reconstructing the column levels and codes. Specifically, when dealing with multiple column levels, we need to properly concatenate the existing levels and codes with the new ones generated during unstacking.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids] + clevels
        new_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"] + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids] + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = unstcols.levels + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = unstcols.codes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with reconstructing the column levels and codes after unstacking the data, ensuring that the unstacked DataFrame is correctly formatted according to the specified column locations.
