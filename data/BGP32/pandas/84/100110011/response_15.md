### Analysis:
1. The `unstack` operation fails when using tuple names in a MultiIndex.
2. The failing test shows that the bug originates from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `reshape.py` file.
3. The error occurs when trying to get the level number using the `._get_level_number()` method, where a ValueError or KeyError is raised depending on the situation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the improper handling of tuple names when accessing the level number.
2. The code fails to handle tuple names given in the form of `(A, a)` properly, leading to the ValueError or KeyError.
3. The `_get_level_number` method encounters issues with tuple names and does not handle them correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct handling of tuple names when getting the level number.
2. Modify the `_get_level_number` method to correctly handle tuple names without raising exceptions.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level, names):
        count = names.count(level)
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level = tuple(col[0] for col in level)  # Convert tuple names to simple tuples
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return level

    clocs = [get_level_number(i, index.names) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining code remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

After replacing the `_unstack_multiple` function with the corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass without any ValueError or KeyError related to level or name errors.
