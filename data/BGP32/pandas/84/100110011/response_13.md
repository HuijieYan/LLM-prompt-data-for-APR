### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an issue with the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class.
2. The failing test cases are related to unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex.
3. The error message suggests a `ValueError` due to `'A' is not in list` which then raises a `KeyError` for `'Level A not found`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex causes a `KeyError`.
5. The bug arises from incorrect handling of tuple names in MultiIndex while attempting to unstack.

### Bug Details:
- The `-get_level_number` method is expecting a level name, and in the buggy function, it tries to get the level number from the list of provided names.
- When it encounters tuple names like `('A', 'a')`, it does not handle them correctly, leading to the errors.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly by considering them as a single entity.
- Update the code in `_unstack_multiple` function to account for tuple names while determining the level numbers.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By updating the `_get_level_number` for handling tuple names and appropriately modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function, the bug can be fixed to address the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
