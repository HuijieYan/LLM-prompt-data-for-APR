### Analysis:
1. The `_get_level_number` function inside the `MultiIndex` class is throwing a `KeyError` because it can't find the specified level which is a tuple name.
2. The bug occurs when trying to unstack a DataFrame with an index having tuples as names. This is evident from the failing test cases provided.
3. The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, is failing to handle MultiIndexed unstack operations with tuple names.
4. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` occurs while trying to index the level name in the MultiIndex.
5. The GitHub issue confirms this bug by providing a similar scenario where unstacking a Series with tuple names fails with a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function's inability to handle MultiIndexed data where names of levels are tuples. The function tries to index into the level names but fails because it expects individual strings as level names, not tuple names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function so that it can handle multi-level column names (tuples) during the unstacking operation. The function should be updated to properly retrieve the level numbers based on the provided tuple names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By modifying the `clocs` selection to handle tuple names appropriately and adapting other parts for multi-level unstacking, we can address the bug and allow the function to handle multi-level column names correctly.
