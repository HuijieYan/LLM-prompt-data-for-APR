### Analysis:
1. The `DataFrame` unstack operation with tuple names fails due to a KeyError.
2. The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method from the `MultiIndex` class.
3. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` highlights the issue when unstacking with tuple names.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that unstacking with tuple names is resulting in an error, leading to a KeyError in the `_get_level_number` method.
  
### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug originates from attempting to access levels with tuple names in the `MultiIndex` while extracting the level number.
2. The `_get_level_number` method encounters a ValueError when trying to find the index of the tuple name, resulting in a KeyError being raised due to the error handling logic of the method.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly with correct level indexing.
2. Check if the provided level is a tuple and extract the appropriate level number based on the tuple name.
  
### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Adjust for tuple names in MultiIndex
    def get_level_number(midx, level):
        tup_level = ()
        for named_level in level:
            tup_level += (named_level,)
        count = midx.names.count(tup_level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(
                f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
            )
        try:
            level = midx.names.index(tup_level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return level

    clocs = [get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code unchanged for context
```

Running this corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should resolve the issue and make the unstack operation with tuple names in `MultiIndex` work correctly.
