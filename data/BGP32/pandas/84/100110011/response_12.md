### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` in `test_reshape.py` demonstrates that unstacking a dataframe with tuple names in a MultiIndex fails with a KeyError.
2. The error originates from the `_unstack_multiple` function in `reshape.py`. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to obtain the level number for a given level using `index._get_level_number(i)`.
3. The failing test reveals that the named levels are tuples (e.g., `("A", "a")`), which causes an issue with `_get_level_number` method as it facilitates single depth name lookup and raises an error since it expects a string or integer.
4. The GitHub issue complaint corroborates this problem, indicating that unstacking with tuple names leads to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To rectify the bug, we should modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuples as names correctly. One approach is to adjust the function to find the level number based on the string representation of the tuple names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

Applying this modification will enable the function to properly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex levels when performing unstacking operations.
