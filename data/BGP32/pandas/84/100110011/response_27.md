### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle the unstacking of multi-level indices in pandas DataFrames.
2. The error message in the failing test indicates that there is an issue with the `_get_level_number` function when handling the tuple names in the MultiIndex.
3. The failing test is designed to test unstacking operations with tuple names in the MultiIndex, where the current implementation fails due to an error in handling non-integer level names.
4. The error occurs due to the code trying to treat the tuple names as integers, leading to the KeyError.
5. The GitHub issue explains a similar problem where unstacking operations with tuple names cause errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, where it fails to correctly handle non-integer levels represented as tuples in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex. Specifically, we need to ensure that when non-integer level names are encountered, appropriate handling is done without trying to treat them as integers.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    lvl_counts = index.names.value_counts()
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if lvl_counts[i] <= 1 else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify non-integer level names and handle them appropriately, resolving the KeyError caused by trying to treat them as integers.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
