### Analysis:
The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class not handling tuple names correctly when attempting to unstack a multi-level index with tuple names.

### Bug Cause:
When executing `df.unstack(("A", "a"))`, the `MultiIndex` object in the DataFrame `df` is unable to resolve the level specified by the tuple `("A", "a")`. This is due to the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class not being able to handle tuple names correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class to correctly handle tuple names by extracting the levels from the tuple.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to validate and extract levels correctly based on the provided `clocs` input, especially when dealing with tuple names.
3. Adjust the unstacking logic to ensure the correct levels are selected and processed for unstacking.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    # Extract level numbers for tuple names in clocs
    cloc_levels = [index._get_level_number(i[1]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Continue with unstacking logic and multi-index creation as before
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names correctly in the `clocs` input, the function should now be able to correctly unstack multi-level indexes with tuple names.

Feel free to further test and integrate this fixed version into the pandas library.
