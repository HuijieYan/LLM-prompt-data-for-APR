### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an issue in handling multi-level indices where Tuple names are used. The `clocs` parameter being passed to the function does not match the structure of the MultiIndex `data.index`, resulting in the KeyError.

### Error Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function expects `clocs` to be level names directly, but in the case of tuple names in MultiIndex, it doesn't handle them correctly. The `_get_level_number` function used to convert level names to level numbers fails to handle tuple names correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected level structure and the provided `clocs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the handling of `clocs` to account for tuple names in MultiIndex structures.
2. When encountering a tuple name, identify the corresponding levels and handle them appropriately to extract level numbers.
3. Ensure that the `clocs` passed to `_unstack_multiple` match the structure expected by the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if all(isinstance(x, tuple) for x in clocs):
        clocs = [i for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same...
``` 

This corrected function handles both regular level names and tuple names in MultiIndex structures. Now, it should be able to successfully unstack multi-level indices with tuple names, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
