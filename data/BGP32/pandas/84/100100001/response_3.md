## Analysis:
The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack data based on multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The function extracts certain levels and performs unstacking based on the given criteria. The bug likely resides in the indexing and unstacking process.

The failing test cases involve unstacking on MultiIndex names that may contain tuples or mixed types, leading to discrepancies in index and column generation.

## Bug Identification:
The bug occurs when unstacking MultiIndex with tuple names or mixed type names. The bug is likely due to improper handling of MultiIndex levels, codes, and names during the unstacking process.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect indexing and assignment of levels, codes, and names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Specifically, the function fails to properly handle MultiIndex columns with tuple names or mixed types, leading to mismatched index and column structures in the output.

## Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, proper mapping of levels, codes, and names should be carried out during the unstacking process. The function needs to correctly extract and reconstruct the index and column structure based on the unstacking criteria provided.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [unstacked.columns.names[-1]] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[-1]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle unstacking of MultiIndex with tuple names or mixed types, addressing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
