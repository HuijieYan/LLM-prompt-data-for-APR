### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame based on multiple levels of the index. It handles both single-level and multi-level indices. The bug seems to be related to the handling of multi-level indices. The function tries to unstack the DataFrame based on the specified levels, but there are issues with reconstructing the columns and index correctly.

### Error Location:
1. Incorrect handling of multi-level columns during unstacking.
2. Issues with defining new columns and index after unstacking.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect reconstruction of the columns and index after unstacking a DataFrame with multi-level columns. The function fails to properly match the column levels and codes, leading to incorrect column construction.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the column levels and codes are correctly mapped after unstacking.
2. Create a new MultiIndex for columns based on the unstacked result to maintain hierarchy and integrity.
3. Update the column names and index based on the new MultiIndex after unstacking.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [obs_ids] + clevels
        new_names = ["__placeholder__"] + cnames
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=recons_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

After applying the corrections to the `_unstack_multiple` function, it should now handle the unstacking of DataFrames with multi-level indices correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
