## Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of multi-index data in a DataFrame. The function extracts the necessary information such as levels, codes, and names from the index of the input data, performs the unstack operation, and then reconstructs the MultiIndex columns.

The error occurs in cases where the input data's columns are MultiIndex and the unstack operation is being done on hierarchical columns. The current implementation contains conditional logic to handle this scenario, but it results in incorrect ordering of the columns after unstacking. This inconsistency leads to the failing test cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of multi-level columns during the unstack operation. Specifically, in the section where the function checks if the input data's columns are MultiIndex and iterates over the levels in `data.columns`, the logic for adjusting the column values based on the unstack operation is flawed.

When the unstack operation is performed on a hierarchical column index, the function fails to correctly reorder the columns, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles the case where the input data has MultiIndex columns during the unstack operation. This involves appropriately adjusting the column values to align with the unstacked data while maintaining the correct ordering.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract required index information
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Special handling for hierarchical columns unstacking
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        keep_cols = list(data.columns.names)
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            # Unstack inner level, maintain overall column order
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            keep_cols.remove(keep_cols[val])
        # Reorder the columns based on original order
        result = result[sorted(result.columns, key=lambda x: keep_cols.index(x[1]))]
        return result

    # Standard unstacking
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    # Remaining indices for re-stacking
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same
```

By adjusting the logic for handling MultiIndex columns during the unstack operation, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle hierarchical columns unstacking.
