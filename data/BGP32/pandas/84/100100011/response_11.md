### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack multi-index data. The bug arises from the section where the function tries to get the level number of each column location (`clocs`). The bug causes a `KeyError` when trying to extract the level number using the column names.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function assumes that `clocs` contains column names, but in the failing test case, `clocs` can actually contain tuples of names for multi-level columns. This causes the `KeyError`, as the function is unable to find the level number for a tuple that represents a multi-level column.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the elements in `clocs` are tuples instead of column names if the columns are multi-level.
2. If tuples are present in `clocs`, extract the individual level names and get their corresponding level numbers.
3. Use these level numbers to build the `clocs` list to proceed with unstacking.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else tuple(index._get_level_number(n) for n in i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function implementation remains unchanged
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should be able to handle the multi-level columns successfully, addressing the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing test case described in the GitHub issue.
