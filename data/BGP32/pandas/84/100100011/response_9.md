### Issue Analysis:
From the failing test case and the related GitHub issue, it can be observed that the unstack operation on a MultiIndex with tuple names like `("A", "a")` fails with a KeyError. The root cause seems to be the `_unstack_multiple` function not correctly handling the tuple names when attempting to get the level numbers.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. The line where `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is used to get the level numbers based on the tuple names.
2. The section where `cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]` is used to collect the names of the levels.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the usage of tuple names in the `clocs` list within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function treats the tuple as a single name and fails to find the corresponding level number in the index. This results in a KeyError during the unstack operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic where the level numbers are extracted to handle tuple names correctly.
2. Ensure proper handling of tuple names in both level number extraction and name collection.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Handle tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By explicitly checking if the element in `clocs` is a tuple and handling it accordingly when getting the level number, we can fix the bug and ensure the unstack operation works correctly for MultiIndex with tuple names.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and enable the failing test to pass successfully.
