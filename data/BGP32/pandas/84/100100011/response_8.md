### Analysis:
The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking on multi-index data. The bug lies in the way it tries to determine the level number for a given column. The issue seems to be related to handling tuple names in multi-index columns.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises when trying to unstack multi-index columns that have tuple names. The function incorrectly handles the tuple names for multi-index columns and raises a KeyError, as it fails to find the level number. This leads to an improper unstacking operation.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tuple names when determining the level number for the columns. We need to ensure that the function can handle multi-index columns with tuple names properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handling tuple names in multi-index columns
    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...

```

The modification includes handling tuple names by using `index.get_loc(i)` instead of `_get_level_number(i)` when the column name is a tuple. This modification ensures that tuple names in multi-index columns are correctly handled.

By implementing this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to unstack multi-index columns with tuple names correctly, resolving the KeyError issue and improving the overall functionality.
