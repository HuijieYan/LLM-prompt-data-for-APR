### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame or Series with multiple levels. The bug seems to be related to handling hierarchical columns in the unstacking process, as indicated by the comment in the buggy function.
The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` creates a DataFrame with a MultiIndex having tuples as level names and attempts to unstack based on one level of the MultiIndex. The bug seems to occur when unstacking using tuple names in MultiIndex, resulting in a KeyError when trying to extract the level number.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the use of tuple names in the MultiIndex when unstacking. The function `_get_level_number` in the `MultiIndex` class expects a single level name as input, but when tuple names are passed, it causes a KeyError because the tuple `'A'` cannot be found directly as a level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names correctly when extracting level numbers. We should identify the hierarchy in the MultiIndex based on the tuple names and extract the correct level numbers accordingly.

### Bug-fix approach:
We need to modify how the level numbers are extracted when dealing with hierarchical columns in the MultiIndex. Specifically, when tuple names are used in the MultiIndex, we need to handle them appropriately to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index to analyze its levels
    index = data.index

    # Handle tuple names in MultiIndex
    clocs = [
        tuple([i]) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i
        for i in clocs
    ]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    # Modification to handle tuple names
    if any(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when tuple names are passed in `clocs` by checking if the element is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we directly use it as a level number. Otherwise, we extract the level number as before.

By making this adjustment, the bug related to tuple names in MultiIndex should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle unstacking based on tuple names.
