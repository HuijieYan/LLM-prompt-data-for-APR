### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used in the context of unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function attempts to handle the unstacking process across multiple levels of the index. However, it fails to properly address hierarchical columns yet.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the function `_unstack_multiple` specifically when getting the level number for each item in `clocs` (a list of column locations). The issue arises when trying to get the level number of a MultiIndex having tuple names.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that `index._get_level_number` method is not designed to handle tuple names in MultiIndex properly. When a tuple name like `('A', 'a')` is passed to `_get_level_number`, it raises a `KeyError` because it tries to use the entire tuple as the level name, causing the failure in handling this specific case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle the case when the level name is a tuple. It should be adapted to extract the components of the tuple and correctly handle them as the level names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue with tuple names:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    clocs_names = [i if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i[0] for i in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining implementation remains the same
```

By modifying the code to extract only the first element of the tuple for the column names, we ensure that the level number retrieval works correctly for MultiIndex with tuple names.

### Summary:
The bug was caused by the inability of the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly. By modifying the function to extract the relevant component of the tuple, we prevent the `KeyError` and ensure the correct unstacking functionality for MultiIndex with tuple names.
