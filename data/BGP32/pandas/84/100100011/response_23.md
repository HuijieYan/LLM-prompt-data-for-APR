### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The issue arises when trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex containing tuple names. The test cases provided in the failing test files demonstrate the problem and expected results.

### Bug Location:
The issue is likely to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the part where it tries to handle levels and index for the data provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes a KeyError because the function is trying to extract level numbers from the provided clocs (column locations) based on index levels. When dealing with MultiIndexes that have tuple names, the function encounters issues due to the tuple-based naming not being handled properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles MultiIndex columns with tuple names when unstacking the data. This includes adjusting how the column locations are extracted and handled to account for tuple names.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the MultiIndex levels and codes
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_loc_level(i) for i in clocs]

    # Separate the locations based on column order and index order
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Unstack the data
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            unstacked.columns.values, names=cnames
        )
    else:
        # For DataFrame, iterate over clocs and unstack based on values
        unstacked = data
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            [(c[0],) + t for t in unstacked.columns.values],
            names=[data.columns.names[0]] + cnames,
        )
        for i, val in enumerate(clocs):
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked, new_columns
```

This corrected version should address the issue related to unstacking MultiIndexed DataFrame columns with tuple names and ensure that the provided test cases pass successfully.
