### Analysis:
The `_unstack_multiple` function is supposed to handle unstacking of data based on multiple levels in a multi-index DataFrame. The function appears to have a bug related to handling hierarchical columns that leads to a `KeyError` when trying to unstack using tuple names.

### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The error may be in the section where it extracts levels, codes, and names based on `clocs` and `rlocs`.
2. Another possible error may be in the section dealing with creating a new columns MultiIndex.
3. Lastly, problems might arise while setting the index or columns of the unstacked data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function results from issues related to how it processes hierarchical columns. When trying to unstack using tuple names in a multi-index DataFrame, the function fails due to incorrect handling of the levels and names. This leads to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in `_unstack_multiple`, the code needs to correctly identify and handle hierarchical columns. Specifically, the extraction of levels, codes, and names based on the given levels should be revised. Additionally, attention should be given to creating a new MultiIndex with the correct levels, codes, and names based on the unstacking operation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function should now correctly handle unstacking data with tuple names in a multi-index DataFrame without raising a `KeyError` as previously observed.
