### Analysis:
The `buggy function` `_unstack_multiple` seems to handle unstacking of hierarchical columns but has issues when dealing with tuple names in MultiIndex. The failing test cases are explicitly related to unstacking MultiIndex with tuple names, which is where the bug is causing a KeyError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it tries to resolve the level names by calling `_get_level_number` method but encounters a KeyError when dealing with tuple names in MultiIndex.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the fact that `_get_level_number` method in the code assumes single string levels when determining the level number. This approach fails when tuple names are present in MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be modified to handle tuple names in MultiIndex correctly. This involves updating the logic for determining the level number to support both single string levels and tuple names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

### Summary:
The bug originates from the assumption made in `_get_level_number` method within the `_unstack_multiple` function. By updating this logic to handle tuple names in MultiIndex correctly, the bug can be resolved. The corrected version provided above should address the issue and enable the function to pass the failing test cases related to unstacking MultiIndex with tuple names.
