### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on multiple levels of a MultiIndex.
2. The error occurs when trying to determine the level number based on the provided `clocs` (columns) in the index.
3. The error is triggered by passing a tuple as the level name (e.g., `("A", "a")`) instead of a simple string as expected.
4. The failing test case demonstrates this issue when trying to unstack with tuple names.
5. The GitHub issue highlights an error message due to a KeyError when accessing the level number for the passed tuple name.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function expecting simple string names for levels but encountering tuple names, leading to a KeyError.
- The bug occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` when trying to convert tuple names to level numbers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to handle tuple names by extracting the individual level names from the tuple names.
2. Retrieve the level numbers for the extracted individual level names.
3. Replace the tuple names in the `clocs` list with the corresponding level numbers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, str) else i
        for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

Applying this correction to handle tuple names correctly will allow the function to work as intended and pass the failing test case.
