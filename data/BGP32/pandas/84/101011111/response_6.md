The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to extract the level number from a MultiIndex using tuple names such as `('A', 'a')`. However, the function `_get_level_number` expects the input to be either a level number or a single label, not a tuple of labels.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `clocs` variable is processed in the function `_unstack_multiple`. Since the function `_get_level_number` is not prepared to handle tuple names, we should replace the code that attempts to get the level number with a custom method that directly handles the tuple names for the MultiIndex.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _custom_get_level_number(index, label):
    if isinstance(label, tuple):
        names = index.names
        for i, name in enumerate(names):
            if label == name:
                return i
        raise KeyError(f'Level {label} not found')
    elif isinstance(label, int):
        return label
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid label {label}. Expected an integer or tuple.")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_custom_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i).unique() for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.get_level_values(i).codes for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i).unique() for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.get_level_values(i).codes for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this corrected version of the function, it properly handles tuple names when extracting the level number from a MultiIndex. This change should make the function work correctly with the failing test cases provided.
