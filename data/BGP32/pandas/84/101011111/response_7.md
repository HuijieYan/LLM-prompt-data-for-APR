The bug stems from the `_get_level_number` function being called with a tuple argument ('A', 'a') instead of a single level name within the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`. This leads to the error due to the assumption that the input level argument is a single name, causing a KeyError. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` variable in `_unstack_multiple` is correctly handled when it contains tuples (multi-level names). This involves modifying the way the function processes the `clocs` list to correctly extract level numbers based on single or multi-level names.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple clocs to list
    if all(isinstance(cloc, tuple) for cloc in clocs):
        clocs = [item for sublist in clocs for item in sublist]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function body remains the same
``` 

By adding a step to convert tuples in `clocs` to a flat list before getting the level numbers, the function will be able to correctly handle multi-level names as input. This modification should resolve the KeyError caused by passing a tuple as the level parameter in the unstack operation.
