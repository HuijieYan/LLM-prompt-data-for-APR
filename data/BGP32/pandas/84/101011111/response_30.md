## Correction of the Bug in the Buggy Function

The issue in the buggy function arises from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex objects and the levels and codes associated with them. 

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to handle the unstacking operation for hierarchical columns but fails to appropriately manage the levels and codes, resulting in the KeyError when trying to access a non-existent level.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the levels and codes are correctly manipulated based on the provided `clocs` parameter. We should ensure that the list comprehension to get the level numbers accounts for the levels' tuple structure and correct indexing. Additionally, appropriately constructing the new columns MultiIndex and updating the unstacked DataFrame or Series based on the revised columns structure is crucial for successful unstacking.

The key points to fix the bug are:
- Properly extract level numbers from the MultiIndex based on the tuple naming convention.
- Correctly construct new levels, columns, and codes for the unstacked result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = [index.get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[level] for level in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[level] for level in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[level] for level in clevel_numbers]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, ccodes[0].shape, ccodes[0], xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With these corrections, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now address the unstacking operation for MultiIndexed DataFrames and Series correctly, resolving the KeyError issues that occurred due to incorrect level identification and column reconstruction.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle the unstacking of DataFrames and Series with multi-level columns.
