The issue in the buggy function arises from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns in the _unstack_multiple function. When handling clocs with values of Tuple types, the function tries to convert the level names to their corresponding numerical positions within the index, but incorrectly identifies the names leading to KeyError issues.

To resolve this bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to correctly identify the level names supplied in clocs. The function should parse these names based on the values given in the MultiIndex columns correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    c_levels = set(level if isinstance(level, str) else level for level in clocs)
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in c_levels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same
```

This corrected function ensures that it properly handles the level names passed as a tuple in clocs and converts them to their corresponding numerical positions in the MultiIndex columns to prevent KeyError from occurring.

By implementing this fix, the failing test cases should pass, and the bug causing the KeyError should be resolved.
