## Solution:

The issue arises because the `clocs` parameter is a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, but the `_get_level_number` function expects the level name to be a single string, causing it to throw a `ValueError`. To resolve this, we need to unpack the tuple containing the MultiIndex's levels and include the individual levels in the list `clocs` to correctly retrieve the level number. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_list = []  # Create an empty list to hold unpacked MultiIndex levels

    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            clocs_list.extend(loc)
        else:
            clocs_list.append(loc)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs_list]  # Use unpacked clocs_list

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same...

``` 

By unpacking the tuple components in `clocs` and updating the loop that retrieves the level numbers, we can resolve the KeyError being thrown and correctly handle the unstacking operation for MultiIndex with tuple names. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
