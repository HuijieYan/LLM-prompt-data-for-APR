### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a MultiIndex object in a DataFrame based on the passed `level` indices.
2. The error message highlights that the function is trying to retrieve the level number from the index but encounters a `ValueError` or `KeyError` when the specified level is not found in the list of names.
3. The cause of the error is that the input level is a tuple of names `(level1, level2, ...)` instead of a single level name or number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the input level is a tuple of names correctly and extract the corresponding level numbers.
5. The updated function should be able to handle both single level names/numbers and tuple names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `level` input is a tuple or a single level.
2. If it's a tuple, extract the individual level names.
3. Get the level numbers for each extracted level name.
4. Update the rest of the function to account for the possibility of multiple levels in the input.
5. Modify the data structure creation to handle multi-level indices appropriately.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Check if the input level is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        levels = clocs
        clocs = []
        for level in levels:
            clocs.append(data.index._get_level_number(level))
    else:
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multiple levels in the input, the bug causing the `ValueError` or `KeyError` will be resolved. This fix ensures that the function properly extracts the level numbers from the input, whether it's a single level or a tuple of levels.
