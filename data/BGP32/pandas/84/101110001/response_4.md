### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is responsible for handling unstacking operations on Hierarchical DataFrames in pandas.
- The error arises from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` stating that the provided level name `A` is not found.
- The function `_unstack_multiple` is incorrectly calling `_get_level_number` on the index with a tuple instead of a string, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug can be fixed by modifying the input passed to the `_get_level_number` method to be a string instead of a tuple.
- Since `clocs` contains level names, we need to iterate over the tuples and extract the first element (which represents the level name) before passing it to `_get_level_number`.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]  # Change here

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly identify the level names to unstack the Hierarchical DataFrame without raising a `ValueError`.
