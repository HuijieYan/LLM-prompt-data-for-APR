### Analysis
The `_get_level_number` method is throwing errors because it is expecting a single level name but is receiving a tuple instead. This error is causing the entire unstacking process to fail.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `clocs` list is being used without proper handling for multi-index names.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function expects a single level name but is receiving a tuple name. This causes the `_get_level_number` method to fail, leading to errors in the unstacking process.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-index names correctly. Specifically, we need to check if the name provided is a tuple and then extract the individual level names from it before using `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else tuple([index._get_level_number(j) for j in i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same as the original function
```

By making this modification, the function should now be able to handle tuple names as input for levels during unstacking operations.
