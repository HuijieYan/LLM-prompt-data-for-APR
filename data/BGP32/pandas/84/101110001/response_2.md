### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the `unstack` operation in pandas.
2. The error occurs when trying to get the level number of a specified level in the MultiIndex.
3. The error arises due to incorrect handling of the input level when indexing into the `names` of the MultiIndex.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the input level is correctly processed and handled in the `_get_level_number` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the input level is correctly processed before trying to find its index in the names of the MultiIndex.
2. Properly handle the case where the input level is a tuple of levels for a MultiIndex.
3. Update the handling of levels to ensure that the correct level number is retrieved.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify the code below to handle tuple input for MultiIndex levels
    clocs = [index.get_loc(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

Applying this fix should address the issue where the level is not found in the list of names within the MultiIndex.
