### Analysis:
1. The `multi.py` file shows that the `KeyError` is raised when `_get_level_number` function is unable to find the specified level.
2. The `unstack` method in the failing test is passing a tuple `("A", "a")` as the level argument, which is causing the KeyError to be raised.
3. The `multi.py` file utilizes the `names` attribute to search for the level, but since the level is nested in a tuple it cannot be directly found leading to the KeyError.
4. The failing test expects the dataframe to be unstacked properly but the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function leads to the KeyError and prevents the correct unstacking.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when attempting to retrieve the level number from the MultiIndex object using the `index._get_level_number(i)` call. This call is unable to locate the level correctly when the level is nested within a tuple, leading to the KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
As the `names` attribute expects a single level name but is getting a tuple in the failing test, we need to update the function to handle tuple level names correctly. This can be achieved by checking if the level is a tuple and navigating properly to find the correct level.

### Correction:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(idx, level):
        count = idx.names.count(level)
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            for l in level:
                count = idx.names.count(l)
                if count == 1:
                    return idx.names.index(l)
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(
                f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
            )
        try:
            return idx.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple level names, we can address the KeyErrors and successfully unstack the dataframe as expected.
