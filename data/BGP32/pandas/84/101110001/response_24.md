### Analysis:
- The error messages indicate that the `_get_level_number` method is raising a `KeyError` or `ValueError` because the passed level is not found in the list of names.
- The issue seems to be related to the way the level is being passed to `_get_level_number`, which is causing it to fail.
- The failing tests provide detailed information about the expected behavior of the `unstack` function, which is currently not being achieved due to the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The issue is in how the `clocs` (column locations) are processed inside the `_unstack_multiple` function.
- The `_get_level_number` method expects the level to be a tuple, as in the failing tests, but the current implementation is passing the individual elements of the tuple separately, leading to the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change the way the `clocs` are handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly pass the tuple of levels instead of individual elements.
- Update the logic to properly handle hierarchical columns in MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [c for c in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

After making this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle the tuple of levels correctly and pass the failing tests.
