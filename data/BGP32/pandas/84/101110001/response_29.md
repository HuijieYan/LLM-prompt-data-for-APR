### Analysis:
1. The `_get_level_number` function is used within the `_unstack_multiple` function to get the level number based on the level name.
2. The `_get_level_number` function is raising a `ValueError` stating that the level is not in the list.
3. This leads to the subsequent `KeyError` due to the level not being found when accessing the index.
4. The error occurs because the level name is a tuple instead of a single level name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle the case where the level name is a tuple by iterating over each level name and checking for the matching tuple.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to use this modified `_get_level_number` function to handle tuples as input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        levels = [item for item in level for item in item]  # Flattening the tuple
    else:
        levels = [level]

    for idx, name in enumerate(self.names):
        if name == levels:
            return idx
    raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function body remains the same
```

Applying this fix will handle the tuple-based level name input correctly and resolve the associated `ValueError` and `KeyError` issues.
