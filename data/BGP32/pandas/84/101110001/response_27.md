### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame but encounters an error when trying to get the level number of the columns.
2. The error occurs because the function is expecting the level names as strings but receives a tuple of names instead.
3. The error arises from calling `index._get_level_number(i)` where `i` is a tuple of names.
4. The error messages indicate that the function is trying to find a level name that is not present in the list of level names.
5. The primary cause of the bug is the mismatch between the expected input (string names) and the actual input (tuple of names).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle the case where the column locator (`clocs`) contains tuples of names instead of string names.
2. Modify the code to extract string names from tuples in `clocs` before attempting to get the level number.
3. Ensure that the index names are properly extracted from the tuple if present.
4. Adjust the code to work effectively with both single-level and multi-level index names.

### Correction to the Buggy Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    index_names = index.names  # Get the names of index levels
 
    clocs = [loc if isinstance(loc, str) else (loc[0] if isinstance(loc, tuple) else None) for loc in clocs]
    # Extract string names from tuples or take first string name from tuple if present

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains unchanged
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function as shown above, the function will be able to handle the extraction of string names from tuples or use the first element of a tuple as the name. This modification ensures compatibility with tuple input for column locators in MultiIndex DataFrames.
