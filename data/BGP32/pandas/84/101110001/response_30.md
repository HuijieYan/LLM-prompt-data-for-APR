### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function within the pandas module, specifically in the section where `index._get_level_number(i)` is called. The error arises from an attempt to access a level name that does not exist in the `MultiIndex`. This issue disrupts the unstacking operation of the DataFrame.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function, more precisely in the line where it attempts to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the `index._get_level_number(i)` method is trying to extract a level number based on a level name (`i`) that does not exist in the index. This mismatch leads to KeyError when attempting to find the level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level name exists before trying to retrieve its level number. This can be achieved by checking if the level name is present in the `index.names` list before querying its index.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else None for i in clocs]

    if None in clocs:
        raise KeyError("One or more specified levels not found in MultiIndex")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this adjustment, we check if each level name in `clocs` exists in the `MultiIndex` before getting its level number. If a level name does not exist, we raise a `KeyError` indicating that one or more specified levels were not found in the MultiIndex.
