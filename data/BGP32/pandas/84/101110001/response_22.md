### Analysis:
The `_get_level_number` method is being called in the `_unstack_multiple` function to retrieve the index level number based on the level name. The error indicates that the method is not able to find the specified level name in the list of names, leading to a `KeyError` or `ValueError`. This is causing the test cases to fail.

### Location of Error:
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
level = self.names.index(level)
```
inside the `_get_level_number` method, where the level name (`'A'`) is not found in the list of names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is that the `level` passed to `_get_level_number` is `'A'`, which is not a valid name in this context.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to correct the use of the level name being passed to the `_get_level_number` method. It seems like the level name is supposed to be a tuple containing the names of multiple index levels. We need to update the function to handle this correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `_unstack_multiple` Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs_numbers)):
                val = clocs_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle the level names correctly and pass the failing test cases.
