### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` in the MultiIndex class is raising an error due to a KeyError or ValueError, which leads to the failing of the test cases.
2. The `_unstack_multiple` function is trying to get the level number corresponding to each level name passed in `clocs` for the index. 
3. The error occurs when the name provided is not found in the list of names in the MultiIndex object.
4. The buggy function fails to handle multi-level index names properly when trying to unstack based on those levels.

### Bug:
The bug is in how the `_unstack_multiple` function is retrieving the level numbers for the index levels. When the function tries to get the level number for a given level name, it mistakenly handles the names as single strings instead of handling a tuple of strings (in case of MultiIndex levels with multiple levels).

### Fix:
Adjust the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly parse the level names for MultiIndexes with multiple levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the `if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0])` condition inside the list comprehension for `clocs`, we ensure that we correctly handle both single level names and tuple of levels for the MultiIndex object. This fix should address the issue with handling multi-level index names and allow the function to unstack based on those levels correctly.
