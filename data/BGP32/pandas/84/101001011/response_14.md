### Bug in the Buggy Function:

The bug arises due to an issue in determining the level numbers of the MultiIndex columns. The function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to fetch the level number, but it encounters a `KeyError` indicating that the specified level is not found. This results in the function crashing with an error, as seen in the provided GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:

The issue stems from the erroneous usage of tuple names when calling the `unstack` function, which leads to issues in processing the levels correctly in the `clocs` list. The code attempts to find the level numbers based on the specified tuple names, which fails due to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels with tuple keys.

### Fix Strategy:

1. Replace the tuple names in the `clocs` list with actual level names or numbers to prevent the KeyError during level number retrieval.
2. Adjust the code to handle MultiIndex columns appropriately when dealing with tuple names.
3. Ensure that the function works correctly with MultiIndex columns containing tuple keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with the necessary adjustments to handle MultiIndex columns properly:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        cloc_numbers = [index.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = clocs

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
    ...
```

By adjusting how level numbers are derived from the column names specified in `clocs`, the corrected function should be able to handle MultiIndex columns with both tuple names and regular level names correctly. This fix should address the `KeyError` and ensure that the function executes smoothly without crashing.
