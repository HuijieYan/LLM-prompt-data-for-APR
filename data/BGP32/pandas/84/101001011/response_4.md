### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs due to the way the function `_unstack_multiple` processes the input `clocs` (column locations) by trying to map the provided tuple names to actual level numbers. The issue arises from the way the `clocs` are processed in the function, where the `index._get_level_number(i)` call fails to find the level since the provided names are tuples and not single level names.

### Error Location:

The error originates from the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Bug Cause:

The cause of the bug is the mismatch between the expected single level names within the `clocs` list and the provided tuple names. The function assumes `i` to be single level names, leading to the `KeyError` when looking for tuples like `('A', 'a')`.

### Fix Strategy:

To resolve the issue, you need to handle the case where the `clocs` contain tuples representing MultiIndex names. You should extract the levels corresponding to these tuples and use them to refer to the correct level in the DataFrame's MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers based on the provided tuples
    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_names().index(i) for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This correction includes an additional check to handle the situation where the `clocs` contain tuples representing MultiIndex names. It extracts the corresponding level numbers based on the provided tuple names or level names directly from the MultiIndex's `names`. This adjustment allows the function to correctly identify the levels involved.
