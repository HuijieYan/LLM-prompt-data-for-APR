### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function in handling MultiIndex columns. The function is designed to unstack a DataFrame based on the specified column levels (`clocs`). The issue arises when the function encounters a tuple name for columns, causing a KeyError due to accessing levels incorrectly.

### Bug Location:
The issue is pinpointed in this line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The error occurs because the function expects integer levels but is receiving tuple names as column identifiers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of column levels to correctly extract the column levels based on the input criteria. We should consider that `clocs` might contain integer level numbers instead of tuple names.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

This modification ensures that if the column levels in `clocs` are tuples (names), it converts them to level numbers using `get_loc` rather than `_get_level_number`, addressing the KeyError issue.

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly unstack the DataFrame based on the specified conditions, resolving the reported bug.
