### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The specific issue arises from incorrectly handling the level names when iterating over the columns.

In the provided runtime values, the function is trying to extract the level numbers for 'A' and 'a', but it fails to find 'A' in the list of level names due to incorrectly handling tuple names in MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level names are extracted correctly from the MultiIndex columns. This involves handling single and multi-level column names appropriately to avoid the KeyError related to level names.

### Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_nums = [index.get_loc(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_nums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_nums]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_nums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_nums]

    # Rest of the function remains the same from here
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to extract level numbers correctly for both single and multi-level column names, we can address the KeyError caused by level names not being found. This fix ensures proper handling of level names in MultiIndex columns.
