### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the issue arises from the usage of `clocs` which is a tuple containing tuple values, causing a KeyError during the `_get_level_number` process. The error originates from trying to directly get the level number using a tuple like `('A', 'a')` as a single identifier, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the handling of `clocs` to ensure that it correctly identifies the levels from the MultiIndex. By iterating over the elements in `clocs` and extracting the level numbers for each element, we can avoid the KeyError and properly utilize the hierarchical column information for unstacking.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers using a nested list comprehension
    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(elem) for elem in clocs]

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining body of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By iterating over the elements in `clocs` and correctly obtaining the level numbers, we ensure that the unstacking operation will proceed without encountering a KeyError related to tuple identifiers. This correction addresses the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
