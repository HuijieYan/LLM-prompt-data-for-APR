### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking of MultiIndexed `DataFrame` objects in pandas. One problem in the function is that it doesn't deal with hierarchical columns properly. The function aims to rearrange the data based on the provided column locations (`clocs`) while preserving the original data structure.

### 2. Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the code tries to extract levels of the index in the `clocs` list, leading to an exception. The bug arises from the incorrect assumption that the levels in the `clocs` list directly correspond to integers, while in reality, they should match the names within the `MultiIndex`.

### 3. Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the assumption that the `clocs` list directly references the levels within the index using integers. This results in a mismatch between the level names in the index and the values within the `clocs` list. The error surfaces due to the key error when attempting to access the level number using the provided parameters.

### 4. Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to map the names in the `clocs` list to the respective level numbers in the `MultiIndex`. This ensures that proper handling of the hierarchical columns is achieved during the unstacking process.

### 5. Bug-Fixed Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function considering the mapping of level names to level numbers:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Map names in clocs to level numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

    ...
    # The rest of the logic remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the `clocs` list is now used correctly, mapping the names in the list to the respective level numbers in the `MultiIndex`. This adjustment ensures that level names are correctly identified for hierarchical unstacking.
