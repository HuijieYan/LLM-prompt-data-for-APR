### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way the function handles the input `clocs` tuple, which represents the target columns to be unstacked. The bug occurs due to the fact that the function uses `_get_level_number` method on the `index` object, trying to process the names in the `clocs` tuple as levels in the MultiIndex. Since the names in the `clocs` tuple are actually not individual levels of the MultiIndex but rather represent levels and labels collectively, this leads to a `KeyError` when trying to process 'A' in the example provided in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update how the `clocs` tuple is processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Instead of directly trying to get the level numbers from the names in the MultiIndex using `_get_level_number`, the function should process the tuple as representing specific levels and labels, and then work with those levels and labels to perform the unstacking operation correctly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = data.index.names
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = data.index.names

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.index.names[-1]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

By incorporating the corrections in processing the `clocs` tuple, the corrected version should now properly handle the unstacking operation on MultiIndexes with tuple names such as in the example provided in the GitHub issue.
