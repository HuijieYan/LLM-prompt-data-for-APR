### Bug Analysis:
Upon reviewing the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, we can identify potential error locations:
1. The function is failing to handle hierarchical columns properly.
2. The error seems to be related to the part of the code where it extracts level numbers using `_get_level_number`, possibly due to incorrect handling of the tuple names.
3. The bug is encountered when the function is called with a tuple of names like `("A", "a")` as the `level` argument, causing a `KeyError` due to the named tuple not being handled correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the function `_unstack_multiple` does not correctly handle named tuples passed as part of the `level` argument. The code attempts to extract level numbers from the passed named tuple, which results in a `KeyError` when the named tuple is not found in the index's names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to handle named tuples properly. Specifically, the function should be modified to correctly identify the level numbers when named tuples are passed as input.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with modifications to handle named tuples correctly:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a conditional check to ensure that if the element in `clocs` is a tuple, it extracts the level number using `_get_level_number`. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` issue related to passing named tuples as input.
