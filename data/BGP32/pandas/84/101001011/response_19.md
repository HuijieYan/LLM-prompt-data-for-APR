### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in level names passed to the `unstack` function within the `DataFrame` when trying to unstack a MultiIndex. The error arises as the code fails to properly identify the level numbers associated with the input level names causing a KeyError due to the incorrect level name 'A' being passed instead of level number.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, it is essential to correctly identify the level numbers associated with the given level names in the `clocs`. Providing the correct level numbers will ensure that the unstacking operation proceeds without any KeyError. Updating the code where the level numbers are derived based on the names provided should resolve this issue.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function considering the issue and the observed bug:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains as is
```

In this corrected version, the `clocs` list is modified to handle both level names and level numbers. By checking the type of the element in `clocs`, it ensures that level numbers are not processed again while allowing level names to be converted to level numbers when needed, resolving the KeyError issue. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior.
