### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack data based on specified column levels.
2. The function extracts information from the input data's multi-level index to perform unstacking operations.
3. The bug occurs when hierarchical columns are passed as input, leading to issues in handling the column levels.
4. The failing test cases demonstrate the issue by specifying multi-level column names for unstacking, which causes `KeyError` during execution.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem encountered when trying to unstack multi-level columns.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function's inability to handle hierarchical columns correctly. When processing multi-level columns, the code fails to determine the level numbers correctly, resulting in `KeyError` during the unstacking operation.
The function attempts to extract level numbers based on column names, which can lead to incorrect indexing in the presence of multi-level columns.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for extracting column levels properly. The function should identify multi-level columns and handle them appropriately to avoid `KeyError` and ensure successful unstacking.

### Fix for the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[-1])

    return unstacked
```

By correcting the logic for level number extraction and adjusting the unstacking mechanism, this updated version should address the reported bug and successfully unstack multi-level columns without causing `KeyError`.
