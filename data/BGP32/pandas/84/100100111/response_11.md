The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is primarily due to incorrect handling of multi-level index names. Specifically, the issue relates to the conversion of tuple names into level numbers, causing a `KeyError` as reported in the GitHub issue. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the tuple names are correctly mapped to level numbers. Also, the logic for creating new indices and columns should be adjusted to consider multi-level indices properly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should address the issue based on the provided test cases and the GitHub issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the MultiIndex object
    index = data.index

    # Map tuple names to level numbers correctly
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Determine the levels and codes based on clocs and rlocs
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        # No levels left for columns, use a standard Index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames

        new_codes = rcodes + [unstcols.codes[-1]]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

Ensure to test this corrected function against the provided test cases to verify if the bug has been successfully fixed. This version should handle multi-level index names correctly and prevent the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
