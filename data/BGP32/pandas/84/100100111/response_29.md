### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the `_get_level_number` function not handling the case where level names are tuples correctly. Specifically, the function expects a single level name (string) as input, not a tuple of level names. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access the level number of the tuple name.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple level names. We should adjust the code to extract the level numbers for each name in the tuple. Then, we can use these level numbers as intended in the subsequent parts of the function.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers for each level name in the tuple
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
}
```

With this modification, the function should now be able to process tuple level names correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring.
