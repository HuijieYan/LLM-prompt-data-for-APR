### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` aims to perform an unstack operation on a DataFrame with a multi-index. The bug arises from the handling of the `clocs` parameter, where the function expects a tuple but wrongly converts it into a list of integers representing the level numbers.

#### Error Location:
The key error arises from converting the tuple into integers (`clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`), which should not occur as it needs to handle multi-level column names.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the incorrect conversion of the tuple `clocs` into a list of integers, causing a KeyError when trying to access a level that does not exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function needs to properly deal with multi-level indexes in the columns. Instead of obtaining level numbers, the function should use the actual column names.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # rest of the function remains the same
}
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles multi-level column names using the actual column names instead of trying to convert them into integers.
