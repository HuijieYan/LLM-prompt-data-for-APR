### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails when provided with a tuple of column names as `clocs`. It tries to determine the level numbers based on the input column names, but it does not gather the level numbers correctly. This leads to erroneous indexing and causes the function to return incorrect results. The issue arises due to the way the function handles the input `clocs` tuple, particularly when mixed with multi-level column indices.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and correct the function `_unstack_multiple`, we need to change how it interprets the column level names when passed as a tuple. The correct processing of the tuple should extract the level numbers accurately. This fix will ensure the function operates as intended, especially when dealing with multi-level column indices.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers from the index based on column names
    clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(name) for name in clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs

    # Other parts of the function remain the same as before
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining implementation remains unchanged
```

This corrected version now correctly determines the level numbers based on the column names when passed as a tuple, ensuring the function operates correctly in scenarios involving multi-level column indices.
