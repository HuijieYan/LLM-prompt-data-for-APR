### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex and tuple names. The issue arises from the _unstack_multiple function failing to handle the case where clocs is a tuple. This causes an error in extracting the level numbers.
2. The buggy function _unstack_multiple attempts to extract the level numbers from the index based on the clocs parameter, which can be a tuple or a single value. However, the function does not correctly handle tuple values when processing level numbers.
3. The bug causes the KeyError 'Level A not found' when trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex having tuple names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in _unstack_multiple to correctly extract level numbers in the case of tuple values in clocs. Additionally, we need to ensure that both single values and tuple values are handled appropriately to avoid the KeyError.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    # Handle tuples in clocs
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same

    # Return the unstacked DataFrame
    return unstacked
```

By modifying the function to handle tuples in clocs properly, the KeyError issue should be resolved, and the function should work correctly for unstacking DataFrames with MultiIndex and tuple names.
