### Bug analysis
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when attempting to unstack a DataFrame with multiindexed columns. The issue arises from the handling of the `clocs` parameter, which represents the column levels to be unstacked.

The bug has been identified in the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The issue is about unstacking a Series or DataFrame with multiindexed columns using tuple names, encountering a KeyError in `_get_level_number`.

### Bug location
The bug seems to be originating from the misinterpretation of how column levels are handled when unstacking multiindexed DataFrame columns.

### Bug cause
The cause of the bug lies in the way the function processes the column levels. When multiple column levels are present, the function fails to correctly access the levels by number due to the usage of a tuple parameter in `clocs`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To resolve the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to correctly identify and process the column levels specified in `clocs`. It needs to handle multiindexed columns appropriately to avoid the KeyError encountered when trying to access levels by name.

### Corrected function
Here, I provide a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the integer levels based on the passed tuple clocs
    cloc_numbers = [data.columns.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Remaining code unchanged
``` 

This corrected version of the function directly indexes `clocs` to obtain the integer levels instead of trying to use the levels directly. This modification should prevent the KeyError issue when attempting to identify the level numbers from column names.
