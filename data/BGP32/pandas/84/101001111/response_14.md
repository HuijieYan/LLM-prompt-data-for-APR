## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way it handles the variable `clocs` when dealing with MultiIndex objects. The buggy function attempts to extract the level numbers from the provided `clocs`, which in some cases doesn't handle hierarchical columns properly, leading to a KeyError or ValueError.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles hierarchical columns correctly and extracts the level numbers appropriately. We should modify the code to correctly identify the level numbers based on the MultiIndex object provided in the `data.index` variable. It is crucial to account for the possible nested levels and correctly extract the level numbers for both single and multi-level indices.

## Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the provided bug explanation and the expected input/output values:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_idx = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc = tuple([level if isinstance(level, str) else level[0] for level in loc])
        clevel_idx.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_idx]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_idx]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_idx]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_idx]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # The remaining logic remains unchanged from the original function

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should appropriately handle hierarchical columns and extract level numbers to perform the unstack operation without causing KeyError or ValueError.
