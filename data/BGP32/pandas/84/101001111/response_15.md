### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `clocs` variable. The function transforms the provided `clocs` tuples into a list of level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method of the index. However, when passing tuples as `clocs`, it fails to correctly extract the level numbers from the index.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section of code where the `clocs` are being converted to level numbers:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The issue stems from the fact that the `_get_level_number` method is expecting single-level names, causing it to fail when receiving tuples like `('A', 'a')`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, rather than directly extracting level numbers from the index using `_get_level_number`, we should convert the provided tuple names into corresponding level names by iterating through the index levels and matching the names.

### Code Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cnames = []
    for loc in clocs:
        for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
            if name == loc:
                cnames.append(name)
                break

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in cnames]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    # Return the unstacked DataFrame
    return unstacked
```

This revised code correctly matches the provided tuple names with the index names to extract the corresponding level numbers before proceeding with the unstacking operation.
