### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to incorrect processing of the input parameters `clocs`. The buggy function attempts to retrieve the level number for each element in `clocs` using the `index._get_level_number(i)` function, leading to the `KeyError` when the level is provided as a tuple (for MultiIndex). This issue results in the incorrect unstacking of the DataFrame when multiple hierarchical columns are involved.

### Bug Location
The bug lies in the improper handling of the input variable `clocs` in the function `_unstack_multiple`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the `clocs` input contains the indices of the levels to unstack, but the function fails to handle the case when hierarchical column names are provided as tuples. This leads to encountering a `KeyError` due to the incorrect conversion of the column location information.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the way `clocs` is processed to handle both single-level and multi-level column unstacking properly.
2. Update the code to differentiate between single level and multi-level columns to ensure the correct unstacking of the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Update to handle hierarchical column names as tuples
    if not isinstance(clocs[0], (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The remaining code remains the same...
```

By incorporating the modifications above, the function should correctly handle both single and multi-level column unstacking, resolving the issue related to unstacking with tuple names in hierarchical columns.
