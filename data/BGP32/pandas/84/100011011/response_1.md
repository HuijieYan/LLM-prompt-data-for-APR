### Bug Analysis:
- The error message indicates a KeyError caused by the `Level A not found` in the case of MultiIndex unstack with tuple names `(A, a)`.
- The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` which fails due to the incorrect way it tries to extract level numbers.
- The function extracts the level number by calling `_get_level_number` method on the MultiIndex, but the issue arises when tuple names are passed as levels. Since there is no direct match, it tries to index the level by name leading to the error.

### Bug Location:
- The issue occurs when the function tries to retrieve level numbers from the index by directly calling `_get_level_number` without handling tuple names in clocs properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the level numbers are extracted when tuple names are provided. We should check if the level is a tuple and extract the level number accordingly.

### Correction and Updated Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            if all(isinstance(l, str) for l in level):
                return tuple(index.names.index(l) for l in level)
            else:
                raise ValueError("All elements in the tuple should be strings")
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(level)

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        ...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        ...
    else:
        ...
    
    return unstacked
```

By modifying the `get_level_number` function to handle tuple names appropriately, we ensure that the correct level numbers are extracted for unstacking. This fix will address the issue with KeyError in MultiIndex unstack with tuple names.
