### Bug Analysis and Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in the way levels are passed and handled in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The error message indicates that `level = 'A'` which is causing the issue. The function expects an integer level number, but it receives a tuple `('A', 'a')` instead.

The list comprehension `[index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` attempts to get the level number for each item in `clocs` where `clocs` is given as tuple (`(('A', 'a'), 'B')`). This leads to the error since it should be an integer, not a tuple representing MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect handling of levels in the function. The function should correctly deal with the MultiIndex levels passed as tuples and extract the integer levels from them.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers for MultiIndex levels
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modification in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]` to handle the case where `i` is a tuple (MultiIndex) and extracts the level number from the tuple. This way, the function can correctly process MultiIndex levels and avoid the key error.
