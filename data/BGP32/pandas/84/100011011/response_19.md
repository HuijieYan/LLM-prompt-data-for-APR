### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to an issue with handling tuple names in MultiIndex columns. When trying to unstack using tuple names like `('A', 'a')`, the function fails to correctly identify the levels and raises a `KeyError` or `ValueError` in the `_get_level_number` method.

The problematic part is during the transformation of tuple names to level numbers in the `clocs` list. The error arises from the incorrect processing of Tuple as input rather than a Regular string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to handle tuple names correctly by extracting the individual levels of the tuple and converting them to level numbers.
2. Update the code to check if the input is a tuple and split it into individual levels.
3. Make sure to handle both single and tuple name unstack operations appropriately.


### Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    clocs_new = []
    for c in clocs:
        if isinstance(c, tuple):
            clocs_new.extend([index._get_level_number(l) for l in c])
        else:
            clocs_new.append(index._get_level_number(c))

    clocs = clocs_new

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    ...

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By using this corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function, the issue with unstacking MultiIndex columns with tuple names should be resolved. The function will now accurately handle both single and tuple names for unstacking.
