### Bug Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class. When unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex that has levels defined with tuples, the function fails to correctly handle the tuple-based names. This results in an error that 'A' is not in the list in the MultiIndex class, leading to a KeyError.

#### Issues Identified:
1. The handling of tuple-based names, specifically in the `_get_level_number` method, is causing the ValueError and subsequent KeyError.
2. The processing of MultiIndexes with tuple-based names is failing to correctly identify the levels based on the tuples in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the levels are handled when processing MultiIndexes. Specifically, when the levels are defined using tuples, the code should correctly recognize the tuples as hierarchical levels. By adjusting the `_get_level_number` method and the related sections of the function, we can address the issue and resolve the KeyError.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function
Based on the identified issues and bug analysis, the buggy function can be corrected in the following way:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By including a check for tuple-based names in the `clocs` list and ensuring proper handling of MultiIndexes with tuple-based names throughout the function, we can address the bug and resolve the KeyError issue encountered during unstacking operations involving MultiIndexes with tuple-based names.
