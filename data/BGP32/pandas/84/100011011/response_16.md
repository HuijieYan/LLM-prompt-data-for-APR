### Bug analysis:
The bug occurs when calling the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex index. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found, leading to a KeyError. The issue seems to stem from how the level names are passed and handled within the function.

### Error cause:
The issue arises because the input `clocs` is passed as a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`. The function expects integers as level numbers, but `clocs` contains tuples of level names. These level names need to be properly converted to the corresponding level numbers before proceeding.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle converting level names to level numbers correctly.
2. Ensure that the proper transformation is applied to the input `clocs` before using them to get new levels for the unstacked DataFrame.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert level names to level numbers
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_loc(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This correction ensures that the `clocs` list contains the correct level numbers necessary for further processing in the function.
