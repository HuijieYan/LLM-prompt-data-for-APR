### Analysis:
1. **Error Location:**
   - The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method within the `MultiIndex` class, which is being called from the `_unstack_multiple` function.
   - The issue is originating from the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

2. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug leads to an error due to passing a tuple of MultiIndex levels as `clocs` to the function, which the function does not handle correctly.
   - The function expects the `clocs` parameter to contain integer values representing the levels of the index.

3. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuples containing MultiIndex levels properly.
   - When a tuple is passed, resolve the MultiIndex levels to corresponding integer values and continue processing.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_int = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Resolve MultiIndex levels to integers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_int]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_int]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_int]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_int]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    # Remaining code remains the same.
```

By implementing this change, the function will now correctly handle the case where a tuple of MultiIndex levels is passed as `clocs`. The fix resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug by allowing the `_unstack_multiple` function to operate correctly with MultiIndex levels in tuple form.
