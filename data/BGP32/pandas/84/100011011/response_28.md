### Bug Analysis

The bug occurs due to an issue with handling tuple names in MultiIndex when unstacking. The function `_get_level_number` is unable to handle tuple names correctly, resulting in a KeyError and ValueError. This bug appears when unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex that contains tuple names like `('A', 'a')` and 'B'. The code tries to extract the level number based on the given level, but it fails due to mismatched formats.

### Bug Location

The bug is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class within the `pandas.core.indexes.multi.py` file.

### Bug Cause

The cause of the bug lies in the way the function tries to extract the level number using the `index._get_level_number(i)` call. Since the level format doesn't match single-level index expectations, it raises errors resulting in a failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the levels are processed, mainly handling tuple names correctly during unstacking with MultiIndex.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        clocs = [clocs]
    else:
        if not isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
            clocs = [(clocs,)]
        
    clocs = [(index.names.index(name), level) for name, level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [cloc[0] for cloc in clocs]]

    shape = [len(index.levels[cloc[0]]) for cloc in clocs]
    group_index = get_group_index([index.codes[cloc[0]] for cloc in clocs], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [index.codes[cloc[0]] for cloc in clocs], xnull=False)

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=[index.levels[rloc] for rloc in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
        codes=[index.codes[rloc] for rloc in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
        names=[index.names[rloc] for rloc in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.copy()
        unstacked.index = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

Make sure to place the corrected function in the appropriate file location in the pandas library for it to take effect. This version of the function should handle the tuple names correctly during the unstacking process, resolving the key and value errors observed in the failing test cases.
