### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error related to retrieving the level number from the MultiIndex. The error messages indicate that the function is unable to find the specified level.
2. The issue arises when the function tries to determine the level number for a given level, causing a KeyError due to the level not being found.
3. The function attempts to iterate over the `clocs` (column locations) parameter, which contains tuples specifying the levels of the MultiIndex. It then tries to get the level number for each level in `clocs`, resulting in the KeyError error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the level numbers are extracted from the MultiIndex to ensure that the specified levels can be correctly identified.
  
### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append([index._get_level_number(ln) for ln in cloc])
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This fix corrects how the function handles getting the level numbers for both single levels and tuples of levels.

By using the corrected version above, the function should be able to determine the appropriate level numbers for unstacking multiple levels correctly as required by the failing test.
