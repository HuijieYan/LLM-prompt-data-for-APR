### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is trying to access a level that is not found in the MultiIndex, resulting in a `KeyError`. This is due to the way the function handles the `clocs` parameter, specifically in trying to extract level numbers from a tuple of names.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the provided buggy function, the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is expecting the values in `clocs` to be level names, but it needs to handle tuple names properly.
2. The error occurs when trying to extract the level number of the element `'A'` from the tuple `('A', 'a')`. Since 'A' is a tuple, the function raises a ValueError, which is then handled into a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Modify the way the function handles extraction of level numbers for `clocs` by checking whether an element in `clocs` is a tuple or not before processing it.
2. If the element is a tuple, extract and operate with the constituent names appropriately.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

Applying this fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported on GitHub.
