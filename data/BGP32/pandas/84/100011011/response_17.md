### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Messages

1. The `'_get_level_number'` method in the `MultiIndex` class is throwing a `KeyError` when trying to access a level that is not found in the list of names. This occurs during the unstack operation on a DataFrame with a MultiIndex.
   
2. The error message reports that the specified level `'A'` (or in the second case, `'B'`) is not found in the list of names. This implies that there is an issue with how the levels are accessed or handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

3. The input `clocs` are tuple names (like `('A', 'a')`) which should be converted into level numbers inside the function. However, due to incorrect handling of the levels inside the function, the KeyError is raised.

### Potential Bug Locations

1. The bug might be occurring in the section where the `clocs` are converted into level numbers since the KeyError related to level not found.
   
2. The exception handling for identifying the level number might not be correctly implemented, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Cause

The bug is caused by an incorrect conversion of tuple names to level numbers in the `_get_level_number` method of `MultiIndex`. The method is unable to find the names provided as input in the list of names, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug:
1. Correctly identify the level numbers based on the tuple names provided.
2. Handle the conversion from names to numbers properly to avoid the KeyError.
3. Update the logic to correctly extract the level numbers for a MultiIndex with tuple names.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
  
    return unstacked
```

The fix involves checking if the provided input for level is a tuple, and if so, converting it into the corresponding level number using the `_get_level_number` method. This correction should address the KeyError raised due to level names not being found in the list of names.
