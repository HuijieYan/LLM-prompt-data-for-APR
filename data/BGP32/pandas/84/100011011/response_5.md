### Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring due to an error when the function `_get_level_number` is trying to find a level that does not exist in the `names` list of the `MultiIndex`. This is leading to a `KeyError` in the function `_get_level_number` when it attempts to locate 'A' in the `names` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Since the error seems to be related to the handling of level names in `MultiIndex`, the fix should involve ensuring that the function properly handles level names when they are passed as part of a tuple. It seems that the issue stems from the function expecting individual level names instead of a tuple containing multiple level names.

### Updated Function
Here is an updated version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_level_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            temp = []
            for loc in cloc:
                temp.append(index._get_level_number(loc))
            cloc_level_numbers.append(tuple(temp))
        else:
            cloc_level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This fix involves checking if the value in `clocs` is a tuple and then extracting individual level names from the tuple to find the corresponding level number. This modified approach should handle tuple names correctly.

Please replace the buggy function with this corrected version and re-run the failing tests to confirm that the bug is fixed. Let me know if you need further assistance!
