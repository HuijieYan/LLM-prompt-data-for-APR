### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` works on unstacking multi-index columns. The error occurs when trying to find the level number based on the input `clocs`, which are tuple names in the multi-index.
2. The cause of the error is in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where it tries to find the level number of the column. It fails to find the level since the names are tuples.
3. The error message indicates that it could not find the level `'A'` in the list of names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `clocs` are tuple names correctly by first checking if the name exists in the index and then finding the corresponding level number.

### Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By checking if the name exists in the index before using `_get_level_number`, we prevent the KeyError from being raised. This fix ensures that the function can handle input tuple names correctly.
