### Bug Analysis:
The bug is caused by passing a tuple of names `(A, a)` as the `level` parameter in the `unstack` method, which leads to an error in the `_get_level_number` method when trying to index the level name directly. This issue stems from the way the `level` parameter is being processed within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Bug Location:
The cause of the bug lies in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
Here, `i` is a tuple, causing the error when trying to index the level directly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `clocs` parameter is expected to be a list of integer levels, but it is a tuple of names in the failing tests. The `_get_level_number` function cannot directly handle tuple names leading to a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`.

### Solution:
To fix this issue, we need to convert the passed tuple of names (like `('A', 'a')`) into the corresponding level numbers before calling `_get_level_number`. We should extract the level numbers based on the names in the tuple.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index.names.index(name) for name in clocs]  # Extract level numbers from names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By correctly extracting the level numbers based on the names passed as a tuple, we can avoid the previous errors and implement the unstack operation successfully.
