## Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking operations, especially for hierarchical columns.
- In the failing tests, there are MultiIndex structures with multiple levels involved in unstacking operations.
- The bug occurs when trying to get level numbers from the index but fails to find a level with the provided name.
- The error message indicates that the function is trying to find a level via its name and fails because the name is not present.

### Issue:
The bug in the function is caused by assuming all levels are single strings when extracting level numbers from the index. This assumption breaks when dealing with MultiIndex structures containing tuples of names at different levels.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the function to handle nested tuples appropriately when extracting level numbers.
- Modify the part of the code that is responsible for getting level numbers to account for MultiIndex with nested tuples as names.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Update this line

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = []
    ccodes = []
    cnames = []
    rlevels = []
    rcodes = []
    rnames = []

    shape = [len(index.levels[i]) for i in clocs]
    group_index = get_group_index(index.codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, index.codes, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i, val in enumerate(clocs):
                result = result.unstack(index.levels[val], fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        unstcols = unstacked.columns if isinstance(unstacked, DataFrame) else unstacked.index
        new_levels = [stcols.levels[0] for stcols in unstcols] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
        new_codes = [stcols.codes[0] for stcols in unstcols]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By fixing the code snippet that handles the extraction of level numbers from the MultiIndex structure, the function is now able to deal with the provided test cases involving MultiIndex structures with nested tuples as names.
