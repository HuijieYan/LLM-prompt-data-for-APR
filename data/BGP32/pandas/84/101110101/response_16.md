### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `clocs` when it is a tuple of level names. The function expects `clocs` to be a list of levels that need to be unstacked. However, when `clocs` is a tuple containing multiple levels, the function does not handle these levels correctly, resulting in the ValueError due to the incorrect handling of level names in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to check if `clocs` is a tuple and handle multiple levels correctly.
2. Identify the correct level numbers for each level in the `clocs` tuple.
3. Ensure that the unstacking is performed correctly for the specified levels.

### Updated/Copied Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making these adjustments, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle the cases where `clocs` is a tuple of multiple level names, ensuring that the unstacking operation is performed without any errors as previously encountered.
