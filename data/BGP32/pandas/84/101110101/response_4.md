## Analyzing the buggy function

The `_unstack_multiple` function aims to unstack multiple levels of a DataFrame index. However, it fails to correctly handle the input for multi-index columns. The bug seems to arise during the process of extracting and manipulating level numbers from the column locations provided.

The reported error messages indicate that the function encounters a `ValueError` due to an attempt to access a level name that does not exist in the column index of the DataFrame.

## Bug Explanation

The primary issue is highlighted in the following line of code:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The function `_get_level_number`, called for each element in `clocs`, tries to retrieve the level number based on the level name provided. However, the function `_get_level_number` doesn't support multi-index column names, leading to the error where the level name `'A'` is not found in the list of names.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle multi-index column names correctly. We can achieve this by introducing an additional check to handle multi-index column names appropriately, allowing the function to work seamlessly with the provided input.

## Bug Fix and Updated Function

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With these updates, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle multi-index columns correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
