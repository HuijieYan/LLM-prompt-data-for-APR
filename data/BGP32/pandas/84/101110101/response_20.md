### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking multiple levels of columns in a DataFrame. It processes the data based on the provided columns (`clocs`) to unstack them from columns to the index.
2. The bug arises when attempting to convert the column location identifiers (`clocs`) to their respective numeric representation in the index. The buggy line has an issue with identifying the level numbers correctly.
3. The error message indicates a failure in finding the level name 'A', which suggests an issue with identifying the correct column level number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we correctly identify the level number associated with each column and select the relevant information based on that.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the code to correctly identify the level number associated with each column name using the `level` parameter.
2. Update the logic to fetch the correct information based on the identified level numbers and perform unstacking accordingly.
3. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the correct transformation of data structure while unstacking multiple levels of columns based on the provided location identifiers.

### Solution
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Correctly identify the level numbers associated with column names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By correctly identifying the level numbers and adjusting the selection of information based on those numbers, the corrected function should now be able to unstack multiple levels of columns as expected.
