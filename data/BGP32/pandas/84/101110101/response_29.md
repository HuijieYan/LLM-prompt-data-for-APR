### Bug Fix
The bug is caused by the `clocs` variable being a tuple that contains a tuple in certain cases, which is not being handled correctly in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The `index._get_level_number(i)` function expects a single level name. In the failing cases, it is trying to extract the level numbers from a tuple of level names which results in an error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `clocs` parameter is processed within the `_unstack_multiple` function, ensuring that it handles the cases where `clocs` is a tuple with multi-level names correctly.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            for sub_loc in loc:
                new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(sub_loc))
        else:
            new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    clocs = new_clocs

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
}
```

This corrected version processes the `clocs` parameter correctly, handling both single-level names and tuples of level names. It extracts the level numbers for all the level names in the provided tuple.

After implementing this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should work correctly with the failing test cases provided.
