### Analysis:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the assumption that the input parameter `clocs` is a single level position, but in the failing tests, it is a tuple representing multiple levels. This leads to errors in the code when trying to access the levels' positions based on the assumption of a single level position.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
where `clocs` is expected to be a single level, but in the failing tests, it is a tuple `(level1, level2, ...)`, causing the assumption of a single level to fail. This leads to an error when trying to index the levels.

### Fix:
Modify the way the `clocs` variable is handled by checking its type and looping over it if it is a tuple, accessing multiple levels instead of a single one, thus fixing the error.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

With this fix, the function will be able to handle single-level or multi-level input correctly and avoid the error encountered in the failing tests.
