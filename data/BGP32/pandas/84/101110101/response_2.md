## Buggy Function Explanation

The _unstack_multiple function is designed to unstack a multi-index DataFrame based on specified levels. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes errors when trying to retrieve the level number of the specified levels.

The bug arises from the fact that the clocs parameter passed to the function should be a list of levels to unstack. Still, in the current implementation, the function attempts to directly get the level number of the tuple objects in clocs, which is not valid for the MultiIndex class.

Additionally, the function fails to handle Nested Named Tuples correctly when passing clocs as a tuple of tuples.

## Bug Fixing Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the function handles the clocs input parameter. Instead of trying to get the level number directly from the MultiIndex object, we should extract the level numbers corresponding to the clocs levels correctly.

## Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from clocs
    index = data.index
    levels = index.levels
    codes = index.codes
    names = index.names

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_number = tuple(list(index._get_level_number(level) for level in cloc))
        else:
            cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(len(levels)) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By fixing the way clocs are handled within the function, we ensure that the correct level numbers are extracted, enabling the function to unstack the multi-index DataFrame successfully for both single and nested levels.
