## Code Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is designed to handle multi-index unstacking operations in pandas. It fails when the `clocs` parameter is passed a tuple instead of a list of column locations.

The issue arises from how the `clocs` variable is treated. It is assumed to be a list of column locations, but in the failing test cases, it is passed as a tuple.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` parameter is always converted to a list before further processing. This way, the function will be able to handle both single or multiple column locations correctly.

## Bug Fix - Updated Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that properly handles the `clocs` parameter:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert clocs to list if it's not already

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # No further changes needed
```

By converting `clocs` to a list if it's not already one at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the function can process both single and multiple column locations correctly.

This fix should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
