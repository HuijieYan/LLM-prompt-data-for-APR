## Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is designed to handle unstacking operations on multi-level DataFrames with certain constraints. However, the function is failing to correctly process hierarchical columns for certain scenarios, resulting in key errors and value errors. The root cause of the issue stems from how the levels and codes of the MultiIndex are being handled within the function.

1. In the buggy function, the processing of `clocs` is problematic, which causes errors when trying to unstack for certain multi-level index setups.
2. The logic for reconstructing the columns after unstacking is not handling the multi-level column setup properly when the data is a DataFrame.

## Bug Identification
The bug arises from erroneous processing of the `clocs` (columns locations) variable and incorrect handling of reconstructing columns after unstacking in the presence of multi-level column indices.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the way `clocs` are processed and ensure that multi-level columns are reconstructed properly after unstacking. Specifically, attention needs to be given to how levels and codes are extracted and reassigned during unstacking.

## Bug Fix and Updated Implementation
I will provide a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index
    index = data.index

    # Extract levels and codes for columns
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Drop the selected levels from the index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Verify if the data is a Series
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        if isinstance(dummy.columns, MultiIndex):
            dummy.columns = dummy.columns.droplevel(clocs)

    dummy.index = dummy.index.droplevel(clocs)

    # Unstack the dummy DataFrame
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    if not isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        new_levels = rlevels + [index.levels[clocs[0]]]
        new_names = rnames + [cnames]
        new_codes = rcodes + [ccodes[0]]
    
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )

        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should address the issues related to multi-level index handling during the unstacking process. It includes proper extraction and reassignment of levels and codes, ensuring the correct setup of the columns after unstacking. The revised implementation aims to pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
