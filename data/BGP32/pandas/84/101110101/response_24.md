## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations on data with multiple indices. However, the function is failing due to an issue with how it processes column levels and names, leading to errors when accessing level numbers and setting up the new columns.

Here are the identified issues causing the bugs:
1. At the beginning of the function, the code did not handle hierarchical column levels properly. The function is designed to unstack multiple indices, but the existing code does not cover this scenario.
   
2. When processing column levels and names, some operations such as fetching level numbers (`_get_level_number`) and creating new column MultiIndex were incorrect due to improper handling or conversion of level names.

## Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bugs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to adjust how hierarchical column levels are processed and ensure that the column names and levels handling is correct. Specifically, updating the handling of hierarchical columns during the unstacking operation should resolve the issues causing the failures.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.get_level_codes(i) for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.get_level_codes(i) for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        dummy_index = Index(range(len(index)), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [index.remove_unused_levels()], 
                                 codes=rcodes + [index.remove_unused_level_codes()],
                                 names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"], 
                                 verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = list(unstacked.columns.codes)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(levels="__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [None] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]]
        new_codes.extend([rec[-1] for rec in ccodes])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should now handle hierarchical columns correctly and resolve the issues causing the failing tests.

After applying the fix, re-run the failing test cases provided to verify the correctness of the updated function.
