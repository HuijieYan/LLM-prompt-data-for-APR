## Analysis:
- The `unstack` function is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function.
- The bug occurs when the `level` parameter is a tuple of names within a MultiIndex and is expected to be expanded into multiple columns.
- The issue arises when trying to convert the tuple names into level indices within the MultiIndex.
- The error occurs because the function `_get_level_number` doesn't handle tuple names and only works with simpler level names or integers.
- The failing test cases involve MultiIndex with tuple names causing the error when expanding them during unstacking.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names by checking for the existence of the tuple within the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex.
- Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly detect when a tuple name is provided as `level` and handle the unstacking operation appropriately.
- Adjust the index level identification logic to work with tuple names as well.

## Implementation of the Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        if level in self.names:
            return self.names.index(level)
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Ensure tuple input is converted to a list
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the `_get_level_number` and `_unstack_multiple` functions as described above, the bug causing the KeyError when unstacking tuple names should be resolved, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
