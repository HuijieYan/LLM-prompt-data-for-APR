### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` encounters a `ValueError` because `'A'` is not found in the list of names. This issue is causing the subsequent `KeyError` to be raised in the test function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it tries to find the level number of a given label. The error arises because it mistakenly uses a tuple `(A, a)` as the level name instead of a single string. This causes the function to look for `'A'` as a single name instead of the tuple `(A, a)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, the function needs to handle tuples correctly when extracting the level number. It should check for tuples and extract the components of the tuple properly before finding the index. This update will ensure that the level is correctly identified when dealing with multi-level indexes.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(index, level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level_names = [index.names.index(name) for name in level]
        else:
            level_names = [index.names.index(level)]
        return level_names

    clocs = [get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    # Rest of the function follows...
```

By making the modifications to correctly handle tuples as level names in the `get_level_number` function, the bug causing the ValueError and KeyError should be resolved.
