### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method when trying to determine the index of a specific level. The error messages indicate that the level name provided is not found in the list of level names.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the attempt to retrieve the index of a level that does not exist in the list of level names. This results in a `KeyError` or `ValueError` when trying to process the unstacking operation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the level name is present in the list of level names before attempting to retrieve its index.
2. Avoid attempting to unstack a non-existent level to prevent errors.

### Fixed Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if i in index.names]

    if not clocs:
        raise ValueError("Level name not found in index names")
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly handle the situation where the level name is not found in the list of level names. This should prevent the `KeyError` and `ValueError` from occurring during the unstacking operation.
