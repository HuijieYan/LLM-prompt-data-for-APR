### Analysis:
1. The error messages indicate that there are exceptions occurring during the execution of the `_get_level_number` function inside the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file.
2. The error messages specifically mention `KeyError` and `ValueError` for different scenarios related to the levels in MultiIndex objects.
3. The root cause of the issue seems to be related to handling the levels correctly and identifying the correct levels in the `clocs` list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of level names and indices in the MultiIndex object.
1. The function is trying to get the level number using `_get_level_number` method for each element in the list `clocs`.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to search for the level name in the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex but does not find it due to incorrect format or not being in the correct structure.
3. This leads to `KeyError` or `ValueError` depending on whether the specific level name is not found or is not in the correct type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the levels are correctly identified and processed in the `_get_level_number` method. The `clocs` list needs to be handled properly before accessing the level number.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making the above adjustment to how levels are accessed in the `clocs` list, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct levels are identified in the MultiIndex object. This should resolve the `KeyError` and `ValueError` issues reported in the error messages.
