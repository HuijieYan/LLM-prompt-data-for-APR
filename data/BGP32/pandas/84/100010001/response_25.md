### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the `_get_level_number` method is throwing either a KeyError or ValueError related to the level name not being found in a list. This issue is directly related to how the level name is being handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It seems like the issue arises when the level being passed is a tuple instead of a simple string, causing the method to try and check for the exact tuple object in the list of names, which results in an error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` method expects a simple string level name, but it receives a tuple due to how the levels are passed into the function. This leads to a KeyError or ValueError when the name lookup is performed.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the level names are passed and handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. Check if the level argument is a tuple. If it is a tuple, extract the first element which is the actual required string level name.
2. Handle the extracted string level name appropriately to avoid errors related to key or value not found.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract string level name from tuple if needed
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs[0]]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By extracting the string level name from a tuple if necessary, we ensure that the `_get_level_number` method receives the correct input and avoids the KeyError or ValueError that was occurring.
