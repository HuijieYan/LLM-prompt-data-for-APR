### Analysis
The `KeyError` and `ValueError` errors are occurring because the function `_get_level_number` is trying to find a level name within a MultiIndex, but the input is given as a tuple containing multiple names. This is causing the errors as the function is expecting a single name.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `clocs` parameter passed to the function `_unstack_multiple` is being processed in a way that expects single level names to be present in the `clocs` list. However, in the failing test cases, the levels are represented as tuples (for example, `('A', 'a')`), which triggers errors when trying to find these tuples as level names within the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function and the way the `clocs` parameter is processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. We should handle tuples as level names in the MultiIndex when trying to get the level number.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = list(level)
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        if not is_integer(level):
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    return level

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

This corrected version of the function handles tuple names correctly and should pass the failing tests.
