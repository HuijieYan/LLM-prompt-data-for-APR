The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to the way it handles columns with hierarchical indexes. The main issue arises from how the function is handling the level names when unstacking the data.

1. The error messages indicate a KeyError and ValueError due to the function trying to index or find a level that doesn't exist in the index names.

2. The problematic section of the code is the conversion of level names to level numbers `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This part of the code is causing the function to encounter errors when dealing with multi-level indexes.

3. The cause of the bug is related to how the level names are processed within the function when unstacking the data. If the level names are not in the correct format or if the function is unable to find a specific level, it results in errors such as KeyError or ValueError.

4. To fix the bug, a strategy would be to refactor the code that deals with converting level names into level numbers. This can involve checking if the level names are formatted correctly and ensuring that the function can handle multi-level indexes appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now checks if the level is a tuple before converting it to a level number. This allows the function to handle both single-level and multi-level indexes correctly.
- This modification ensures that the function can handle multi-level indexes without encountering errors related to level names.
