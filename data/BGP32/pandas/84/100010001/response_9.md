The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing with the error message KeyError: 'Level A not found'. The issue arises when trying to get the level number for a column that is not found in the MultiIndex names.

From the function `_unstack_multiple`, the problematic line is:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The error message indicates that 'A' (or 'A' as part of a tuple) is not found in the list of names of the MultiIndex columns. This causes the function to raise a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we are passing the correct column levels to the `_get_level_number` function. The error suggests that 'A' level is not present in the MultiIndex, so we need to modify how we are passing the column levels to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if i in index.names]  # Check if i is present in index.names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    ...
```

By checking if the column level is present in the names of the MultiIndex, we avoid trying to get the level number for non-existent columns, which resolves the KeyError issue. This modification ensures that only valid column levels are used in the unstacking operation.
