### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is unable to find the specified level (`'A'`) within the names of the MultiIndex used. This error is triggered when trying to unstack a DataFrame using a tuple that includes non-existent level names.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function assumes that the input argument `i` (level name) provided for `_get_level_number` exists within the names of the index. In the failing test cases, the level names are specified as tuples (`('A', 'a')`) which are not found directly as individual strings in the MultiIndex names.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to accurately handle multi-level names that are specified in tuples. We need to check if the provided `level` is a tuple, and if so, search for the entire tuple within the MultiIndex names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def _get_level_number(level) -> int:
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
                if all(n in name for n in level):
                    return i
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        else:
            count = index.names.count(level)
            if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
                raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
            try:
                return index.names.index(level)
            except ValueError:
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [_get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

By updating the `_get_level_number` function to handle both single names and tuples as level references, we can make the unstacking process work correctly for multi-level names. This fix will allow the correction of the bug and the passing of the failing tests.
