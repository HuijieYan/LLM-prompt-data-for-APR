The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way it handles retrieving the level number from a MultiIndex. The error messages indicate that there are issues when trying to find the level number for a given level name in the MultiIndex object.

The problematic line is:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The error occurs when it tries to access a level that does not exist in the MultiIndex names.

To fix this issue:
1. We need to extract the level name properly from the input `i` in `clocs`.
2. If the level name exists in the MultiIndex names, get the corresponding level number.
3. If the name does not exist, raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By using `index.names.index(i)` instead of `index._get_level_number(i)`, we can correctly find the index of the level name in the MultiIndex. This modification will prevent the KeyError or ValueError exceptions from being raised and resolve the issue with obtaining the level number based on the level name.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
