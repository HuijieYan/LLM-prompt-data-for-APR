### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack multi-level indexes in a DataFrame. The error arises when trying to identify the level number for a given level name (`A`, `B`, etc.) in the MultiIndex. The error message indicates a `ValueError` or a `KeyError` depending on the scenario.

### Issues:
1. The `level` parameter provided to identify the level number is sometimes a tuple and sometimes a single string, which is leading to the errors.
2. The error handling in `_get_level_number` is incorrect, as it should raise a KeyError when the level is not found.

### Suggestions for Fixing:
1. Convert the `level` parameter to a single string for consistent handling.
2. Update the error message to raise a KeyError if the level is not found in the MultiIndex names.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]  # Ensure level input is a string

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the level identifier regardless of whether it is passed as a tuple or a single string and raise a KeyError if the level is not found. This should resolve the error messages encountered in the failing tests.
