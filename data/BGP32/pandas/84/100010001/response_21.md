### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering errors related to the function `_get_level_number`, which is used to retrieve the level number of a given level in the index. The errors thrown are either `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` or `KeyError: 'Level A not found`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to passing the tuple of level names `( "A", "a" )` directly as the `level` argument in the `unstack` method. The function expects to receive a single level name, but when passing a tuple of level names, it triggers an error in the `_get_level_number` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `level` argument passed to the `_unstack_multiple` function is processed correctly. If it is a tuple of level names, we need to extract the individual level names and handle them accordingly. We should modify the code to handle the case where the `level` argument is a tuple.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By this correction, we handle the case where the `level` argument is a tuple by extracting the individual level names from it before calling `_get_level_number`. This fix should address the errors encountered in the failing tests.
