### Analysis:
The `ValueError` and `KeyError` occurring in the `_get_level_number` method are due to the fact that the function is attempting to find the index of a level name that does not exist in the `MultiIndex.names` attribute. This is causing the exceptions to be raised and the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_level_number` method to handle the case where the level name doesn't exist.
2. Handle the case where the level name in `clocs` may not be present in the `MultiIndex.names`.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_level_number(level) -> int:
    if not isinstance(self.names[0], tuple):
        level = (level,)
        
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    return level


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # The remaining code remains unchanged

```

By making the above changes, the bug causing the ValueError and KeyError will be fixed, and the function should now handle the scenario where the level name might not exist in the MultiIndex.
