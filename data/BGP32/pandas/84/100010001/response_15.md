### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method within the `MultiIndex` class. The error message indicates that it cannot find the specified level in the list of names within the MultiIndex. This error is caused by passing a tuple `('A', 'a')` as the level instead of a single level name.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the failing test, the function `df.unstack(('A', 'a'))` is called with a tuple `('A', 'a')` as the level parameter instead of a single level name. The function `_get_level_number` expects a single level name, so it raises an error as it can't find the tuple in the list of names.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_get_level_number` method can handle a tuple parameter by checking if the level is a tuple and converting it to a single level name in such cases.

### Updated Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_single_level_name(level):
        return level[0] if isinstance(level, tuple) else level

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(get_single_level_name(i)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...

```

By adding the `get_single_level_name` function and modifying the line that calls `_get_level_number`, we can handle both single level names and tuples as level parameters. This approach resolves the issue and ensures the function works correctly.
