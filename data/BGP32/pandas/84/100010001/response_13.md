### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class, specifically when trying to get the index of a level that does not exist in the `names` attribute. This error is triggered due to incorrect handling of the input level names during the unstacking process in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `clocs` (column locations) are being processed. The error arises from the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
where `i` represents level names from `clocs` list, and these level names should correspond to existing levels in the `index` object.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the level names provided in the `clocs` list are not directly matching the level names present in the `index` object, and therefore, the `_get_level_number` method of MultiIndex raises an error when trying to find the index of a non-existent level name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the code to handle the case where the level names in the `clocs` list do not exactly match the level names present in the `index` object. We should modify the code to ensure that we are using the actual level positions or numbers instead of level names when processing the `clocs` list.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels + [Index(data.columns)],
            codes=index.codes + [list(range(data.shape[1]))],
            names=index.names + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version directly uses the level positions or numbers from the `index` object to construct the `dummy_index`. Additionally, this version handles the case where only the column levels are stacked and not the row levels. The code should now be able to correctly perform the unstacking operation without raising errors related to level names.
