## Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to an incorrect handling of multiple levels in the index when trying to get the level number. The buggy function is designed to unstack a DataFrame with hierarchical columns but fails to handle this specific case properly.

The function `_unstack_multiple` encounters an issue when extracting the level number for the columns being unstacked. It expects a single level but receives a tuple of levels, causing it to raise a `ValueError` or `KeyError`.

The problematic code is within the lines where `clocs` are transformed into level numbers:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The function is not equipped to handle tuples as input in `clocs`, leading to the error.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the case when multiple levels are passed as a tuple in `clocs`. We should extract the level numbers for each level in `clocs` separately.

## Bug Fix
Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if not isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.extend([index._get_level_number(loc) for loc in cloc])

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    ...
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case of a tuple of levels in `clocs` and extract the level numbers for each level in the tuple separately. Now the function should be able to handle hierarchical columns without raising errors.
