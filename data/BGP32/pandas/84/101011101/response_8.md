### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the way the `index._get_level_number(i)` method is used within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The issue is due to differences in how the levels are accessed in single-level and multi-level indices.

In the failing test cases, the input `clocs` is being passed as a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which represents two levels. However, in the buggy code, the `_get_level_number` method is not handling multi-level indices correctly. This results in errors when trying to access levels based on a tuple index.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the levels are accessed from the MultiIndex. Specifically, when processing `clocs` with multiple levels, we need to handle it appropriately.

### Updated Function Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    cidx = index.remove_unused_levels()
    ridx = index.reorder_levels(rlocs + clocs)

    group_index = get_group_index(cidx.codes, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, cidx.levshape, cidx.codes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(ridx.labels + [obs_ids], names=rnames + ['__placeholder__'])

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = [cidx.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

### Result
With this corrected version of the function, the errors related to multi-level indices should be successfully resolved, and the function should now handle `clocs` with multiple levels appropriately, passing the failing test cases.
