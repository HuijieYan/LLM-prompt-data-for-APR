### Bug Analysis
The bug is caused by the way the `clocs` variable is processed in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The function expects `clocs` to be a list of level names, but in the failing tests, it is a tuple of level names. This leads to an error when the function tries to extract the level number using `_get_level_number`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to convert the tuple `clocs` into a list of level names before processing it in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert tuple to list of level names
    clocs = list(clocs)
    
    # Rest of the original function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By converting `clocs` to a list, the function will process the input correctly and avoid the error encountered in the failing tests.
