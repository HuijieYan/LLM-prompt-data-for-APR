### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the `clocs` variable is passed as a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` to the `_unstack_multiple` function. However, the function assumes that `clocs` is a list of tuples representing level names, which causes an error when trying to access the index level names due to the mismatch in the data types.

The error message indicates a problem with accessing the level names: `'A' is not in list`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple with a single tuple element. We should convert the tuple `clocs` into a list with one element before further processing.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # Please insert the remaining code here
```

By converting the `clocs` variable into a list if it is a tuple with a single tuple element, we can ensure that it is consistent with the expected input data type. This correction should resolve the issue of access level names and allow the function to execute correctly for the failing test cases.
