## Bug Analysis
- The error occurs when the `_unstack_multiple` function tries to process and unstack the data based on provided column and index locations.
- The error message indicates that the name 'A' is not found in the list of index names, causing a KeyError.
- The function incorrectly processes the input tuple clocs, resulting in mismatched index levels and names.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
- Since the error is related to the index lookup based on provided names, we need to ensure the correct handling of tuple names for hierarchical indexing.
- Ensure the appropriate adjustment of levels, codes, and names based on the extracted locations to avoid missing levels for processing.
- Adjust the function logic to correctly process input columns and index locations for both single and multiple levels.

## Bug-Free Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the column and index levels from the provided locations
    col_level, col_name = clocs[0]
    rloc_name = [name for name in data.index.names if name not in clocs]

    cloc_num = data.index._get_level_number(col_level)
    rloc_num = [data.index._get_level_number(name) for name in rloc_name]

    clevel = data.index.levels[cloc_num]
    rlevel = [data.index.levels[num] for num in rloc_num]

    ccode = data.index.codes[cloc_num]
    rcode = [data.index.codes[num] for num in rloc_num]

    # Unstack based on extracted column and index information
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy.index.droplevel(col_level)
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(col_name, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Recreate new MultiIndex for unstacked data
    new_columns = unstacked.columns
    new_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.index, names=rloc_name + [col_name])

    unstacked.index = new_index

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version of the function:
- The input tuple `clocs` is correctly processed to extract the column level and name.
- Then, the function successfully unstacks the DataFrame using the extracted column label and creates a new MultiIndex based on the remaining levels.
- This corrected version should address the KeyError issue and correctly unstack the data based on provided hierarchical index and column names.
