The main issue causing the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to the extraction of levels and indices from the `clocs` input. The bug originated from the assumption that `clocs` consists of tuples representing MultiIndex levels. To fix this bug, we need to handle different cases depending on the input type of `clocs`.

1. If `clocs` is a string representing the level name:
   - Extract the level number using `obj.index._get_level_number(clocs)` instead of directly using `index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs`.

2. If `clocs` is a tuple representing the MultiIndex levels:
   - Extract the level numbers using `obj.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and all(isinstance(i, str) for i in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    elif isinstance(clocs, tuple) and all(isinstance(i, tuple) for i in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle different input types for `clocs` and pass the failing test cases by extracting the appropriate level numbers or handling multi-level cases accordingly.
