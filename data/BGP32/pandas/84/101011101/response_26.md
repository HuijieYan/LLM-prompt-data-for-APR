## Bug Fix

### Bug Reason:
The bug is due to the incorrect handling and extraction of levels in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is failing when trying to extract level numbers from the provided column locations.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct level numbers are extracted from the column locations. We should modify the way we access the level name in the provided column location tuple. We should also make sure that we handle the case where the level name is nested within another tuple.

### Updated Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level names from the clocs
    clocs = [c[0] if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining implementation remains the same

    return unstacked
```

By applying the fix above, the function should now correctly handle extracting the level numbers from the column locations, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
