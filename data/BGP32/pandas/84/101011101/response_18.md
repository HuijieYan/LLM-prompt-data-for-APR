The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the incorrect handling of the levels and naming during the unstacking process. The function is unable to properly unstack data when dealing with multiple levels of columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for unstacking and reconstructing the columns correctly. Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get index and column information
    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns

    # Extract the level numbers from clocs
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Determine remaining column levels
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Perform unstacking operations
    result = data
    for val in reversed(clocs):
        result = result.unstack(level=val, fill_value=fill_value)

    if isinstance(result.columns, MultiIndex):
        new_columns = result.columns
    else:
        # Reconstruct the columns with proper levels and names
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            result.columns, names=[None] + [result.columns.names[0]]
        )

    result.columns = new_columns

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the unstacking process works correctly for multiple levels of columns. Make sure to include the necessary imports and verify the function using the failing test cases to ensure it works as expected.
