## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to handling the parameter `clocs` incorrectly when it is a tuple. The function is assuming a single level name is passed in the tuple and trying to extract it as a single value, resulting in errors when accessing the index. To fix this bug, the function needs to handle tuple input for `clocs` as a multi-level index.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes the `clocs` parameter when it is a tuple. We should treat it as a multi-level index instead of extracting a single level name. Let's update the code accordingly:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        # Convert tuple to a list of level names
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

In the updated code:
- We check if `clocs` is a tuple, and if it is, we convert it into a list of level names.
- We proceed with processing the levels of the MultiIndex as before.

This adjustment should fix the bug in the function. Now the function should be able to handle both single-level and multi-level index input correctly.
