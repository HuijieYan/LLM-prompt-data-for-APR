## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically when trying to get the level number of the columns in the MultiIndex and handling it. The issue leads to incorrectly indexing the levels and codes of the MultiIndex, causing downstream errors in the unstacking process.

1. In the failing test cases, the error message indicates a KeyError when trying to find the level 'A' in the list of names in a MultiIndex.
2. The runtime values show incorrect variable values right before returning from the function, which leads to the test failures.
3. The buggy function has issues with correctly assigning new levels, names, and codes when reconstructing the index after an unstack operation.
4. The issue lies in improperly handling the indices and column levels in the MultiIndex, likely due to the code not accounting for the correct number of levels and codes during unstacking.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the levels and codes are handled during the unstacking operation. The corrected version should accurately reconstruct the MultiIndex after unstacking the data, considering all the levels, names, and codes correctly.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By applying these changes, we addressed the incorrect handling of levels and codes, ensuring a proper reconstruction of the MultiIndex after unstacking. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
