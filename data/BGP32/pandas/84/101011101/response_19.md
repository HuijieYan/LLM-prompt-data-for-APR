### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the function `_unstack_multiple` when trying to get the level number from the column locations (`clocs`). The function incorrectly assumes that the column locations (`clocs`) directly correspond to the level names of the index (`index.names`). This assumption leads to a mismatch and results in the error messages (`ValueError` and `KeyError`) during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the column locations (`clocs`) are tuple-like values that need to be matched properly with the MultiIndex levels. We should extract the correct level names that correspond to the given column locations to avoid the `ValueError` and `KeyError` issues.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = []
    for loc in clocs:
        # Extract level name from the column location
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_name = loc[0]
        else:
            level_name = loc

        # Find the correct level index in the MultiIndex
        level_idx = index.names.index(level_name)
        clevels.append(index.levels[level_idx])

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clevels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # remaining code unchanged...
```

By incorporating the fix, we correctly extract the level name corresponding to the column location, prevent the function from raising errors when determining the level numbers, and ensure a correct execution flow.
