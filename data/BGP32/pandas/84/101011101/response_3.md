### Analysis
The bug seems to be due to the way the `clocs` variable is handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is trying to extract the level number from the MultiIndex based on the provided labels in `clocs`. However, the current implementation fails to handle the case where `clocs` contains tuples of labels.

### Bug Explanation
1. When `clocs` contains a tuple of labels, the function tries to convert these labels to level numbers using `_get_level_number` method.
2. The `_get_level_number` method expects the labels to be single strings, not tuples.
3. This results in an error when the `_get_level_number` method is called with a tuple label, causing a KeyError or ValueError.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `clocs` contains tuples of labels. We can modify the function to extract the level numbers correctly, even when provided with tuples.

### Code Fix
I'll provide the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs_modified = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):  # Check if the label is a tuple
            # Convert the label tuple to a single string representation
            clocs_modified.append((index.names.index(loc),))
        else:
            clocs_modified.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_modified]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This modification ensures that even if `clocs` contains tuples of labels, they are appropriately converted to their corresponding level numbers to avoid the KeyError or ValueError. The function should now work correctly with both single labels and tuple labels.
