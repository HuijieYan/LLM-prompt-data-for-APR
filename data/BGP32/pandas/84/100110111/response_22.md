### Bug Analysis
The bug arises in the `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas` library when trying to perform `unstack` operation on a DataFrame with MultiIndex that has tuple names like `("A", "a")`. The function is unable to handle tuple names and raises a `KeyError` because it expects the `level` to be an integer or a single element from the tuple names. 

### Bug Location
The buggy behavior occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when it attempts to extract the level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`, passing in tuple names as the `level`. This function is not designed to handle tuple names, leading to the subsequent error.

### Bug Explanation
The core issue is that the `_unstack_multiple` function was not designed to work with tuple names in the MultiIndex. As a result, passing tuple names to the function causes an error in extracting the level numbers, leading to a `KeyError` or a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names. This can be achieved by adapting the level extraction logic to handle tuple names appropriately and ensure that the function does not fail when tuple names are provided.

### The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify levels based on name or integer
    index = data.index

    levels = index.names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) if not isinstance(level, tuple) else levels.index(level) for level in clocs]
   
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # Ensure the code below is retained as is

    # Previous code in the function
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...
```

This correction introduces a change in how the level numbers are extracted. It now handles both integer levels and tuple names properly, preventing the `KeyError` or `ValueError` from occurring and ensuring the function can process MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly.

Applying this fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
