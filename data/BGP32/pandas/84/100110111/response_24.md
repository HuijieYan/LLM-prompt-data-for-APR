### Explanation of the Bug

The Bug is caused by the function `_get_level_number` in the `MultiIndex` class. The input provided to `_get_level_number` in the `clocs` list is a tuple `("A", "a")`. The issue is that the `_get_level_number` function is expecting a string value instead of a tuple, leading to the error `'A' is not in list`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should correctly handle input values that are tuples specified with MultiIndex names, ensuring that the appropriate level numbers are retrieved based on the tuple names of the MultiIndex. The fix involves refactoring and adapting the section of code that uses `_get_level_number` to handle tuples with MultiIndex names correctly.

### Code Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = []
    clevel_names = []
    for clevel in clocs:
        # Check if level is a tuple
        if isinstance(clevel, tuple):
            level_names = [index.name for index in clevel]
            level_numbers = index._get_level_number(level_names)
            cloc_levels.extend(level_numbers)
            clevel_names.extend(level_names)
        else:
            cloc_levels.append(index._get_level_number(clevel))
            clevel_names.append(clevel)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Continue with the rest of the function...

```

This revised version of the function includes a logic to handle tuples in `clocs` and retrieve level numbers appropriately for MultiIndex names. It avoids passing tuples directly to `_get_level_number`, which was causing the KeyError. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
