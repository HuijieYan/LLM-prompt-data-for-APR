## Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails due to an error in retrieving the level number from the index. The issue arises in cases where the column locations parameter includes tuple names that are part of a MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the level number.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the way the function `_unstack_multiple` processes the column locations provided as input. When tuple names are involved, the function attempts to retrieve the level number directly from the index without considering the MultiIndex structure properly. This leads to the KeyError when the level name is not found in the list of names.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the way the function processes the column locations in cases where tuple names are involved. The fix should properly handle MultiIndex structures to extract the correct level number based on the tuple names provided.

## Correction
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This correction includes an updated comprehension for `clocs` to check if the input is a tuple and then acquire the level number based on the tuple elements. This modification ensures that the function can handle MultiIndex structures correctly, particularly when tuple names are involved.
