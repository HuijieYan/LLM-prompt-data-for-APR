The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from how the function handles hierarchical columns when unstacking a DataFrame with MultiIndex. The function fails to properly handle tuple names in MultiIndex columns, leading to a KeyError during execution.

### Bug Analysis:
- The function retrieves the level number for each specified column label, i.e., tuple name, in the `clocs` list.
- The issue arises when trying to fetch the level number for tuple names like `('A', 'a')`, as the function expects a single level name but encounters a tuple name format.
- This issue leads to a ValueError followed by a KeyError as the function fails to find such a level within the MultiIndex names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the function handles tuple names within MultiIndex columns. Instead of considering tuple names as single level entries, we should process them correctly to extract the individual levels within the tuple. This way, we can get the correct level numbers for the columns, enabling successful unstacking of the DataFrame.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # The function should handle hierarchical columns with tuple names correctly

    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            for level in loc:
                new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(level))
        else:
            new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in new_clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in new_clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in new_clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same as the original function

```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle tuple labels within MultiIndex columns and avoid the KeyError encountered during unstacking. This fix aligns with the expected behavior of correctly identifying and processing hierarchical columns during unstacking operations.
