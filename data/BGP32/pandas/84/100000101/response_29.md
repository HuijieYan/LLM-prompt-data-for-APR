The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` arises from incorrect indexing manipulation, leading to reshaping issues. To fix this bug, we need to ensure correct calculations for reshaping the dataframe according to the specified column levels.

The buggy function tries to unstack a DataFrame based on the provided column indexes `clocs`. It first identifies the rows and columns indexes to be unstacked, reconstructs the data structure based on the reshaping, and ultimately sets the new column index.

To correct the bug, we need to adjust the assignment and reshaping steps within the function. The DataFrame should be unstacked correctly according to the provided column levels to match the expected outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        return data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            [(col[0], *col[1]) for col in unstacked.columns]
        )
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
        
        return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should now appropriately unstack the DataFrame based on the specified column levels and produce the expected outputs for all provided test cases.
