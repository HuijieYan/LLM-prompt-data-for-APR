## Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `MultiIndex` column naming in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When selecting columns for unstacking with a tuple as the column index, the function is not properly identifying the target column levels. This results in errors when trying to extract the level number of the target column.

### Issues
1. The level selection logic is flawed, leading to incorrect identification of target column levels.
2. The function is not handling the `MultiIndex` column structure appropriately, causing errors during unstacking.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the level selection process and adjust the handling of `MultiIndex` columns during unstacking. Specifically, we need to correctly identify the target column levels and apply the unstacking operation in a way that aligns with the hierarchical column structure.

Let's implement the necessary corrections in the `_unstack_multiple` function to address the issues identified above.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract the names of levels from the clocs tuple
    cnames = [level[0] if isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [unstcols.names[-1]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[-1]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By making the adjustments as shown in the corrected version of the function above, the issues identified in the buggy function should be resolved, and the provided failing tests should pass successfully.
