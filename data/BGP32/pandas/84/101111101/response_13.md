## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to reshape the data by unstacking multiple levels. However, the bug arises when handling cases where a tuple of names is passed as the `clocs` parameter, resulting in the failure of the test cases provided above. The bug occurs due to how the function handles the conversion of a tuple of names to the corresponding level numbers in the index.

## Bug Explanation
1. The function attempts to extract the level numbers corresponding to the provided names in the `index` object.
2. When processing a tuple of names as the `clocs` parameter, the function tries to directly convert them to level numbers, which leads to an error because the function `_get_level_number` in the `MultiIndex` class expects individual names as arguments, not tuples of names.
3. This causes the function to raise a `ValueError` or a `KeyError` depending on the context, indicating that the given name is not found in the list of names.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the level numbers are extracted from the names when `clocs` is a tuple. We should iterate over each name in the tuple and convert it to its corresponding level number in the index.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]  # Change here

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Remaining code stays the same

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

By iterating over each name in the `clocs` tuple and converting it to the corresponding level number using `index.get_level_number`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles unstacking based on the provided names.
