## Bug Analysis
In the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the issue arises in the logic where the function tries to extract the level number from the input `clocs` parameter. The buggy line is:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The problem is related to the use of `clocs` as an iterable for level extraction, which doesn't handle well the case where `clocs` consists of tuples. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the single element or tuple provided in `clocs` depending on the type it holds. If it's a single element, we can directly extract the level number; for a tuple, we need to recursively extract the level numbers for each element in the tuple.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(entry):
        if isinstance(entry, tuple):
            return tuple(index._get_level_number(e) for e in entry)
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(entry)

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

The corrected version of the function will now correctly handle both single elements and tuples within the `clocs` parameter for extracting level numbers.

By using this corrected function, the related failing tests should pass as expected.
