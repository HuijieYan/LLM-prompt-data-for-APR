## Bug Analysis
In the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the issue arises from the way `clocs` are processed. The code attempts to get the level number corresponding to each label in `clocs` using `index._get_level_number(i)`. However, the function `_get_level_number` implemented in the `validate_levels` method of `MultiIndex` raises a `ValueError` when the label is not found in the list of level names.

In both failing test cases, the `clocs` variable contains labels that are tuples `(Tuple[str, str])` (e.g., `('A', 'a')`) rather than individual level names. This inconsistency causes the `ValueError` when trying to extract the level number without handling tuples properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how `clocs` are processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Instead of directly using the labels, we should iterate over the tuples in `clocs` and handle them appropriately. We should extract the level number corresponding to each element of the tuple and use that to obtain the necessary information for unstacking.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers from the tuple labels in clocs
    clevels = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            clevels.append(data.index._get_level_number(loc))
        else:
            clevels.append(data.index._get_level_number((loc,)))
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By modifying the code to extract the level numbers correctly for tuple labels, we ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function can handle multi-level index labels and process them appropriately. This fix addresses the `ValueError` that occurs due to mismatched label handling.
