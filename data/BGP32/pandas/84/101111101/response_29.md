## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to the `_get_level_number` function being called with a tuple as an argument when it expects a string. This error triggers a `ValueError` or `KeyError` while trying to convert the tuple into an index within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` parameter is processed correctly before passing it on to `_get_level_number`. We need to handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple and extract the relevant value for processing.

## Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Wrap the single tuple clocs into a list

    clocs_numbered = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_value = index._get_level_number(cloc[0])  # Extract the relevant value from the tuple
        else:
            cloc_value = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        clocs_numbered.append(cloc_value)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_numbered]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_numbered]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_numbered]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_numbered]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

By updating the function to correctly handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple, we prevent the ValueError or KeyError from occurring, thus fixing the bug.
