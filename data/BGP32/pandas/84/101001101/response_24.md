### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack multi-level columns in a DataFrame. However, there are issues with how it handles the input parameters `clocs` and the logic to determine the new columns and index.

In Case 1, when `clocs` is `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, the function is trying to unstack the DataFrame based on these levels. However, the processing of the levels, creation of a new index, and assigning data to the new index and columns are incorrect.

The main issues include:
1. Incorrect handling of `clocs` and the associated levels (clevels, ccodes, cnames).
2. Incorrect creation of the new index based on the processed levels.
3. Incorrect transformation of the DataFrame to match the new index and columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. Correctly determine the processing of `clocs` to get the correct levels and associated codes.
2. Generate a new index that correctly represents the unstacked DataFrame.
3. Ensure that the data from the original DataFrame is correctly assigned to the new index and columns.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Process clocs to get level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Define the new index based on unstacking
    new_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=[index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
        codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
        names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ['__placeholder__'],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    # Prepare the data for unstacking
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = new_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = new_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with processing levels, creating the new index, and assigning data to the unstacked DataFrame. It should now work correctly for the provided test cases.
