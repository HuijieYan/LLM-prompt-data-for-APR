The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling when `rlocs` is empty, resulting in an incorrect construction of the `dummy_index`. This causes issues when attempting to unstack the data later on.

**Bug Cause:**
- In the case where `rlocs` is empty, the function constructs a `dummy_index` with `obs_ids` and without any additional levels, leading to a wrong structure.
- Due to this incorrect structure, the unstacking operation does not yield the expected output.

**Fix Strategy:**
- Check if `rlocs` is empty at the beginning and construct the `dummy_index` appropriately based on this condition.
- Adjust the subsequent operations to handle the different scenarios based on the presence or absence of `rlocs` to ensure correct unstacking.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    if rlocs == []:
        # Construct a dummy index with obs_ids only
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
        
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
       # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version ensures that the `dummy_index` is constructed correctly based on the presence or absence of `rlocs`, allowing for the subsequent unstacking operations to produce the expected output.
