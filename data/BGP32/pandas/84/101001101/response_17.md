The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of the column indices and levels during the unstacking process. The issue stems from not properly updating the column levels and codes after the unstack operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column levels, names, and codes are calculated correctly based on the desired unstacking behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy().unstack(clocs)
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy().unstack(clocs)

    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product([dummy.columns.levels[0]] + clevels, names=[None] + cnames)

    if isinstance(dummy, Series):
        dummy.index = new_columns
    else:
        dummy.columns = new_columns

    return dummy
```

This corrected version ensures that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for both Series and DataFrames, with the column levels and codes being updated appropriately to reflect the unstacked data.

Make sure to test the corrected function with various scenarios to ensure its correctness and completeness.
