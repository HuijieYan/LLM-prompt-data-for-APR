The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrectly calculating the `rlocs` variable, which leads to an issue in handling hierarchical column data.

1. Analysis:
   - The function is intended to unstack a DataFrame based on hierarchical columns.
   - The bug occurs due to incorrect calculation of `rlocs` and subsequent manipulation of the column data.
   - The calculation of `rlocs` is supposed to find the indices of levels that are not included in `clocs`.

2. Bug:
   - The bug arises in handling the calculation of `rlocs` based on hierarchical columns.
   - When `rlocs` is not correctly determined, it affects the structure and organization of the unstacked data.

3. Bug Cause:
   - The incorrect calculation of `rlocs` leads to incorrect handling of the hierarchical columns, thus producing unexpected results in unstacking the data.

4. Fix Strategy:
   - Adjust the calculation of `rlocs` to correctly determine the indices of levels not included in `clocs`.
   - Ensure that the hierarchical structure of the columns is maintained during unstacking.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify levels not in clocs for correct unstacking
    index = data.index
    all_levels = set(range(index.nlevels))
    rlocs = list(all_levels - set([index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]))

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

By correctly determining the indices of levels not included in `clocs`, the function will be able to unstack the DataFrame based on hierarchical columns without introducing unexpected issues.
