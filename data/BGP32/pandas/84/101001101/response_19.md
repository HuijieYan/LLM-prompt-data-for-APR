The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to the incorrect handling of multiple levels in the column axis of the input DataFrame. The buggy function fails to correctly unstack the data when there are multiple levels in the columns. 

The bug is primarily due to the incorrect iteration over the column levels in the DataFrame. The function fails to properly unstack the columns when there are multiple levels present. Additionally, the reindexing logic and the reconstruction of the codes are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to revise how the columns are handled, especially when dealing with MultiIndex columns. We should iterate over the levels of the MultiIndex columns correctly and reconstruct the codes accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index of the data
    index = data.index

    # Get the number of levels in the index
    nlevels = index.nlevels

    # Get the number of levels in the columns MultiIndex if present
    ncollevels = 1 if isinstance(data.columns, Index) else data.columns.nlevels

    if ncollevels > 1:
        # Unstack the columns MultiIndex
        dummy = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Convert the single-level column Index to a MultiIndex for further processing
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples([(col,) for col in data.columns])

    # Perform unstacking based on the specified column levels
    for col_loc in clocs:
        dummy = dummy.unstack(level=col_loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return dummy
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the DataFrame has multiple levels in the columns. If it does, we directly unstack the columns. Otherwise, we convert the single-level column Index to a MultiIndex format for consistent processing.

Next, we correctly iterate over the specified column levels for unstacking. This ensures that the unstacking operation is performed accurately, considering the multiple levels in the columns.

The function now properly handles MultiIndex columns and unstacks the data based on the specified column levels.

Please test this corrected version with your input data to verify that it functions as expected and resolves the issue with unstacking MultiIndex columns.
