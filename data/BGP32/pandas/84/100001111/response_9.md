### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to the way the `clocs` parameter is handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function expects the `clocs` parameter to be a tuple of columns. However, the function mistakenly converts this tuple to a list of integers, assuming it to be level numbers.

### Bug Location
The primary issue lies in the conversion of the column names to levels within the `clocs` list.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of column locations. The function incorrectly assumes the input parameter `clocs` to be a list of level numbers instead of column names. This leads to errors when trying to extract the level numbers from the index, as the level names are in a tuple form.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix involves changing how the `clocs` parameter is interpreted within the function. Instead of directly treating `clocs` as level numbers, we need to extract the level numbers based on the column names provided in the input tuple.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that correctly extracts the levels based on the column names provided in the `clocs` tuple:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the level numbers corresponding to the column names in clocs
    clevels = [data.index._get_level_number(level_name) for level_name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    # Rest of the function remains the same.
    # No changes required beyond the clocs extraction part.

    # All other existing code as it is
    
    return unstacked
```

This correction ensures that the function properly understands the column names and extracts the corresponding level numbers from the index. With this fix, the function should now work correctly and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub link.
