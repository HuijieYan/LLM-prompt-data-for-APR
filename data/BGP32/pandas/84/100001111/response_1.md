### Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack multiple levels from a DataFrame if the `len(clocs) != 0`. It starts by extracting information from the input data index and then proceeding to manipulate the data based on the provided `clocs`. The issue arises when trying to convert the tuple `clocs` to a list of level numbers based on the index.

### Error Location
The error occurs when trying to extract the level numbers from the index using the tuple `clocs`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to get the level number based on the string values contained in the tuple for the column location.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should check the type of the input `clocs` to ensure it is a tuple since it is expected to be a tuple of column levels. Then, extract the level numbers for the specific columns needed for unstacking.

### Buggy Function Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = [index.get_loc(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        raise ValueError("clocs should be a tuple of column levels")
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

The updated code snippet checks if `clocs` is a tuple, and then extracts the level numbers based on the levels provided in the tuple. This adjustment allows the function to handle the multiple column unstacking operation without triggering a KeyError for missing levels.
