### Analysis:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking operations for MultiIndex data structures.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the level names during unstacking.
3. The function fails to correctly determine the level number for the given level names, resulting in KeyError during unstacking.
4. The issue stems from the incorrect interpretation of level names as integers rather than tuples.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that the level names are already level numbers, leading to an incorrect index access. When the function tries to retrieve the level number based on the level name, it fails because it doesn't handle tuples as level names properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for translating level names to level numbers. The adjustment should include correctly handling tuples as level names and extracting the corresponding level numbers accordingly.

### Updated Corrected Version of `_unstack_multiple` Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Update handling of hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [list(data.index.names).index(level_name) for level_name in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [data.index.names.index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version tackles the issue of determining the level number correctly, especially when the level names are tuples. Now, the function should be able to properly unstack the data with tuple names as indices, resolving the KeyError that was previously encountered.

This fix aligns the function's behavior with the expectations identified from the reported GitHub issue.
