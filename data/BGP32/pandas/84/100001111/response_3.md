### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a multi-indexed DataFrame but encounters issues with multi-level columns.
2. There is a problem with identifying the levels correctly, notably when dealing with multi-level column names.
3. The bug leads to errors in identifying the proper columns to unstack, resulting in unexpected behavior rather than correctly reshaping the DataFrame.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address how the function handles multi-level column indexes.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from how the function works with multi-level column indexes. When trying to unstack columns, the function encounters difficulties with multi-level column names such as ('A', 'a'). This issue leads to incorrect level identification and causes an error with the key 'A'.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, we should modify the handling of multi-level column indexes within the function. It is crucial to ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes multi-level columns for unstacking.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Updated to correctly handle multi-level column indexes
    columns = data.columns

    if isinstance(columns, MultiIndex):
        clevels = [columns.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [columns.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [columns.names[i] for i in clocs]
    else:
        clevels = [columns]
        ccodes = [columns.codes]
        cnames = [columns.name]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By updating the function to properly handle multi-level column indexes, the corrected version should now be able to unstack the DataFrame without encountering errors related to column level identification.
