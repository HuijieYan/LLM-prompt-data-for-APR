### Analysis:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking operations for MultiIndexed data.
2. The bug occurs when there are hierarchical columns involved in the unstacking operation.
3. The bug is causing issues when attempting to reconstruct the MultiIndex with the correct levels, names, and codes.

### Bug Description:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns during unstacking. The function fails to properly reconstruct the MultiIndex after unstacking when there are multiple levels involved.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update how the `rlocs` are determined based on the levels.
2. Ensure that the reconstruction of the MultiIndex is done correctly considering the hierarchical columns.
3. Handle the cases where both Series and DataFrames are involved appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Determine the correct levels to unstack
    clocs = [data.index.names.index(loc) if loc in data.index.names else data.columns.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]

    # Determine the remaining levels (rows)
    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    shape = [len(data.index.levels[loc]) for loc in clocs]

    # Perform unstacking
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Reconstruct the MultiIndex based on unstacked data
    new_levels = [data.index.levels[loc] for loc in clocs]
    new_names = [data.index.names[loc] for loc in clocs]

    # Handle the case of a Series
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        new_codes = data.index.codes
    else:
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function properly handles the reconstruction of the MultiIndex based on the unstacked data, considering the hierarchical columns. This should resolve the KeyError that was occurring in the unstacking operation with tuple names.
