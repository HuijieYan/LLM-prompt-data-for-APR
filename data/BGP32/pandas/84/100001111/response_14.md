### Bug Analysis
The bug is likely in the way the `clocs` variable is handled. It is supposed to contain the level names to unstack in the MultiIndex. However, it is converted to level numbers for the `rlocs` list, which influences further processing. The bug causes issues with correct unstacking when dealing with MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Explanation
The function `_unstack_multiple` mistakenly converts the level names in `clocs` to level numbers, leading to errors in handling hierarchical column MultiIndexes. This results in a KeyError when trying to access levels by index.
The bug can be observed by reaching the part of the code that checks `if rlocs == []`, which results in further incorrect processing due to the wrongly treated level numbers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the extraction process from `clocs` and `rlocs` to directly use level names rather than converting them to level numbers.
2. Ensure consistency in handling the provided level names and extract the necessary details accordingly for processing the MultiIndex columns correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    clevels = [index.get_level_values(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    cnames = [index.names[c] for c in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index([c.values for c in clevels], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [c.codes for c in clevels], xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rlocs + [comp_ids],
            names= rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

I have corrected the function to resolve the issue. This modification should handle the hierarchical columns appropriately when unstacking in MultiIndex structures.
