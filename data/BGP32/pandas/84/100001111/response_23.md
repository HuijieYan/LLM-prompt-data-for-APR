### Analysis:
1. The `clocs` parameter seems to be passed as a tuple of tuples `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` when the function expects a tuple, leading to the issue with extracting level numbers.
2. The function processing involves MultiIndex and Series objects, handling unstacking operations with specified levels and fill values.
3. The bug causes issues with identifying the level number due to incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter, which should be transformed according to the proper level indexing.
4. To fix the bug, the parameter `clocs` should be properly processed to ensure correct identification of level numbers during further operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the `clocs` tuple into a single tuple to be used for extracting the level number correctly.
2. Identify the level number using the corrected `clocs` and proceed with the unstacking operations as intended.

### Bug Fix Implementation:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert tuple of tuples into a single tuple
    clocs = (clocs,)

    # Handle hierarchical columns scenario if needed

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making the specified adjustment in processing the `clocs` parameter, the bug in identifying the level number should be resolved.
