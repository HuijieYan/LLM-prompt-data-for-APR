### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple()` is responsible for unstacking the data based on specified column locations. It handles hierarchical columns and creates a dummy dataframe to perform the unstack operation.
   
2. The bug seems to lie in the logic where the function computes `clocs` using `_get_level_number` method based on the passed column locations tuple. In the failing tests, this logic fails to correctly identify the levels, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. The bug is likely input-related, as the computation of `clocs` based on the passed tuple may not account for hierarchical columns. This issue is seen in the failing test's expected values where `clocs` should be updated based on hierarchical columns data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update how the `clocs` variable is computed to correctly handle hierarchical columns.
2. Ensure that the logic for identifying levels within `_unstack_multiple()` adequately accounts for the structure of the multi-indexed data.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Update how clocs are computed to consider hierarchical columns
    clocs = [index.get_loc(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This bug-fixed version should address the issue with the failing tests and correctly handle the unstacking process for multi-indexed data.
