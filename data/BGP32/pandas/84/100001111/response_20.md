### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of MultiIndex in pandas, but it fails in certain cases causing a KeyError, as reported in the GitHub issue. The key problem lies in how the levels are handled and the subsequent processing of the data.

### Error Locations
1. The extraction of level numbers from `clocs` list can lead to errors if the levels are not found.
2. Handling of missing `rlocs` can cause issues with the dummy data setup.
3. Processing and reconstruction of codes based on the group index can be done incorrectly.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the mishandling of levels and codes during the unstacking operation, particularly when dealing with multiple levels and improper level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure correct extraction of level numbers and handle missing levels gracefully.
2. Reorganize the process of setting up the dummy data and indices to prevent misalignments.
3. Verify the reconstruction of codes and columns after unstacking for consistency.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
    else:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues present in the original function, ensuring proper handling of levels and codes during the unstacking process.
