### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a multi-level index, but it fails due to an issue with identifying the level numbers correctly. The error message indicates that the function is trying to use the names of the levels instead of the level numbers, causing a KeyError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is responsible for getting the level numbers based on the level names, but it is not handling tuple names correctly in the case of multi-level indexes.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to use the level names directly as indexes to retrieve the level numbers. For multi-level indexes with tuple names, this approach does not work as expected, leading to KeyError or ValueError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle tuple names correctly when identifying level numbers. We should modify the logic to determine the correct level numbers based on the names of the levels in the MultiIndex.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Get level numbers based on level names
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple) and len(loc) == 2:
            level_num = [i for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name == loc]
            if level_num:
                level_numbers.append(level_num[0])
        else:
            level_numbers.append(loc)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same ...

```

By modifying the logic to correctly handle tuple names and retrieve the level numbers based on the names of the levels, this corrected version of the function should resolve the KeyError or ValueError issues encountered during unstacking operations on multi-level indexes with tuple names.
