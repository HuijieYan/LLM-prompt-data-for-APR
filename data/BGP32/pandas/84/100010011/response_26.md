### Analysis:
The provided function `_get_level_number` inside the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file is encountering either `ValueError` or `KeyError`, causing the unstack operation to fail. The function attempts to extract the index level number based on the given level name, but it leads to errors when the level name is not found or duplicated.

### Error Cause:
1. The error occurs because the function `_get_level_number` tries to locate the level number by the name given in `clocs`, but it expects the name to be a direct integer index rather than a multi-level tuple.
2. When the level name is not found in the list of names, it raises a `KeyError` with the message `'Level <Name> not found'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, the `_get_level_number` function should be modified to handle multi-level names correctly and account for the possibility of tuple names. We need to extract the actual level indices corresponding to the names provided in `clocs`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the modified `_get_level_number` function that can handle multi-level names correctly:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if not isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = (level,)  # Convert single level to a tuple
    levels = list(self.names)
    for idx, name in enumerate(level):
        level_pos = [i for i, x in enumerate(levels) if x == name]
        if len(level_pos) == 0:
            raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(name))
        levels = [x for i, x in enumerate(levels) if i not in level_pos] # Remove matched levels from the list
    return idx
```

### Updated `_unstack_multiple` Function:
In the provided `_unstack_multiple` function, replace the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
with:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Updated `_unstack_multiple` Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Extract actual level numbers based on level names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle both single-level and multi-level names, resolving the KeyError and ValueError issues.
