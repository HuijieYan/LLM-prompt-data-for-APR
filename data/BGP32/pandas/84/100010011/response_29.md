### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be trying to unstack a DataFrame based on multiple levels/columns of a MultiIndex. The error messages indicate that the function is failing to process the levels correctly. The function is extracting the level number based on the given level names, but it is encountering KeyError or ValueError due to issues in identifying the levels correctly.

### Bugs and Causes:
1. The function is using level names directly instead of using level numbers when processing `clocs` list, causing KeyError and ValueError.
2. A ValueError is raised when the name of the level is not an integer, expecting the use of a level number.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to handle both level names and level numbers correctly.
2. Identify the level number based on the provided level name using the appropriate method.
3. Change the logic to handle the scenario when the level name is not an integer and raise a KeyError accordingly.

### Bug-Fixed Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This modified code snippet fixes the bug by carefully handling level names and numbers during the unstacking process. It now correctly determines the level number based on whether the input in `clocs` is an integer or a string.
