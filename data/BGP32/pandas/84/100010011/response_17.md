### Analysis:
The error originates from the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class, specifically when converting the level name to its corresponding index. The bug occurs because the level name is being passed as a tuple instead of a string, causing the method to raise `KeyError` when attempting to find the level in the list of names.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The error occurs due to passing a tuple `('A', 'a')` as the level name instead of a string `'A'` in the `.unstack()` method.
2. The function `_unstack_multiple` directly tries to use `index._get_level_number(i)` where `i` is not a string but a tuple, causing the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where the level passed to `_get_level_number` is a tuple. We should extract the appropriate string from the tuple before passing it to the method.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract level names if passed as tuples
    clocs = [i if isinstance(i, str) else i[0] for i in clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
    # ...
```

By extracting the string name from the tuple if necessary, the code should now handle the level names appropriately, preventing the `KeyError` issue.
