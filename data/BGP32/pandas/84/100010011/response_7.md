### Bug Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class is raising a ValueError or KeyError depending on the use case. This method is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function to determine the level number from the list of level names. The issue stems from the fact that the original implementation was not handling the hierarchical names correctly.

The GitHub issue provides additional context by showing the specific test cases where unstacking fails with tuple names as level names, leading to these error messages. The unstack operation is supposed to unpack the DataFrame from a MultiIndex format for easier manipulation, but due to the bug, it fails to resolve the level names correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The issue is caused by the names of the levels not being processed correctly when they are tuples.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the original implementation did not account for hierarchical level names (tuples) when handling unstack operations. As a result, the program tries to find 'A' directly in the list of names, leading to the errors. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle hierarchical level names (tuples) while unstacking. This requires modification in how the level names are extracted and processed within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    levels = data.index.levels

    clocs = [levels.index(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else data.index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(len(levels)) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.index.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to handle tuple names correctly when extracting level numbers and processing unstack operations.
