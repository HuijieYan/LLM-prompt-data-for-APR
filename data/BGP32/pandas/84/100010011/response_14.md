### Analysis:
- The `KeyError` or `ValueError` is being raised in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class during the `_unstack_multiple` function execution.
- The error occurs when trying to find the index of a level that is represented as a tuple in the MultiIndex.
- The incorrect handling of tuple names in MultiIndex levels is causing the bug.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when trying to retrieve the level number for the passed tuple level names like `('A', 'a')`.
- The `_get_level_number` method cannot handle tuple names directly, resulting in a key or value error as the tuple is not found in the list of names.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names correctly by finding any partial match inside the list of level names.
- Allow for matching of multiple parts of a tuple name to identify the level correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if not isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
        level = (level,)

    for i, name in enumerate(self.names):
        if isinstance(name, (list, tuple)):
            if len(name) == len(level) and all(x == y for x, y in zip(name, level)):
                return i
            
    raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
```

### Corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
```

By modifying the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names correctly and making necessary adjustments, the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
