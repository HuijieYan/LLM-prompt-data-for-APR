### 1. Analyzing the Buggy Function and the GitHub Issue
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError." The issue has described a scenario where calling the `unstack()` method with a tuple name fails due to a KeyError: 'Level A not found'. The failing test cases provided in the GitHub issue highlight the problem.

### 2. Identifying Potential Error Locations
The specific error seems to arise when trying to retrieve the level number from the index based on a given name or tuple name. This operation is performed in the function `_get_level_number`, which leads to the KeyError.

### 3. Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The function `_unstack_multiple` expects the column locations (`clocs`) to be provided as input. However, these locations are used directly without checking if they are level names or level numbers. This assumption leads to errors when trying to get the level number based on the provided names or tuples, especially when multiple names exist across levels. This issue arises due to an incorrect handling of level names and levels numbers while unstacking.

### 4. Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, before using the column locations (`clocs`), we need to ensure that they are appropriate level numbers. If names or tuples of names are given, we should first retrieve the corresponding level numbers. 

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index from data
    index = data.index
    
    # Convert column names or tuples to their respective level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Other existing code remains unchanged...

    # Rest of the function remains as is
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `clocs` list to convert any column names or tuples to their corresponding level numbers before further processing. This modification ensures that we use valid level numbers when interacting with the index. This should address the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing tests.
