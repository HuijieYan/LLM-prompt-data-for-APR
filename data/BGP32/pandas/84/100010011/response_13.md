### Analysis:
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to handle multiple levels of unstacking in a pandas DataFrame.
2. The error message is indicating that the name 'A' is not being recognized when unstacking a MultiIndex.
3. The bug is occurring because the `names` attribute is a list of tuples in the MultiIndex, so trying to pass a single name 'A' causes an error.
4. The error stems from the fact that the code tries to find 'A' directly in the `names`, which is a list of tuples like `[('A', 'a'), ('B', 'b')]`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to unpack tuple names before trying to find the level number.
2. Remove the assumption that single-item levels represent exact names.
3. Check for the existence of the specific tuple in the level names to get the correct level number.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Unpack tuple names if present
    clocs = [set(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Get level number based on exact match or subset match
    def get_level_number(level):
        if any(all(n in tup for n in level) for tup in index.names):
            return next(i for i, tup in enumerate(index.names) if all(n in tup for n in level))
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function should handle tuple names and find the proper level number in the MultiIndex, resolving the KeyError issue reported on GitHub.
