### Analysis:
- The `ValueError` and `KeyError` are raised due to an issue with accessing the level number in the MultiIndex.
- The specific error message indicates that the level name `'A'` is not found in the list of names in the MultiIndex.
- The issue on GitHub also highlights similar problems where tuple names are involved in unstack operations with MultiIndexes.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the way the `_get_level_number` function is used to extract level numbers from MultiIndex names. When the level name is a tuple, it fails to find the level name in the list of names.
- The code doesn't handle the case where the level name is a tuple correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the approach to extracting level numbers for tuple level names in MultiIndexes.
- Use a more robust method to identify the correct level number when tuple names are involved in unstack operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            # Check if the loc is a tuple
            names = [name for name in reversed(loc)]
            level_number = None
            for name in names:
                try:
                    level_number = index._get_level_number(name)
                    break
                except KeyError:
                    pass
            if level_number is None:
                raise KeyError(f"Level {loc} not found")
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
        else:
            level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By handling tuple level names correctly and iterating through the names in reverse order, the corrected version ensures that the correct level number is extracted even when dealing with tuple level names in MultiIndexes.
