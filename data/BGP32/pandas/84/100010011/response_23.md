### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function within the `MultiIndex` class, where it's unable to find the specified level when dealing with a MultiIndex DataFrame. This leads to a `KeyError` during the unstack operation when tuple names are used as input. The bug is due to incorrect handling of tuple names in the level parameter during unstacking, causing the method to search for the tuple as a whole rather than considering each element separately.

### Bug Description
The `index._get_level_number(i)` method is mistakenly trying to match an entire tuple name instead of each element of the tuple separately. This causes the method to throw errors when the level name is a tuple. The code needs to be updated to handle tuple names correctly within MultiIndex.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, separate the tuple names into individual elements when processing the `clocs`. This way, we can extract the individual level names from tuple names and query them correctly in the MultiIndex to avoid `KeyError` issues during the unstack operation.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function which correctly handles tuple names in the `clocs` parameter and avoids the `KeyError` issue during unstacking:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle tuple names in the `clocs` parameter, preventing the `KeyError` issue when unstacking MultiIndex DataFrames with tuple names.
