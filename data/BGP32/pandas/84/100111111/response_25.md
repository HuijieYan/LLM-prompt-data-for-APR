## Correction of the buggy function

Based on the analysis of the failing tests, the issue seems to stem from the `_get_level_number` method which raises a KeyError if the level is not found. To correct this, we need to adjust the way levels are accessed and identified within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not clocs:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cnames = [name for name in clocs]  # Extract the names from the tuple

    rlocs = [i for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name not in cnames]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in cnames]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in cnames]
    
    # Process clocs to get level indices
    clevel_indices = [index.names.index(name) for name in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=[index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
            codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + [Index(unstacked.index)]  # Add the newly created level
        new_names = cnames + ['__placeholder__']
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [Index(unstacked.columns.levels[0])] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
    
```

With these changes, the function should now be able to correctly handle the unstacking of dataframes with MultiIndex columns and resolve the KeyError issue that was occurring previously. This corrected version should address the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
