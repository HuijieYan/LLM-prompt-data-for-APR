## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs due to an incorrect approach to handling MultiIndex level names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function attempts to get the level number corresponding to the provided level name, but there is a mistake in the implementation, leading to KeyError or ValueError when the level name is not found in the list of names.

The main issues in the code are:
1. Incorrect handling of MultiIndex level names when unstacking.
2. Inconsistencies in the processing of provided level names in tuples.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle the provided level names in tuples, ensure that level names are mapped to corresponding indices properly, and prevent the occurrence of KeyError or ValueError during the unstacking process.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Retrieve the index from the data
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This fix ensures that when processing the provided level names, it checks whether the level name is a tuple and then appropriately gets the level number. By making this adjustment, we can avoid the KeyError or ValueError that was occurring due to inappropriate handling of MultiIndex level names in tuples.

By implementing this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now properly handle unstacking with MultiIndex level names provided as tuples, resolving the issues reported in the failing tests and the associated GitHub issue.
