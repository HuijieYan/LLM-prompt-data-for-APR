### Bug Explanation:
The root cause of the bug lies in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. In the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, when trying to expand the MultiIndex, the method `_get_level_number` is used to retrieve the integer level number corresponding to the input level name tuple. However, if the level is not found in the list of names, it raises a `ValueError`.

In the failing test cases, the input level names are tuples like `('A', 'a')`. When passed directly to `_get_level_number`, it expects a string level name, causing the function to raise a `ValueError`. Subsequently, an exception is caught, and a `KeyError` is raised because the input is not found in the names list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the input format for the levels should be adjusted to match the expected input type of the `_get_level_number` method. We need to pass a single name string to the method instead of a tuple of names.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
1. Extract the individual level names from the tuple input.
2. Modify the call to `_get_level_number` to pass the individual level name string.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the individual level names from the tuple input
    level_names = [level[1] for level in clocs]

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Adjust the level names input format for _get_level_number
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in level_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code to be kept as is

    # ...
  
    return unstacked
```

Applying this correction should resolve the issue and allow the function to handle the input level names correctly, unstacking the MultiIndex without errors.
