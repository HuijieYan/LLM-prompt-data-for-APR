### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the function `_get_level_number` in the MultiIndex class, which fails to handle tuple names correctly when passed to the `unstack` method. This leads to the KeyError and ValueError errors when the function tries to determine the level numbers based on the column names. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function in such a way that it correctly handles the MultiIndex with tuple names. The fix involves correctly identifying the level numbers by adjusting the code to handle hierarchical columns (tuple names) appropriately.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This now deals with hierarchical columns correctly

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged from here on

    ...
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the column name is a tuple by appropriately getting the level number based on the tuple name. This modification should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues when the function is called with tuple names.
