## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function during the processing of multiple indices. In the function, the input argument `clocs` is expected to represent the levels to be unstacked. The issue arises when handling MultiIndex levels with tuple names, causing a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`.

### Error Cause
1. The indexing operation `_get_level_number(i)` assumes that it is dealing with integer levels and does not handle tuple names properly.
2. The issue occurs because when tuple names are used as levels, the `_get_level_number` function raises a `ValueError` instead of returning the level number.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_level_number` needs to be updated to handle tuple names correctly as levels. The function should check if the input is a tuple of names and return the correct level number.

### Updated Approach
Modify the `_get_level_number` function within the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple names as levels in the MultiIndex.

## Updated Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    def _get_level_number(index, level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
                if name == level:
                    return i
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(level)

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code unchanged
    ...
```

By updating the `_get_level_number` function to properly handle tuple names, the bug causing the `KeyError` will be resolved. This updated function should now correctly handle unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex levels.
