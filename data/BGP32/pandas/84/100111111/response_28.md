## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` function tries to find the index of a level name within a MultiIndex's names, but the function expects an integer input. When a tuple is used for both the level names, as seen in the failing test cases, the function encounters a ValueError for not finding the level name `'A'` in the list.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the input tuple for level names. We should extract the level numbers for each level name directly from the tuple rather than using the `_get_level_number` function, which expects integer inputs.

Additionally, we need to adjust the creation of the new columns in the unstacked DataFrame to properly configure the MultiIndex with the correct levels and codes.

## The Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the number of levels in the index
    nlevels = data.index.nlevels

    # Extract the levels and codes from the MultiIndex
    levels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    codes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    names = [data.index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Compute the shape of the resulting columns
    new_shape = [len(data), -1]
    for code in codes:
        new_shape[1] *= len(np.unique(code))

    # Create the new columns MultiIndex
    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(levels, names=names)

    # Unstack the data based on the MultiIndex columns
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Reshape the columns MultiIndex to match the unstacked data
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version directly extracts the necessary information from the MultiIndex rather than trying to find level numbers using their names. It then correctly generates the new columns MultiIndex based on the extracted levels, codes, and names. This approach should resolve the key error issue when using tuples as level names.
