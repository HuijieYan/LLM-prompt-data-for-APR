### Bug Explanation

The bug stems from the `_get_level_number` method in the following line: `level = self.names.index(level)`. The method is trying to find the index of a level by name. However, when passing a tuple name like `('A', 'a')`, the method cannot directly index it within the `names` list because it's a nested tuple. This causes the ValueError 'A' is not in the list followed by a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names properly. We should update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly determine the level number when passing tuple names. 

### Corrected Function Implementation

Here is the corrected implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This correction handles the case where a tuple name like `('A', 'a')` is passed as `clocs` and ensures that the function can determine the level number correctly.

By applying this fix, the function should now be able to handle unstacking with tuple names correctly and pass the failing tests provided.
