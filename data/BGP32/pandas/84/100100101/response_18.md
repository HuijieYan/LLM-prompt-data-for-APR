### Analysis:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack data based on multiple levels of columns in a DataFrame. The function currently has a bug that causes it to fail in certain scenarios, such as when unstacking tuples in MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function stems from how it handles the column levels and codes for unstacking. When unstacking multi-level columns with tuples in MultiIndex, the function does not correctly handle the new column levels and codes, leading to incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for creating new column levels and codes when unstacking multi-level columns. Specifically, we need to correctly combine the existing column levels with the new levels generated during unstacking. Additionally, we need to adjust the column codes to align with the new levels to ensure correct reshaping.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [clevels[0]]
        new_names = rnames + [cnames[0]]
        new_codes = rcodes + [recons_codes[0]]

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(("__placeholder__"), fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [clevels[0]]
        new_names = rnames + [cnames[0]]
        new_codes = rcodes + [recons_codes[0]]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By updating the way new column levels and codes are generated during unstacking, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
