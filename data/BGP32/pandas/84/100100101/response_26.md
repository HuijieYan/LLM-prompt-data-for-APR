### Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling the columns of the DataFrame during unstacking, especially when dealing with mixed-type names in the MultiIndex.

### Issue
The bug arises due to improper handling of the case when there are multiple levels of a MultiIndex and different column types during unstacking.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to revise how the columns are handled during unstacking to ensure the correct alignment and reconstruction of the MultiIndex columns.

### Updated Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Setup initial parameters from the input DataFrame
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Unstack the DataFrame based on column levels
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Reconstruct the new MultiIndex columns
    new_levels = unstacked.columns.levels + [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    new_codes = unstacked.columns.codes + [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    new_names = unstacked.columns.names + [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Create and assign the new MultiIndex to unstacked DataFrame
    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By reconstructing the MultiIndex columns correctly based on the combination of unstacked and original levels, codes, and names, the function should now handle the unstacking operation properly for multiple levels of a MultiIndex with mixed-type names.

This updated version of the function should pass the failing test cases and ensure the correct behavior for the unstacking operation on multi-level MultiIndex DataFrames.
