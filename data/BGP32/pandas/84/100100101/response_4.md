Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug is in how the function handles the unstacking process. The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on multiple levels from a MultiIndex. However, the bug causes incorrect unstacking, resulting in wrong output compared to the expected values in the failing test cases.

The bug lies in the section where the function deals with hierarchical columns during the unstacking process, especially when multiple levels need to be unstacked. The function fails to correctly determine the levels, names, and codes when restructuring the data, leading to discrepancies between the actual and expected results in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the unstacking process for hierarchical columns from a MultiIndex. The corrected version should properly identify and process the levels, names, and codes to reconstruct the DataFrame or Series with the expected structure.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the unstacking process for hierarchical columns with multiple levels from a MultiIndex. It incorporates the necessary adjustments to identify and restructure the data according to the expected output in the failing test cases.
