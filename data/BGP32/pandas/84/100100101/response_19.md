The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing failures in the test cases where the function is expected to correctly unstack a DataFrame. The bug is primarily related to how the function unstacks and reconstructs the DataFrame columns and index.

### Bug Explanation:
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect generation of new_columns and new_levels in the function. The function does not correctly align the levels, codes, and names for unstacked data, especially when the unstacked data is a DataFrame. This leads to mismatches between the expected and actual results.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the levels, codes, and names are appropriately aligned when constructing the new columns and index for the unstacked data. We need to handle the cases when the data is a DataFrame separately from when it is a Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing and fixing the bug, here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + [unstacked.index.levels[0]]
        new_names = cnames + [data.index.name]
        new_codes = recons_codes + [unstacked.index.codes[0]]
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [unstacked.index.levels[0]]
        new_names = rnames + [data.index.name]
        new_codes = rcodes + [unstacked.index.codes[0]]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

After applying this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for DataFrame unstacking.
