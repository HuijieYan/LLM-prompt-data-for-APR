### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an issue in how it handles tuple names in a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that 'A' is not found, which is a key in the tuple name, causing a `KeyError`. The function is supposed to unstack the DataFrame with MultiIndex based on the provided level(s) but fails when tuple names are involved.

The function tries to extract the level numbers from the provided `clocs` which are the columns levels to unstack. This extraction process is incorrect when dealing with a MultiIndex with tuple names.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section of the code where the function `_unstack_multiple` tries to get the level numbers from the `clocs` parameter.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of this bug is that the function is not handling the case of MultiIndex with tuple names properly. When extracting the level number, it treats tuple names as single entities rather than individual levels.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug:
1. Identify the levels correctly from the input `clocs`, especially when dealing with tuple names.
2. Adjust the extraction mechanism to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    if not any(isinstance(cloc, tuple) for cloc in clocs):
        clocs = [cloc for cloc in clocs if isinstance(cloc, tuple)]
    else:
        clocs = [item for sublist in clocs for item in sublist]

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This updated implementation includes handling the case when `clocs` contain tuple names correctly to avoid the `KeyError`. It also ensures that the levels are extracted properly for MultiIndex with tuple names.

By applying this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work correctly with tuple names in the MultiIndex.
