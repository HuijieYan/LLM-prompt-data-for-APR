The issue arises from the function `_get_level_number(self, level)` in the MultiIndex class, where it should return the level number. However, due to an error in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the passed parameters are not correctly handled, resulting in KeyError or ValueError. 

The source of the error is that the `clocs` parameter in `_unstack_multiple` should be transformed into level numbers, but due to its multi-level nature causing incorrect indexing in the MultiIndex, it leads to the error messages during execution.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.names.index(level)` operation in `_get_level_number` receives the correct format as expected. We should convert the tuple-like `clocs` parameter to a correct level number before processing it in the `_get_level_number` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Corrected way to handle clocs with tuple names
    clocs = [index.names.index(loc) if isinstance(loc, tuple) else index.names.index((loc,))
             for loc in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
  
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This correction ensures that when processing the `clocs` parameter containing tuple names, the function correctly handles them as level numbers before attempting to access the names in the MultiIndex class.
