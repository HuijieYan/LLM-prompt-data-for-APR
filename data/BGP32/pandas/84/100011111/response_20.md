### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_level_number` in the provided code fails to correctly identify the level number of a given level name in a MultiIndex. This issue leads to a ValueError when it tries to find a non-existent level name in the MultiIndex, resulting in a subsequent KeyError. The DataFrame `unstack` operation triggers this error when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

### Bug Location:
The bug resides in the function `_get_level_number` within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line where it tries to locate the index of the provided level name.

### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the function expects individual level names while the input includes tuple names like ('A', 'a'). This discrepancy causes the function to fail when attempting to find the tuple name 'A'. Hence, the error and subsequent KeyError occur due to this mismatch between expected input types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to handle tuple names correctly. It should first check if the input is already an integer (indicates the level number) and return it directly. If the input is a tuple, it should extract the names and then search for them in the list of level names.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        level_names = [name for tup_name in level for name in tup_name]
    else:
        level_names = [level]

    for idx, name in enumerate(self.names):
        if name == level_names:
            return idx

    raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Existing code...

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Existing code...

    return unstacked
```

By adapting the `_get_level_number` function to handle both individual level names and tuple names correctly, we can ensure that the unstack operation functions properly even with tuple level names. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the reported issue on GitHub.
