### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to the mishandling of tuple named levels in the `clocs` parameter within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function doesn't account for levels with tuples as names, causing an incorrect extraction of level numbers and leading to KeyError or ValueError exceptions.

### Bug Location
The issue arises within the code segment where the level number extraction is performed based on the passed `clocs`. The code doesn't correctly handle extracting level numbers when clocs represent levels with tuple names.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the level names when processing `clocs` within the function. When the tuple names are used for levels, the function fails to identify the correct level number, leading to exceptions during unstacking operations.

### Strategy for Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code responsible for extracting the level numbers based on the tuple named levels. This adjustment should involve correctly identifying the levels when the names are tuples and ensuring that the function handles this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract the level numbers correctly, handling tuple named levels
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same; ensure it works correctly with tuple names

    return unstacked
```

By adjusting the level number extraction based on whether the level is a tuple or not, the corrected function should resolve the KeyError and ValueError exceptions reported in the failing tests.
