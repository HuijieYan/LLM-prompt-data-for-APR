### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class when trying to determine the level number for a given level name. The error arises because the code is passing a tuple containing multiple level names instead of a single level name. This behavior is observed in the failing test cases presented, where the unstack operation is attempted on a MultiIndex DataFrame with tuple names.

### Bug Location:
The main issue lies in the way the `clocs` parameter is handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It expects a single level name but receives a tuple containing multiple level names. This causes problems when trying to resolve the level numbers from the index.

### Bug Explanation:
- The for-loop in `_unstack_multiple` function processes each `clocs` element assuming it is a single level name.
- The incorrect input type causes the `index._get_level_number(i)` call to fail because `i` is a tuple of names, not a single name.
- This leads to an error where it tries to find a level named 'A' and fails, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle a tuple input correctly. We should convert the tuple of names to a single level name before calling `_get_level_number`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert tuple of level names to single level name
    clevels = clocs[0] if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple) else clocs

    # Rest of the function logic assuming clocs is a single level name
``` 

The above fix will ensure that the `clocs` parameter is correctly handled as a single level name when making the `_get_level_number` call. This adjustment should resolve the KeyError issue in the unstack operation with tuple names on MultiIndex DataFrames.
