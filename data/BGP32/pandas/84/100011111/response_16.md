### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the way the function `_get_level_number` is utilized. This function tries to get the level number based on the provided level name, but in the case where the level name is a tuple, it fails due to the assumption of a single name. This inconsistency leads to the `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` followed by a `KeyError: 'Level A not found` error, causing the tests to fail. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the function can handle tuple names properly. One approach is to modify the code to check if the provided level is a tuple before handling it as a single level or multiple levels.

### Updated Function Implementation
Here is an updated version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_modified = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):  # Check if loc is a tuple
            clocs_modified.extend([index._get_level_number(i) for i in loc])
        else:
            clocs_modified.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_modified]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
}
```

This updated implementation ensures that the function dynamically handles single level names and tuple names accordingly, fixing the bug and allowing the function to work correctly with tuple names.
