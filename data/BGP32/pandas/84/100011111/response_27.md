### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to the `_get_level_number()` method in the MultiIndex class. When the `clocs` input is a tuple instead of a single level, the buggy function fails to handle it properly, leading to key errors during the unstacking process.

### Bug Location:
The error occurs when the function tries to convert the input tuple `clocs` to level numbers using `_get_level_number()` in the MultiIndex class. The function wrongly assumes that `clocs` will always be a single level instead of a tuple of levels.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `clocs` will always be a single level index. However, in the failing test cases, it is a tuple representing multiple levels. This mismatch leads to the function trying to index the names list with the tuple directly, causing errors.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of `clocs` to determine if it is a tuple or a single level index.
2. If `clocs` is a tuple, extract the levels from the tuple and then get the corresponding level numbers.
3. Handle the case of multiple levels more appropriately to avoid key errors.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple representing multiple levels
        clocs = [level[0] for level in clocs]  # Extract the levels from the tuple

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This corrected function will properly handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple of levels and extract the levels before getting the corresponding level numbers. This fix should address the key errors and make the unstacking process work correctly.
