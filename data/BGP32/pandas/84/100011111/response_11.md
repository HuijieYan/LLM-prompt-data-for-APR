### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to extract level numbers for columns in a MultiIndex using the `._get_level_number` method, which expects level names for extraction. Since the input column locations `clocs` are tuples instead of strings, the method fails to find the level names leading to `ValueError` and then a subsequent `KeyError`. This behavior prevents the unstacking process from completing successfully.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `clocs` parameter, which holds the column locations, needs to be modified to correctly extract level names from tuples. Additionally, handling how the column unstacking is performed when dealing with MultiIndexes is also crucial for resolving the bug. By adjusting the method that extracts level names and properly unstacking columns, we can ensure the function works as intended for MultiIndex unstacking operations.

### Correction

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not clocs or len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extracting the level names correctly from column locations
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [col if isinstance(col, (tuple, str)) else (col,) for col in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    return unstacked
```

By updating the function to handle tuple column locations and extracting level names appropriately, the unstacking process for MultiIndexed data should work correctly without encountering the previous errors.
