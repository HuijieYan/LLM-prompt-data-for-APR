### Bug Analysis:
The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class failing to find the level specified by a tuple with multiple names. The method expects level names rather than tuples of names, leading to a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the `_unstack_multiple` function when calling `_get_level_number` on the `index` using `clocs` that consist of a tuple with multiple names. This approach conflicts with the expected behavior of `_get_level_number` which expects level names, not tuples of names.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `_get_level_number` method assumes a single level name as input. Therefore, passing a tuple with multiple names results in a failure to find the specified level.
2. This causes the execution to raise a `ValueError` initially, which is then caught and raises a `KeyError` for the provided level tuple.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of `clocs` by unpacking the tuple of names and passing them individually to `_get_level_number`.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code unchanged ...
``` 

By looping over each name in the tuple `clocs` and getting the level number for each name individually, the corrected function ensures that each level is correctly identified, fixing the bug.
