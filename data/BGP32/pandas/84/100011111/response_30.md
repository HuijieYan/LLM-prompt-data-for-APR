### Bug Analysis:
1. **Issue**: The `_get_level_number` function in the buggy code is throwing errors when the `level` parameter is a tuple instead of an integer.
   
2. **Cause of the Bug**: The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` expects the `clocs` parameter to be integer level numbers, but when the `unstack` method is called with a tuple in the failing tests, it fails to convert tuple names to level numbers correctly, leading to the error.

3. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Modify the way the `clocs` parameter is processed to handle tuples correctly.
   - Update the `_get_level_number` logic to account for tuple names during the unstacking process.
   
4. **Proposed Fix**:
    - Update the list comprehension for `clocs` to handle tuple names properly.
    - Modify the `_get_level_number` method to correctly identify `level` as a tuple and convert it to the corresponding level number.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By updating the list comprehension to handle direct names and converting tuple labels to level numbers when necessary, the function will be able to handle cases where tuple names are provided during unstacking.
