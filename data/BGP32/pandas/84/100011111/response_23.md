### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_level_number()` is expecting a string level name, but it is provided with a tuple name like `('A', 'a')`. This discrepancy causes the function to fail with a `KeyError` when attempting to process the tuple instead of a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to treat the tuple names appropriately when calling `_get_level_number()`. We should extract the individual string level names from the tuple and then apply `_get_level_number()` to each string separately.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function using the fix described above:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]  # modify based on the value type

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix ensures that the function can handle tuple names correctly and avoids triggering the `KeyError` caused by passing tuples to `_get_level_number()`.
