### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` function within the `MultiIndex` class. This bug triggers a `KeyError` or `ValueError` when attempting to retrieve the level number for a specified level. The reason for this error is that the level specified is a tuple of names, which is not handled correctly within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is expecting a single level name; however, the test cases include tuples of names in the MultiIndex.

### Bug Location:
The bug is within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of multiple level names by converting tuples of names to a single level name before passing it to the `_get_level_number` function. This adjustment should allow the function to retrieve the correct level number and avoid the `KeyError` or `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = ['_'.join(name) for name in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code unchanged ...
```

This fix modifies the function to check if the first element in `clocs` is a tuple. If it is, it joins the names into a single level name. The rest of the function remains the same. This modification allows for handling tuples of names correctly and getting the level numbers without raising errors.
