### Bug Analysis:
- The function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering a bug when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex using tuple names, such as `('A', 'a')`, causing a `KeyError`.
- The bug arises during the indexing process where the function tries to resolve the level number for the input tuple names, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of directly using the tuple names to get the level number, the function should extract the individual level names from the tuple and resolve the level numbers for each.
- This modification will prevent the `KeyError` and allow the unstacking operation to proceed successfully.

### Code Fix:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    clevels = []
    for loc in clocs:
        level_names = loc if isinstance(loc, tuple) else (loc,)
        levels = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in level_names]
        clevels.append(levels)
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [level for levels in clevels for level in levels]]
    
    # Rest of the function code remains the same
```

### Expected Outcome:
- The modified function will correctly resolve the level numbers for the multi-level index, ensuring that the unstacking operation works without triggering a `KeyError`.
- This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
