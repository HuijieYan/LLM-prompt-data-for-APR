### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an issue in the way it handles the input parameter `clocs`, which represents the columns to unstack in the DataFrame. The error message indicates that the function is trying to index the names of the MultiIndex with the tuple `('A', 'a')`, which is causing a `KeyError` or a `ValueError` since the indexing is incorrect.

The main issues identified in the function:
1. The `clocs` input parameter is in the form of a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`.
2. The function tries to use `_get_level_number` to get the level number corresponding to the input columns, but the input is a tuple of names instead of a level number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `clocs` input parameter in the function to correctly extract the level numbers from the tuple of names.

### Updated Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from the tuple of names in clocs
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_loc(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

### Updated Bug-free Function
With the changes made as per the fix strategy, the updated `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle the input parameter `clocs` and avoid the KeyError or ValueError that was previously encountered. This updated version should pass the failing tests successfully.
