### Bug Analysis
The primary bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the conversion of input `clocs` to the corresponding level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method of the `index` object. The issue arises because the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of levels, while the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` object expects a single level name.

The error message states that the `'A'` level is not found because it is trying to find a tuple `('A', 'a')` instead. This is caused by passing the tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` as `clocs`, which is not handled correctly by the `_get_level_number` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `clocs` parameter is processed to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of level names. We should check if `clocs` is a tuple and extract the individual level names from it. Then, we should map each level name to its corresponding level number using the `_get_level_number` method.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Modify clocs to handle tuple of level names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(level) if level in index.names else level for level in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # Remaining function code remains the same
}
```

By modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function as shown above, we properly handle cases where `clocs` is a tuple of level names and map them to the corresponding level numbers. This fix should address the issue and allow the function to execute correctly.
