### Bug Analysis:
The function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame while handling hierarchical columns. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of hierarchical column names (`clocs`) when they are passed as tuples, resulting in a ValueError or KeyError due to incorrect indexing.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line tries to convert the column location tuples into level numbers in the index, which causes the error because the hierarchical column names are not correctly identified in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that `clocs` will contain integer level numbers instead of hierarchical column names. When tuples are used as column locations, they are not found directly in the index, resulting in the errors raised.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where hierarchical column names (tuples) are provided as `clocs`. We should convert the passed hierarchical column names to their corresponding level numbers in the index. This can be achieved by modifying the way hierarchical columns are identified and handled in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Change to handle hierarchical column names (tuples)
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By modifying the line that processes `clocs` to handle hierarchical column names correctly, the function should now be able to handle both integer level numbers and hierarchical column names without raising errors.
