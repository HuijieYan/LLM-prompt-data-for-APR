### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `clocs` parameter is a tuple with mixed types of strings and integers `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`. When the function tries to get the level number for each element in `clocs`, it expects all elements to be strings representing the levels' names. However, the function encounters the value `'B'`, which is not a valid level name, resulting in a `ValueError` or `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` parameter only contains valid level names as strings. This can be achieved by extracting the names from the tuples in the `clocs` parameter. We can modify the code to handle both cases where `clocs` contains tuples or straight level names.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Ensure all elements in clocs are valid level names (strings)
    cloc_names = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            cloc_names.append(loc[0])
        else:
            cloc_names.append(loc)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

This fix ensures that the code correctly handles cases where `clocs` contains tuples with both level names and positions or just level names. It extracts the level names for further processing.

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the input data and avoid the `ValueError` and `KeyError` exceptions.
