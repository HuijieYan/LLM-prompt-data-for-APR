### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the level name directly as a tuple (e.g., `('A', 'a')`) rather than as a string. This causes an error when searching for the level name using `self.names.index(level)` since the level names are stored as strings, not tuples.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level name is always converted to a string before searching for it in `self.names`. Additionally, we should modify how the level names are extracted to ensure they are strings. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]  # Convert to string before retrieving level number

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

By converting `i` to a string when extracting the level number (`[index._get_level_number(str(i)) for i in clocs]`), we address the issue of trying to access the level name as a tuple. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly.
