### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_level_number` expects a level as input but mistakenly receives a tuple `('A', 'a')` which causes the error message `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` since it tries to find 'A' in the list of level names.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

### Bug Explanation:
The function `_get_level_number` is expecting a single level name as input, but it is receiving a tuple `('A', 'a')`. This leads to the error as it tries to find 'A' in the list of level names.

### Solution:
We need to ensure that `clocs` contains only single level names and not tuples. To fix the bug, we need to modify this line to extract level names from tuples if present. 

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By checking if the elements in `clocs` are tuples and extracting the level names appropriately, we ensure that the `_get_level_number` function receives valid input and prevents the error from occurring.
