### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_level_number` is expecting the parameter `level` to be a single name, but in one of the failing tests, it is passing a tuple of names `[('A', 'a'), 'B']`. This causes a `ValueError` or `KeyError` to be raised because the tuple is not found in the list of names.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the input parameter `level` is a tuple differently than when it is a single name. We can modify the function to check whether the input `level` is a tuple and then process it accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the function to handle both single names and tuples as input for `clocs`, we can prevent the `ValueError` or `KeyError` from occurring and pass the failing tests.
