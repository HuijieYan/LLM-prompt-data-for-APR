### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from how it handles the conversion of the input `clocs` to level numbers within the index. The function attempts to get the level number by calling the `_get_level_number` method on the MultiIndex. However, it mistakenly assumes that the levels in `clocs` are already present in the MultiIndex, which leads to an error when the level is not found in the index.

In the error message, the function is trying to find the level "A" in the MultiIndex, which consists of levels ('a', 1) and ('b', 2). This mismatch causes a KeyError or ValueError depending on the exact context in the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly convert the level names in `clocs` to their corresponding level numbers within the MultiIndex. This can be achieved by iterating over the names in `clocs`, checking for their presence in the index's names, and then obtaining their corresponding level numbers. If a name is not found, an appropriate error should be raised and handled.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correctly convert clocs to level numbers
    clocs_level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        try:
            level_num = data.index.get_loc_level(loc)
            clocs_level_numbers.append(level_num)
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {loc} not found in the index")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_level_numbers]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the elements in `clocs` and use the `get_loc_level` method to obtain the level number corresponding to each name in the MultiIndex. If a name is not found, a KeyError is raised. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles the conversion of names to level numbers and avoids the previously encountered errors.
