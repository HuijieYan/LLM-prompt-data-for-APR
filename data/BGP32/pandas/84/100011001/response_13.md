### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The error occurs because the `clocs` parameter is a tuple containing nested tuples that represent a MultiIndex level. However, the function `_get_level_number` expects a single level name as a parameter, not a tuple representing a multi-level name. This causes the function to throw an error when searching for the level in the `names` of the MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the level numbers for the given column locations `clocs`. We should iterate over the elements of `clocs` and extract the level number correctly by taking into account the multi-level names. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
``` 

By modifying the line where `clocs` are processed, the function will correctly extract the level numbers for the given column locations, addressing the bug and allowing the function to work properly.
