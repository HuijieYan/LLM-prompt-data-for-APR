### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function occurs when trying to extract the level number from the column locations (`clocs`) provided as input. The function attempts to find the level number based on the names in `clocs`, but it should be looking up the level numbers in the index names. This discrepancy causes the function to raise a KeyError or ValueError depending on the context.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should extract the level numbers correctly from the index based on the column names. This can be achieved by iterating over the column names in `clocs` and finding their corresponding level numbers in the index.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
        
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index.get_loc(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

After applying the changes, the function should now correctly extract the level numbers based on the column names, preventing the KeyError or ValueError from being raised.
