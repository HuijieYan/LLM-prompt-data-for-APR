The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of indices and columns during the unstacking process. The buggy function is trying to unstack the given `data` DataFrame based on the columns specified in `clocs`. However, the logic for handling multiple levels of columns and reorganizing them is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The potential error locations are in the code block where the DataFrame is being unstacked and new indices/columns are created based on the specified levels. In particular, the incorrect usage of `unstack` and manipulation of indices and columns are causing the bug.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect reorganization of columns and indices after unstacking the DataFrame based on the provided levels. The function fails to properly reconstruct the new MultiIndex with the correct levels, names, and codes, leading to misaligned data.

To fix the bug, a revised approach is needed for handling the unstacking process, especially when dealing with MultiIndex columns. The new code should correctly reconstruct the columns and indices based on the specified levels and their relationships.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=ccodes + [comp_ids],
        names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version ensures the proper reconstruction of DataFrame columns and indices after unstacking based on the specified levels. It aligns the new MultiIndex columns correctly and maintains the integrity of the data structure during the unstacking process.
