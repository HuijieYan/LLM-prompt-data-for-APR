### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of column levels while unstacking the data. When unstacking a DataFrame with hierarchical columns, the function fails to maintain the correct levels and names for the resulting columns.

In the specific case provided:
- The function correctly identifies the levels and codes of the columns to be unstacked and reconstructs them based on the observed and compressed group indices.
- However, when creating the new MultiIndex for the unstacked data, the function improperly assigns levels and names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to ensure that when reconstructing the columns after unstacking, the correct levels, names, and codes are used. This involves accurately combining the existing column levels with the new levels derived from unstacking. Additionally, the names of the resulting columns must be set appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + clevels
    new_names = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + cnames
    new_codes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version ensures that the newly reconstructed column levels, names, and codes accurately reflect the changes introduced by unstacking, resulting in the correct structure of the unstacked data.
