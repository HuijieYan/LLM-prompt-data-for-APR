### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the code block where the DataFrame input is not a Series. When processing a DataFrame with multiple hierarchical columns, the function fails to properly handle the unstacking operation and construct the new column MultiIndex correctly. The bug becomes evident when trying to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the branch of the function that handles DataFrame inputs with MultiIndex columns. The code does not correctly adjust the column levels and codes when unstacking, causing the issue in constructing the new MultiIndex columns.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for handling DataFrame inputs with MultiIndex columns. The main issue is in the section where the new columns are constructed and assigned to the unstacked DataFrame. We need to ensure that the levels and codes of the new MultiIndex columns are properly set based on the existing columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        col_names = data.columns.names
        new_levels = [index.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [col_names[0]] + cnames
        new_codes = [index.codes[0]] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By updating the logic for DataFrame inputs with MultiIndex columns, the corrected version of the function should now handle unstacking operations correctly for both Series and DataFrame inputs.
