### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect handling of MultiIndex column names during the unstack operation. When a Tuple name is provided as the parameter to unstack, the function fails to properly process multi-level column names leading to incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame.

### Bug Location:
The root cause of the bug lies in how the function processes the column index when handling MultiIndex columns during the unstack operation.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles multi-level column indexing, especially when dealing with a Tuple name. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic related to column restructuring to properly maintain the structure of MultiIndex columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )
    
    data_copy = data.copy()
    data_copy.index = dummy_index
    
    unstacked = data_copy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should address the issue with the unstack operation for MultiIndex columns with Tuple names.
