## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter when dealing with hierarchical columns in the case provided. The function mistakenly treats `clocs` elements as distinct levels to be unstacked, leading to index mismatches and incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame.

The issue is primarily due to the assumptions made regarding the structure of the input DataFrame and the way the unstacking operation is performed. The function incorrectly unstacks each level in `clocs` independently, without considering the hierarchical nature of the columns.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to take into account that the `clocs` parameter can represent multi-level column names that need to be unstacked together. We should modify the function to correctly handle multi-level column unstacking by utilizing the full hierarchy represented by `clocs`.

The key strategy to address the bug includes:
1. Identify and extract the levels and codes from the hierarchical columns correctly.
2. Ensure that unstacking is performed consistently based on the entire set of levels from `clocs`.
3. Adjust the creation of the new index and columns to match the reshaped DataFrame's structure accurately.

By following these strategies, we can correct the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-level column unstacking appropriately.

## Bug-fixed function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the full hierarchy of column levels represented by 'clocs'
    clocs = list(clocs) if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else [clocs]
    cidx = [data.columns.names.index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    # Unstack the DataFrame based on the full hierarchy of column levels
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(cidx)
        new_levels = data.index.levels + [data.columns.levels[cidx[0]]]
        new_names = data.index.names + [data.columns.names[cidx[0]]]
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(cidx)
        new_levels = data.columns.levels[:cidx[0]] + [data.index.levels[0]] + data.columns.levels[cidx[0] + 1 :]
        new_names = data.columns.names[:cidx[0]] + [data.index.names[0]] + data.columns.names[cidx[0] + 1 :]

    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product(new_levels, names=new_names)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By making these corrections, we ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function properly unstacks DataFrame columns with hierarchical levels as indicated by the `clocs` parameter, addressing the bug in handling multi-level columns for unstacking.
