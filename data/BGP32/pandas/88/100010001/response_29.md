### Analysis:
The original `pivot_table` function has a problem when calling itself recursively with a list of aggregation functions. This leads to a scenario where the resulting dataframe table structure is incorrect, causing the attribute error when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute of the `table.columns` object. This error occurs because the result of the recursive call gets stored in `table` which may ultimately cause issues when trying to access expected attributes or methods.

### Bug:
The attribute error occurs because the result of the recursive `pivot_table` call with multiple aggregation functions ends up in `table` where the top-level series object doesn't have a `columns` attribute.

### Fix:
To correct the bug, change the recursive calls inside the loop that handles multiple aggregation functions to store the result in a separate variable and concatenate them at the end. This way, we can avoid overwriting the `table` variable and maintain its structure correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            aggregated_data = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(aggregated_data)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # Remaining code as is.
```

By implementing this correction, the function should now correctly handle aggregation functions and return the expected result without causing attribute errors.
