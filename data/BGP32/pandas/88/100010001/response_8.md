### Analysis:
The `pivot_table` function is recursively called in the function under certain conditions, leading to an Attribute Error 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This error occurs because in some scenario, the table is a Series object which does not have 'columns' attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from using the `table.columns.nlevels` in certain conditions inside the `pivot_table` function. When `agged` (which the `table` variable is assigned to) is a Series object, it does not have `columns` attribute, causing the AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `table` is an instance of DataFrame before trying to access `table.columns.nlevels` attribute. This will prevent calling `columns.nlevels` on a Series object.

### Fix:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # This condition checks if table is an instance of DataFrame before trying to access columns.nlevels
    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna and len(agged.columns):
        table = table.dropna(how="all")

        # gh-21133
        # we want to down cast if
        # the original values are ints
        # as we grouped with a NaN value
        # and then dropped, coercing to floats
        for v in values:
            if (
                v in data
                and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                and v in agged
                and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
            ):
                agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

### remaining code remains the same
