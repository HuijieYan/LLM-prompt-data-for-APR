### Analysis:
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to a 'Series' object not having the attribute 'columns'. This error occurs on this line of code: `and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)`. The error message does not provide clarity on why this attribute 'columns' access is failing. 

### Steps to Fix the Bug:
1. The bug appears to be when trying to access the 'columns' attribute on a Series object. This suggests that the 'table' variable is mistakenly holding a Series instead of a DataFrame.
  
2. We should ensure that 'table' is a DataFrame before attempting to access the 'columns' attribute.
  
3. To fix this, we can check the type of the 'table' variable before accessing the 'columns' attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def pivot_table(
    # Function implementation remains the same
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Function implementation remains the same

    table = agged

    # Check if 'table' is a DataFrame before accessing 'columns'
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and 'columns' in table:
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            # Related GH #17123
            # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
            # to the level position or name.
            index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
            to_unstack = []
            for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
                name = agged.index.names[i]
                if name is None or name in index_names:
                    to_unstack.append(i)
                else:
                    to_unstack.append(name)
            table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)
        # The rest of the implementation remains the same
```

By checking if 'table' is an instance of 'ABCDataFrame' and whether 'columns' are present in 'table', we can avoid the AttributeError from happening. This corrected version of the function should pass the previously failing test cases.
