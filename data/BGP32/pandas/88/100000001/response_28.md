## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from the `pandas.core.reshape.pivot` module. The function is intended to pivot and aggregate data in a DataFrame based on the specified index, columns, values, and aggregation function. The bug arises when the `aggfunc` parameter is provided as a list of aggregation functions. In this case, the function recursively calls itself to process each function in the list, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially infinite recursion.

## Error Locations:
1. The bug occurs when the `aggfunc` parameter is processed as a list of aggregation functions.
2. The recursion within the function leads to repeated execution for each function in the list, causing incorrect aggregation and potentially infinite recursion.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the function calling itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list. This recursive call leads to duplicate processing of the same data, resulting in incorrect aggregation and potential stack overflow due to infinite recursion.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the function when `aggfunc` is a list. Rather than calling itself recursively for each function in the list, the function should handle multiple aggregation functions within the same call. This can be achieved by iterating over the list of functions and aggregating the data accordingly without the need for recursion.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        tables = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            tables.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(tables, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    values_passed = values is not None

    <Rest of the function remains unchanged>

```

In the corrected version, when `aggfunc` is a list, the function iterates over each function in the list, aggregates the data once, and collects the results into separate tables. Finally, the tables are concatenated along with corresponding keys to return the aggregated DataFrame with multiple functions applied. This approach avoids recursive calls and addresses the bug.
