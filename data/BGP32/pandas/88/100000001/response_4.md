## Analysis:

The buggy function `pivot_table` is intended to create a pivot table from a DataFrame. The bug in the function seems to occur when `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions. In this case, the function recursively calls itself for each function in the list, but the keys are not properly handled.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The recursive call to `pivot_table` inside the loop when `aggfunc` is a list.
2. Handling of keys in different parts of the function.
3. Unstacking the table based on index names for multiple levels.

## Cause of the Bug:
When `aggfunc` is a list, the function incorrectly combines the keys without considering the individual keys for each aggregation function. This results in incorrect output when merging the results of multiple aggregation functions.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the keys are handled properly when `aggfunc` is a list. Each aggregation function should have its own set of keys to avoid combining keys across different aggregation results.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys_list = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )

            # Separate keys for each aggregation function
            keys = index + columns
            keys_list.append(keys)

            pieces.append(table)

        # Concatenate results using respective keys
        return concat(pieces, keys=keys_list, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By creating a separate list of keys for each aggregation function, we ensure that the keys are distinct for each aggregation result. Concatenating the results with their respective keys will rectify the issue of combining keys across different aggregations.
