## Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot_table` is intended to pivot a DataFrame based on specified index, columns, and values, while applying an aggregation function. The bug in the function seems to arise from the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function when the `aggfunc` argument is a list.

## Identified Error Location:
The error in the function occurs when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to a recursive call to `pivot_table`, causing unexpected behavior with the input arguments and potentially resulting in infinite recursion.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive nature of the function when `aggfunc` is a list. Each recursive call with a different aggregation function leads to reprocessing the same data, index, columns, etc., resulting in an incorrect output. This behavior will continue endlessly if not handled properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the function when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead of recursively calling `pivot_table` within the loop, we should handle multiple aggregation functions for the same pivot table in a single operation without recursion. This can be achieved by looping through the aggregation functions and computing the pivot table for each function in one pass.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = index + columns
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                for v in values:
                    if (
                         v in data
                         and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                         and v in agged
                         and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)
                
            pieces.append(agged)
        keys = [getattr(func, "__name__", func) for func in aggfunc]
        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    
    # Original code after aggregation part
    # remaining unchanged for clarity
```

The corrected version now processes multiple aggregation functions in a single pass without unnecessary recursion, which should fix the bug present in the original implementation.
