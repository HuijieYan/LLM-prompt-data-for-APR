## Analysis
The buggy function `pivot_table` is designed to pivot a DataFrame based on the provided `values`, `index`, and `columns`, applying an aggregation function specified by `aggfunc`. The issue seems to arise when dealing with `multiindex` columns, causing an `AttributeError` because the function tries to access `columns` on a `Series` object.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the following condition:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```
Here, it tries to access `columns` on `table` assuming it is a DataFrame, causing the `AttributeError` if `table` is a Series.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because in cases where the transformation is applied for multi-index columns only, the resulting object is a Series and not a DataFrame. This triggers an `AttributeError` when trying to access `columns` on a Series object.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, we need to check the type of the `table` object before attempting to access its `columns`. If it is a Series, we can handle it differently than if it is a DataFrame.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Remaining code remains the same

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and values_passed and not values_multi:
        table = DataFrame(
            {values[0]: table.values},
            columns=MultiIndex.from_tuples([(values[0],)], names=[values[0]]),
        )

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return table
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `table` is a Series by converting it to a temporary DataFrame before further operations. This change ensures that the code will not try to access `columns` on a Series object, resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
