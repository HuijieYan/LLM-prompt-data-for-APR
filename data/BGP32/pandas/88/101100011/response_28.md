### Analysis:
The bug occurs when calling the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns only. The function is expecting a result in a specific format which may not be met in this case, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `columns` attribute of what it assumes to be a DataFrame but is actually a Series.

### Error Location:
The specific error location can be identified within the `pivot_table` function where it attempts to access `table.columns.nlevels` assuming `table` is a DataFrame.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is due to the result not being properly handled when multi-index columns are passed to the `pivot_table` function. The function expects a DataFrame, but in this case, when `aggfunc` is called multiple times with different functions, the function ends up with Series type rather than DataFrame.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the result correctly to ensure that it is always a DataFrame even in cases where `aggfunc` is called multiple times. This can be achieved by ensuring that the result is concatenated properly after each call to `pivot_table`.

### Corrected Version of the Code:
To resolve the bug, we need to return the correct type (DataFrame) and avoid situations where the result is a Series. One approach is to store the results in a list and concatenate them at the end, ensuring a consistent DataFrame output. Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import concat

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original implementation
```

This corrected version ensures that the output is always a DataFrame and concatenates the results when multiple `aggfunc` are provided.

By integrating this change, the `pivot_table` function will handle multi-index columns correctly and avoid the `AttributeError` caused by returning a Series when expecting a DataFrame.
