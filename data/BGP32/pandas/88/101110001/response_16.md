### Analysis:
The buggy function defined above is the `pivot_table` function from the `pandas.core.reshape.pivot` module. The error arises when `pivot_table` is called recursively within the definition itself when `aggfunc` is a list. The issue occurs when the function tries to access the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute on a Series object, causing an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is occurring in the following line within the `pivot_table` function:
```python
and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
```
This line is trying to access the `nlevels` attribute of the `columns` attribute of the `table`. However, in cases where `table` is actually a Series object, it doesn't have a `columns` attribute, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that in case `aggfunc` is a list with multiple functions, `pivot_table` is being called recursively, and a Series object is returned instead of a DataFrame. Later in the execution, an attempt is made to work with the nested object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix this bug involves handling the return value when `aggfunc` is a list and simply accumulating the results in a list without manipulating them as DataFrames. This avoids the issue of a Series being returned and checked for `nlevels`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        table = data.groupby(keys).agg(aggfunc)
        return table

    keys = index + columns
    # Remaining body of the function remains as it is
```

By making the change above, the function correctly handles the case when `aggfunc` is a list by aggregating the data directly and returns a DataFrame, avoiding the series object issue.
