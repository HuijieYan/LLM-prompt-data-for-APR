### Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot_table` is calling itself recursively when the `aggfunc` parameter is provided as a list. This recursive call is causing unexpected behavior and potentially infinite recursion.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function is calling itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list, which leads to unexpected behavior.
2. The recursive call does not handle the case properly and lacks the necessary handling for the scenario.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the same function when `aggfunc` is provided as a list. This recursive call should not be present in the function as it can lead to infinite recursion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Avoid recursive calling of `pivot_table` within itself.
2. Instead of recursively calling, handle the scenario where `aggfunc` is a list by iterating over each function in the list and aggregating the data accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function without the recursive call:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...
    # The remaining code of the function without the recursive call
```

This version of the function avoids the recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list and properly aggregates the data for each function in the list.
