The bug in the provided function lies in the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function itself, which results in an infinite loop due to multiple calls stacking up without any termination condition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the recursive call to `pivot_table` so that it only occurs for specific cases where aggregation functions are passed as a list. In cases where aggregation functions are not a list, the function should proceed without making a recursive call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# Please ignore the functions defined within the same file as the provided buggy function

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None

    # Rest of the function remains the same as provided
    # Please ignore the remaining code

    # Note: The recursive call to pivot_table is now correctly handled for the case when aggfunc is a list
```

In this corrected version, the recursive call to `pivot_table` is conditional based on whether `aggfunc` is a list. If `aggfunc` is a list, the recursive call is made as before. Otherwise, the function continues with the aggregation process without any recursion. This modification avoids the infinite loop issue caused by the original buggy function.
