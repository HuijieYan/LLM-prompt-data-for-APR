### Bug Analysis:
- The `pivot_table` function is designed to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame, with the option to specify the index, columns, values, and aggregation function.
- The bug occurs when trying to pivot a DataFrame using multi-index columns only, which results in an AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of the case where multi-index columns are specified without any index or rows in the `pivot_table` function.
- This leads to the creation of a Series object instead of a DataFrame, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the function creates and returns a DataFrame in all scenarios, including when pivoting with only multi-index columns.
- Handle the scenario where multi-index columns are provided without any index or row to pivot.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if index is None:
        index = []
    if columns is None:
        columns = []

    if not index and not columns:
        columns = [data.columns[0]]

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Remaining code remains the same
```

### Corrected Function Explanation:
- Added explicit checks for the `index` and `columns` variables to ensure they are lists even if they are provided as None.
- Added a condition to handle the case when both `index` and `columns` are not provided, by defaulting `columns` to the first column of the input DataFrame.
- This correction ensures that a DataFrame is always returned, even when pivoting with only multi-index columns.

### With this correction, the `pivot_table_multiindex_only` test case should pass without any errors.
