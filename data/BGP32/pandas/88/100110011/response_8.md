#### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `pivot_table` function due to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute on a Series object. The error is caused by the attempt to retrieve 'columns' on a Series instance, which results in the AttributeError since 'columns' is not an attribute of Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles the case where 'table' is a Series instance by implementing a conditional check to switch the logical flow when 'table' is a Series. Additionally, since in the failing test case, multiindex columns are used, we need to ensure that the multiindex columns are handled correctly and converted to a DataFrame to resolve the attribute error.

### Corrected Function:

```python
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([tuple(i) for i in zip(index, columns)]) if isinstance(columns, tuple) else columns
    table = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=idx, aggfunc=aggfunc, fill_value=fill_value,
                             margins=margins, dropna=dropna, margins_name=margins_name, observed=observed)

    if not isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame):
        table = pd.DataFrame(table)

    return table
``` 

### Summary:
The corrected `pivot_table` function includes a modification to handle the case where 'table' is a Series by converting it to a DataFrame before returning. This correction ensures that the function handles multiindex columns properly and resolves the AttributeError that occurred when trying to access the 'columns' attribute on a Series object.
