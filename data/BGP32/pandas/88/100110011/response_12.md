### Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot_table` in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file is causing errors when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object, leading to an AttributeError.

The failing test is designed to check the behavior of the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns. The test fails due to the error in the `pivot_table` function, which results in the wrong behavior regarding multi-index columns.

The provided GitHub issue highlights this bug, explaining that the function fails to handle the correct symmetrical behavior between rows/columns and single/multi cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function checks if the `table.columns.nlevels` is greater than 1. In the multi-index column scenario, the `table` object becomes a Series, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle the case when the `table` object is a Series due to multi-index columns.
2. Ensure that the function can handle both single and multi-index column cases consistently without throwing errors.

### Correction:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, ABCMultiIndex):
        # Multi-index columns case
        keys = index + list(columns)
    else:
        keys = index + columns

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By checking if `columns` is a multi-index at the beginning of the function and handling the keys accordingly, we can avoid the error related to accessing the `columns` attribute of a Series object. This correction should allow the function to handle multi-index columns correctly and pass the failing test case.
