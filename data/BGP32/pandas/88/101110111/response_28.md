Based on the provided information, the bug in the `pivot_table` function is related to handling multi-index columns. The error occurs when trying to access the `columns` attribute on a `Series` object, which leads to the AttributeError.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the fact that when multiple aggregating functions are passed as a list to `aggfunc`, the `pivot_table` function recursively calls itself for each function. However, the final result from each recursion leads to a Series object rather than a DataFrame. Since a Series does not have a `columns` attribute, this results in the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of the returned object when multiple `aggfunc` are provided. Instead of assuming that the result is a DataFrame, we need to check the type of the returned object and handle the Series case correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        if all(isinstance(piece, DataFrame) for piece in pieces):
            return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
        else:
            return concat([piece.to_frame() for piece in pieces], keys=keys, axis=1)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version checks if all pieces returned from the recursions are DataFrames before concatenating them. If any result is a Series, it converts it to a DataFrame before concatenation.

By making this change, the function should now handle multi-index columns correctly and resolve the AttributeError when accessing the `columns` attribute of the returned object on a Series.

After applying this fix, the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values for all provided test cases.
