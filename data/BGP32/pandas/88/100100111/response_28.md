### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `columns` argument is a tuple containing two elements, and the pivot_table function attempts to create a DataFrame from it, causing an AttributeError due to referencing column's attribute on a Series.

### Bug Location:
The bug is mainly in how the code handles the `columns` input parameter when it is a tuple.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `columns` input is a tuple, it is trying to convert that into a MultiIndex. However, in the case of columns being a tuple with two elements, it is mistakenly treating it as a tuple of column names instead of being a MultiIndex. This incorrect assumption leads to creating a DataFrame with the first element of the tuple as the only column, causing the subsequent failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to differentiate between a tuple representing a MultiIndex and a tuple representing multiple columns correctly. We can achieve this by checking the type of the `columns` input parameter and handling it accordingly.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + (columns,) if isinstance(columns, tuple) else index + columns

    [...]
```

By adding a conditional statement to differentiate between a single column and a multi-column MultiIndex represented by a tuple, we can ensure that the correct structure is used for columns, resolving the issue.
