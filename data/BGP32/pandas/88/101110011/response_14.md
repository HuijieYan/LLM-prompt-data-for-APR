### Analysis:
Upon analyzing the buggy function pivot_table, it is evident that the issue arises when trying to access the attribute 'columns' on a Series object, resulting in an AttributeError. This error occurs when the function is called with multi-index columns only.

The error message indicates that the 'Series' object returned does not have an attribute 'columns' which is accessed in the function. This mismatch in object types and attribute access leads to the AttributeError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the pivot_table function at line 173:
```python
elif values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
```
Here, the 'table' object is expected to be a DataFrame, but it becomes a Series under certain conditions, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access 'columns'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect assumptions about the type being returned by the pivot_table function. When the function tries to select values conditionally based on types, it fails due to the unexpected presence of a Series object instead of a DataFrame. This happens when calling pivot_table recursively with multiple aggfunctions.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'table' object is always a DataFrame when accessing its 'columns'. We need to modify the condition to handle the case where 'table' is a Series and convert it to a DataFrame before proceeding.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the pivot_table function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        if is_list_like(values):
            values_multi = True
            values = list(values)
        else:
            values_multi = False
            values = [values]

        # GH14938 Make sure value labels are in data
        for i in values:
            if i not in data:
                raise KeyError(i)

        to_filter = []
        for x in keys + values:
            if isinstance(x, Grouper):
                x = x.key
            try:
                if x in data:
                    to_filter.append(x)
            except TypeError:
                pass
        if len(to_filter) < len(data.columns):
            data = data[to_filter]

    else:
        values = data.columns
        for key in keys:
            try:
                values = values.drop(key)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, KeyError):
                pass
        values = list(values)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        # gh-21133
        # we want to down cast if
        # the original values are ints
        # as we grouped with a NaN value
        # and then dropped, coercing to floats
        for v in values:
            if (
                v in data
                and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                and v in agged
                and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
            ):
                agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):  # Convert Series to DataFrame if needed
        table = table.to_frame()

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        ...
    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By checking if 'table' is an instance of ABCSeries (Series), we can solve the bug by ensuring that any Series objects are converted to DataFrames before proceeding to access their 'columns'. This modification ensures type consistency and prevents the AttributeError from occurring.
