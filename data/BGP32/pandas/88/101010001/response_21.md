### 1. Analysis:
The error occurs when the `pivot_table` function is calling itself recursively to apply aggregation functions on multiple columns, resulting in a Series object instead of a DataFrame object. The error message indicates that a `Series` object has no attribute `columns`. This happens when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object that was returned as the result of the aggregation operation.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely to be happening when the function aggregates the data and returns a Series object instead of a DataFrame object.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive call to `pivot_table` under specific conditions where multiple aggregation functions are passed, resulting in creating a list of DataFrame pieces that are then concatenated. Since the recursive call to `pivot_table` can return a Series object, the subsequent operations expect it to be a DataFrame object leading to the AttributeError.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when multiple aggregation functions are passed, and the `aggfunc` is of type list, the function correctly handles the aggregation and concatenation of the resulting DataFrames.

### 5. Corrected Version of the `pivot_table` Function:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if isinstance(table, DataFrame):  # Add a check for DataFrame
                pieces.append(table)
                keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        if pieces:  # Perform concatenation only if there are pieces
            return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    # Remaining code remains the same
```

In the corrected version above, a check is added after the recursive call to `pivot_table` to ensure that only DataFrame objects are appended to the `pieces` list. Finally, the concatenation is performed only if there are valid DataFrame pieces available.
