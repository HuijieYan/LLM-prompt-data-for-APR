### 1. Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The error message indicates that the `Series` object has no attribute `'columns'`, which leads to an `AttributeError`.

The `pivot_table` function is calling itself recursively when `aggfunc` is passed as a list. This recursive call leads to issues with the resultant table structure. The primary reason behind the error is the assumption that the returned table will always be a `DataFrame`, but in the case where `aggfunc` is passed as a list, the result may not be a `DataFrame` because it's created from the recursive call to `pivot_table`.

### 2. Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The recursive call to the `pivot_table` function when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to a mixture of DataFrame and Series objects.
2. The assumption that the result is always a DataFrame when it can be a Series when `aggfunc` is a list.

### 3. Explaining the Cause of the Bug

The error occurs because, in the cases where `aggfunc` is a list, the recursive call to `pivot_table` returns a mixture of `DataFrame` and `Series` objects. This leads to the resulting object not having the `columns` attribute when trying to access it while still thinking of it as a `DataFrame`.

### 4. Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

A suggested strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that the result of the recursive call to `pivot_table` is always a `DataFrame`. This can be achieved by checking the type of the result and converting it if it is a `Series`.

### 5. Corrected Version of the `pivot_table` Function

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
                table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, after obtaining the result from the recursive call, we check if it is a `Series`. If so, we convert it to a `DataFrame` using the `to_frame()` method before appending it to the `pieces` list. This ensures that the result is always a `DataFrame`, avoiding the attribute error.
