### Analysis:
The `pivot_table` function is expected to pivot a DataFrame based on the specified values, index, and columns. The error message indicates an AttributeError where a 'Series' object does not have the attribute 'columns', suggesting that at some point during the execution, a Series object is being expected to have columns.

The issue might arise from a recursive call within the `pivot_table` function where if `aggfunc` is a list, the function is invoked recursively multiple times and then the results are concatenated. Since the result of this recursive call could be a Series, attempts to access column-related properties on this Series result in an AttributeError.

### Bug Causes:
1. When `aggfunc` is a list, the `pivot_table` function recursively calls itself with different `aggfunc` values, resulting in a list of Series objects.
2. The code does not handle Series objects in the result, which leads to AttributeError when trying to access properties like columns.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list and ensure that the results from the recursive `pivot_table` calls are DataFrame objects rather than Series to avoid the AttributeError issue.

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Ensure result is a DataFrame
                pieces.append(table)
                keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

After adding the check to ensure that the result of the recursive calls is a DataFrame, this bug should be fixed.
