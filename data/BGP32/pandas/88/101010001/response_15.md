1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is `pivot_table` which is found in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file.
   - The error message shows an `AttributeError` related to a missing attribute `"columns"`.
   - The failing test cases involve different combinations of columns such as integers, strings, and a mix of both.

2. Error Location:
   - The error occurs when checking if `table.columns.nlevels > 1` in the buggy function.
   - This check assumes that `table` is a DataFrame, but in the failing test cases, a Series object is being processed.

3. Bug Cause:
   - The buggy function does not handle the case when the result of pivoting operation is a Series instead of a DataFrame.
   - Series objects don't have the `columns` attribute, leading to the `AttributeError`.

4. Bug Fix Strategy:
   - Check the type of the `table` object before trying to access the `columns` attribute.
   - If `table` is a Series, convert it to a DataFrame before performing further operations.

5. Updated Buggy Function (with Fix):
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # unchanged here

    keys = index + columns

    # unchanged code block below

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    # unchanged code block below

    # Bug Fix: Convert Series to DataFrame if needed
    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):
        agged = agged.to_frame()

    table = agged

    # unchanged code block below and onwards

    return table
```

By adding the bug fix logic to convert Series to DataFrame when needed, the corrected function will handle the cases where a Series is returned from the grouping/aggregation operation.
