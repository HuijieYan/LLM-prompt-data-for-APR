### Analysis:
Upon reviewing the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, the error occurs when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The bug is triggered when the `pivot_table` function is called with `columns` specified as a tuple representing a multi-index. This causes an attribute error because the function wrongly expects `table` to be a DataFrame, but it is classified as a Series in this situation.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The error is most likely occurring in the conditional check within the `pivot_table` function:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```
This check assumes `table` to be a DataFrame, but in the case of multi-index columns, it can be a Series.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect assumption made by the function that `table` will always be a DataFrame, leading to the attribute error when accessing the columns attribute on a Series object. 
The issue is that when multi-index columns are present, the pivot operation can result in a Series object instead of a DataFrame, which the function doesn't handle properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles both DataFrame and Series objects appropriately, especially when dealing with multi-index columns. This fix should involve modifying the conditional block that currently leads to the attribute error.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function to address the bug:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    group_keys = index + columns

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        ...
        # The code for handling list of aggfunc remains unchanged
        ...

    ...
    # Existing code to handle values and group DataFrame remains unchanged
    ...

    grouped = data.groupby(group_keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):  # Check if agged is a Series
        if agged.index.nlevels > 1:
            # Unstack when index nlevels are greater than 1 to get a DataFrame
            agged = agged.unstack()
        
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        ...
        # Existing code for handling dropna operation remains unchanged
        ...

    ...
    # Existing code for handling index nlevels remains unchanged
    ...

    if not dropna:
        ...
        # Existing code for handling dropna=False remains unchanged
        ...

    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame):
        agged = agged.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        agged = agged.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer")

    if margins:
        ...
        # Existing code for adding margins remains unchanged
        ...

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not agged.empty and (agged.columns.nlevels > 1):
        agged = agged[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        agged = agged.T

    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return agged
```

This corrected code snippet handles the situation where `agged` might be a Series and performs the required operations accordingly. This should resolve the attribute error triggered by a Series object being treated as a DataFrame in the existing code implementation.
