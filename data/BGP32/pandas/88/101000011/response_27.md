### Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot_table` in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file is designed to pivot a DataFrame based on specified values, index, and columns. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that an error occurs when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function trying to access `columns` attribute on a result that ends up being a Series object, leading to the `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs when the `aggfunc` is a list, and the function calls itself recursively, aggregating each function separately. This creates a list of DataFrame objects stored in `pieces`. Later, when trying to concatenate these pieces using the `concat` function, it expects the keys to be a list, but since `getattr(func, "__name__", func)` can return a string, it causes an issue in `concat`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `keys` variable is always a list, even when `aggfunc` is a list of functions. We can achieve this by converting a single key to a list when needed before passing it to `concat`.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append([getattr(func, "__name__", func)])  # Convert single key to list

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version ensures that the `keys` variable is always a list, resolving the issue related to the `AttributeError` when concatenating DataFrames with multiple aggregation functions.
