### Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot_table` is meant to pivot a DataFrame based on specified values, index, columns, and aggregation functions. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an error when using the function with multi-index columns, where it results in an AttributeError due to treating the result as a Series object instead of a DataFrame.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the conditional check within the `pivot_table` function that tries to handle single vs. multi-case scenarios, specifically in the following code block:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```
The assumption made here is that `table` is always a DataFrame, causing an AttributeError when it's actually a Series object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic to handle single vs. multi-case scenarios incorrectly treats `table` as always being a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError when this assumption doesn't hold true. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is correctly handled based on whether it's a DataFrame or a Series object. If `table` is a Series, appropriate actions need to be taken to avoid attribute errors.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Unchanged code

    keys = index + columns

    # Unchanged code for values handling

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    table = agged

    # Add a check for Series object and handle it appropriately
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        # Unchanged code

    # Unchanged code for dropna

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # Unchanged code

    # Unchanged code for remaining transformations

    return table
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the `table` variable is a Series object, and if so, convert it to a DataFrame before applying further operations. This modification ensures that the function can handle both DataFrame and Series objects without encountering attribute errors.
