### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `pivot_table` in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file is designed to pivot tables in pandas.
2. The function is calling itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list, which can potentially cause infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.
3. The GitHub issue mentions an error specifically when using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns only, leading to an AttributeError due to trying to access columns attribute on a Series object.
4. The bug seems to stem from not correctly handling the case when `aggfunc` is a list and the subsequent recursive call.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by recursively calling the `pivot_table` function when `aggfunc` is a list. This recursive call creates a scenario where the structure of the resulting DataFrame is modified, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute in an incorrect context.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, it's necessary to handle the case of `aggfunc` being a list differently and avoid recursive calls in this scenario. Instead of recursively calling the `pivot_table`, the individual aggregation functions should be applied separately, and then the results concatenated appropriately without risking infinite recursion or altered DataFrame structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []  # Store the aggregated pieces
        keys = []  # Store aggregation function names
        for func in aggfunc:
            # Apply aggregation function individually without recursive call
            table_grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = table_grouped.agg(func)

            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
                
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)  # Concatenate the resulting pieces

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By avoiding the recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list, the corrected version ensures that aggregation functions are applied correctly and concatenated together without altering the DataFrame structure improperly. This should address the AttributeError and provide the expected output for scenarios with multi-index columns.
