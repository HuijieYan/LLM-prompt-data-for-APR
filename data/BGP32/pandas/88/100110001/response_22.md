### Bug Analysis:
The `pivot_table` function is implemented recursively, allowing for multiple aggregation functions to be applied to the same pivot structure. The bug arises when a list of aggregation functions is passed to the `pivot_table` function, leading to a recursive call without handling the return value correctly.

In the failing tests, the error message indicates that a Series object is returned instead of a DataFrame, causing attribute access errors.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the block of code that handles the case where `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions. In this block, the function is recursively calling `pivot_table`, but the return value is supposed to be a DataFrame instead of a list of DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not aggregate the results correctly when multiple aggregation functions are provided as a list. Each recursive call generates a DataFrame, but these DataFrames are put into a list without concatenation, resulting in a list of DataFrames being returned instead of a single aggregated DataFrame.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, when processing multiple aggregation functions provided as a list, the results DataFrame from each aggregation function should be appended to a list and then concatenated before returning.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)

        # Concatenate all DataFrames in the list
        return concat(pieces, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # Remaining code unchanged
```

By correctly concatenating the DataFrames before returning in the case of multiple aggregation functions, the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function should now pass the failing test cases.
