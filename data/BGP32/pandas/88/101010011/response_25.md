### Analysis:
The `pivot_table` function in the `pandas.core.reshape.pivot` module has a bug when handling multi-index columns. When attempting to call the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute in the line `(table.columns.nlevels > 1)`, an AttributeError occurs because in this specific case `table` refers to a Series object which doesn't have a `columns` attribute. This leads to the failing test scenarios provided above.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when checking the number of levels in the columns of a table for multi-index columns. If `table` is a Series object, it does not have a `columns` attribute, causing an AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` object being checked for the number of column levels is still a DataFrame before accessing the `columns.nlevels` attribute. If it is a Series object, we should handle the case differently.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Omitted for brevity, similar as previous implementation
        
    keys = index + columns

    # Omitted the part where values are checked and filtered, previous implementation

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and agged.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = agged
    else:
        table = DataFrame(agged)  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    # Omitted the rest of the implementation, similar to the original code
```

This corrected version explicitly handles the scenario where `agged` might be a Series instead of a DataFrame. When `agged` has multiple column levels, it is directly assigned to `table`. Otherwise, it is converted to a DataFrame before proceeding to the next steps. This modification ensures that the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute can be correctly accessed without causing an AttributeError when `agged` is a Series.
