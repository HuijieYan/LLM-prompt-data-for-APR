### Analysis:
- The buggy function `pivot_table` in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file is meant to pivot data in a `DataFrame`.
- The function seems to be calling itself recursively for each function in the list of aggregation functions provided.
- The error occurs when the result of the aggregation is trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object.
- This error is likely due to the fact that the result is being treated as a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame` in certain cases, causing attribute errors when trying to access DataFrame-specific attributes like `columns`.

### Bug Cause:
- The problematic part lies in the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function if `aggfunc` is a list.
- When the function calls itself with each function from `aggfunc`, the result should be a list of `DataFrame` objects. However, the current implementation results in a single DataFrame in a list if `aggfunc` is a list with multiple functions.
- The subsequent assumption that all elements in `pieces` will be DataFrames can be invalid, causing the incorrect handling of the result later in the function.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the result of each recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list is a `DataFrame`.
2. When concatenating the results in `pieces`, make sure each element in `pieces` is a DataFrame to avoid erroneous attribute access later in the function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
                raise ValueError("Aggregation function did not return a DataFrame.")
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By ensuring that each recursive call returns a `DataFrame` and updating the handling of the results in pieces, the corrected function should now handle multi-aggregation functions correctly without raising attribute errors later on.
