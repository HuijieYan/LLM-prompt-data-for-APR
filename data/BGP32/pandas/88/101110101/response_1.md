The bug in the provided function stems from the recursive call within the function that leads to an attribute error when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object. This leads to the error where 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns' during the test executions.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if the 'aggfunc' parameter passed to the function is a list. If it is a list, we should handle the aggregation separately for each function in the list and concatenate the results at the end. This eliminates the need for the recursive call that was causing the attribute error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# Add the import statements if needed

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
                
                for v in values:
                    if (v in data) and is_integer_dtype(data[v]) and (v in agged) and (not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)
                        
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns
    values_passed = values is not None

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the case where 'aggfunc' is a list and perform the necessary aggregation operations without getting into a recursive call, thus fixing the attribute error issue.

After applying this fix, the function should pass all the failing test cases provided.

Make sure to test the corrected function thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected in various scenarios.
