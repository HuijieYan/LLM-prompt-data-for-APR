### Explanation:
The main issue in the buggy function is that it enters a recursive loop when `aggfunc` is a list. When `aggfunc` is a list, the function calls itself recursively with each element of the list, causing the same code to be executed multiple times for the same input data. This recursive call with the same parameters ultimately leads to a `Series` object being returned instead of the expected `DataFrame`. This `Series` object does not have an attribute `columns`, which triggers the `AttributeError` when trying to access `table.columns.nlevels`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to prevent the recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead, we should directly handle the list of functions to aggregate the data without calling the function recursively. We can achieve this by iterating over the list of functions and aggregating the data with each function individually. Additionally, we need to make sure that the return type is always a `DataFrame` as expected.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas import Series

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            if isinstance(func, str):
                func = func.capitalize()  # Adjust any function names if needed
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg({values: func})
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns) > 0:
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # The remaining code of the function as it is

    """
    Original buggy function code...
    """

```

By making the modifications as described above, the corrected function should now properly handle the case when `aggfunc` is a list and avoid the recursive calls that led to the error.
