### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `pivot_table` function is recursively called with different values for the `aggfunc` parameter. The issue arises when multiple aggregation functions are provided in a list for `aggfunc`. The function runs recursively multiple times with different aggregation functions, but when aggregating the results together, it fails to correctly concatenate the resulting DataFrames.

The error message `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` indicates that the variable `table` is being treated as a Series object at a certain point in the function, which leads to the failure when trying to access the `columns` attribute from a Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where multiple aggregation functions are provided correctly. We need to ensure that when aggregating results from multiple functions, the output is properly converted back to a DataFrame format before further operations.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function based on the analysis provided:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # Remaining code remains the same from the original function
```

This correction ensures that when multiple aggregation functions are provided, the resulting pieces are correctly concatenated into a DataFrame using the `concat` function. This fixes the bug that caused the function to fail when aggregating results with multiple functions.
