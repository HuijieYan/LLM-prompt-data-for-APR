### Analysis:
The GitHub issue details an error that occurs when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns only, leading to an `AttributeError` due to a `Series` object having no attribute `columns`. The specific problem arises when accessing the `columns` attribute of `table`, which is raising the AttributeError.

### Error Location:
- The error occurs in the `pivot_table` function when trying to access the `columns` attribute of the `table`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises due to the assumption that `table` is always a DataFrame, leading to the `AttributeError` when `table` is actually a Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to address the scenario where `table` is a Series and doesn't have a `columns` attribute. This can be done by checking the type of `table` before attempting to access its `columns`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        if table.index.nlevels > 1:
            table = table.to_frame()

    # existing code

    return table
```

By checking the type of `table` and converting a Series to a DataFrame if needed, the corrected function ensures that the `columns` attribute can be accessed without raising an `AttributeError`.
