### Analysis
The function `pivot_table` is calling itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list of functions, potentially causing an infinite loop. This self-call is meant to call the function again with each function in the list `aggfunc`, but the implementation is incorrect and does not break out of the loop properly.

The issue arises when the function checks if `aggfunc` is a list, and then proceeds to enter a loop where it calls `pivot_table` with each function separately. However, the function does not check for a base case to determine when to stop calling itself.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation of the `pivot_table` function is due to the recursive call without the proper stopping condition. When `aggfunc` is a list, it recursively calls `pivot_table` with a single function from the list, adding to the stack and potentially causing infinite recursion.

### Fix
To fix the bug, you need to add a base case that stops the recursive call when no more functions are left in the list. This can be achieved by checking if all functions in the list have been processed, and then returning the concatenated result.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))
        
        # If all functions have been processed, concatenate the results
        if len(pieces) > 0:
            return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

This corrected version includes the base case check after processing all functions in the list, ensuring that the function does not continue to call itself indefinitely.
