### Analysis
The buggy function `pivot_table` is recursively calling itself when `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions. This recursive call is meant to iterate over each function in the list and aggregate the data accordingly. However, the implementation is incorrect because at the end of this recursion, it tries to concatenate the results using the `concat` function, which expects a DataFrame but receives a list of DataFrames. This results in the error due to trying to access `columns` on a single DataFrame object.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the recursive call returns a list of DataFrames instead of a single DataFrame, which is expected by the subsequent logic trying to concatenate the results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions. We should accumulate the tables in a list during each recursive call, and after all iterations are completed, concatenate these tables into a single DataFrame.

### Updated Implementation

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        if len(pieces) == 0:
            return DataFrame()  # Return an empty DataFrame if no pieces
        elif len(pieces) == 1:
            return pieces[0]  # Return the single DataFrame directly
        else:
            return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)  # Concatenate the list of DataFrames

    # Remaining logic for the function remains unchanged
```

After making this change, the function will correctly handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions and return the aggregated results by either returning a single DataFrame if there is only one result, or concatenating multiple DataFrames into a single one when there are multiple results. This fix should resolve the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values.
