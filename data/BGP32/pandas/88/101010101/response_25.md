Based on the error message and the expected case scenarios provided, we can see that the main issue in the buggy function is when it tries to access the `columns` attribute on a Pandas Series object. This attribute doesn't exist on a Series, only on DataFrames.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the buggy function to handle the case where the input `data` is actually a Series, and appropriate steps should be taken to convert it to a DataFrame before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Check if input data is a Series, convert it to a DataFrame
    if isinstance(data, ABCSeries):
        data = data.to_frame()

    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Rest of the function remains the same for now...

``` 

This correction ensures that if the `data` input is a Series, it will be converted to a DataFrame before processing. Now, the function should be able to handle Series inputs correctly and avoid the AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute.
