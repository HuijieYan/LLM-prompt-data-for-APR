### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module.
2. The function is responsible for computing time bins and labels for time-interval grouping based on the given `DatetimeIndex` object and frequency.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect generation of time bins and labels due to the misalignment of frequencies.
4. The bug causes the incorrect alignment of the time bins and labels, leading to unexpected results in downstream calculations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins and labels are aligned correctly and that the labels match the frequency provided.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely occurs due to the incorrect alignment of time bins and labels, leading to discrepancies between bins and labels. This can cause issues with downstream calculations such as aggregation or grouping.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `bin_edges` and `labels` are aligned correctly according to the frequency provided.
2. Adjust the labels based on the frequency and closed/left/right settings.
3. Modify the process for adjusting bin edges to match the labels appropriately.
4. Adjust the logic for handling potential `NaN` values in the input axis.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels.shift()
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to properly align the time bins and labels, ensuring correct handling of frequencies and closed/left/right settings.
