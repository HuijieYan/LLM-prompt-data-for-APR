### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which inherits from `Grouper`. The function is responsible for calculating time bins based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. However, the bug seems to arise from how the function handles the `first` and `last` timestamps, potentially causing issues in calculating the bins correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps to define the time range for binning. The `date_range` function is used to generate the bin boundaries, but due to potential issues with handling nanoseconds, the last bin might end slightly before the intended end time. This can lead to errors in binning, resulting in incorrect labels and potentially more labels than bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function generates the bin boundaries correctly without losing nanosecond precision. One approach could be to adjust how the `start` and `end` timestamps are obtained to avoid time precision loss. Additionally, we need to ensure that the labels and bins are correctly aligned and that the correct number of labels are generated based on the bins.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        periods=(len(ax) + 1) if self.closed == 'right' else len(ax),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts how the `date_range` function is called to ensure the correct number of timestamps are included in the range. It also handles label alignment and adjustment when necessary to avoid mismatches between labels and bins. This should address the bug and ensure correct binning behavior for the `TimeGrouper` class.
