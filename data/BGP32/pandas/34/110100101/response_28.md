### Analyze the buggy function
The function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for time-interval grouping. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as input and calculates the time bins based on the specified frequency and other parameters. The bug seems to be related to how the bins and labels are generated.

### Identify potential error locations
1. Calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
2. Generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`.
3. Adjusting bin edges and generating bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
4. Slicing labels based on the closed and label parameters.
5. Handling NaN values in binner and labels.
6. Adjusting labels if the number of bins is less than the number of labels.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug results in incorrect binning and labeling of the time intervals, leading to mismatched bin edges and labels causing inconsistent outputs. This behavior is evident in the failing test case where the expected output does not match the actual output due to incorrect binning.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated correctly without losing nanosecond precision.
2. Generate `binner` and `labels` accurately based on the frequency and time range.
3. Adjust the bin edges appropriately to align with the time intervals.
4. Ensure that labels are sliced correctly based on the closed and label parameters.
5. Handle NaN values properly in binner and labels.
6. Ensure consistency between the number of bins and labels.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate first and last timestamps without losing nanosecond precision
    first = ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    last = ax[-1].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring correct timestamp calculations, accurate binning and labeling, adjustment of bin edges, and handling NaN values appropriately, the corrected function should provide the expected output and pass the failing test case.
