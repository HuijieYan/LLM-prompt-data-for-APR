### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which handles time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input parameter `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, and if not, it raises a `TypeError`.
3. The bug seems to arise when adjusting bin edges and labels for time grouping, particularly due to a `%H` substitution error when converting timestamps. This leads to mismatched labels and bins.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges and labels are correctly aligned with the time series data in the `DatetimeIndex`.
5. We should make necessary adjustments in the code to ensure proper handling of time zones and timestamps.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of timestamps with differing time zones when adjusting the bin edges and labels. The use of absolute time values without considering the time zone differences leads to discrepancies between the bins and labels, resulting in unexpected results during time grouping operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the timestamps are properly aligned within the time zones specified in the `DatetimeIndex`.
2. Adjust the bin edges and labels considering the time zone information to avoid mismatched bins and labels.
3. Use the appropriate time offset calculation to generate accurate bin edges and labels for the time series data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust bin edges and labels considering time zones and timestamp variations
    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + self.freq

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins available
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the first and last timestamps based on the time zone and considering the frequency offset, we can ensure that the bin edges and labels align correctly with the time series data in the `DatetimeIndex`. This correction should resolve the bug and enable accurate time-interval grouping operations.
