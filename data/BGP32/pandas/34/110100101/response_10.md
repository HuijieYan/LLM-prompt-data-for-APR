### Bug Explanation
In the `_get_time_bins` function, there seems to be an issue when adjusting the bin edges based on a given frequency. The code is trying to adjust the bin edges but may not be doing so correctly, leading to incorrect binning and labels.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function call within the `_get_time_bins` function. The adjustment of bin edges may not be aligning properly with the given frequency, causing incorrect binning.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges are aligned properly with the frequency specified. This may involve calibrating the bin edges to match the frequency more accurately to prevent any discrepancies in binning and labels.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring that the bin edges are adjusted correctly based on the specified frequency, this corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
