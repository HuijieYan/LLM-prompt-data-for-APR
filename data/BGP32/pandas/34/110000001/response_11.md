### Analysis:
The `_get_time_bins` function is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function is responsible for calculating time bins based on the input `ax` and various parameters.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to adjust bin edges using `_adjust_bin_edges` method. The function does not handle the case where the length of `bins` is less than the length of `labels`, causing an index out of bounds error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the situation where the number of labels is greater than the number of bins after adjusting the bin edges. This leads to an index out of bounds error when trying to access labels that do not exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the length of labels matches the length of bins after adjusting the bin edges. We can truncate the labels array if it is longer than the bins array to prevent index out of bounds errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the length of `labels` is truncated to match the length of `bins` if necessary, preventing any index out of bounds errors.
