## Analysis:
The function `_get_time_bins` is intended to return time bins based on the input data, but there seems to be a bug in the way labels are handled within the function. There are some operations being carried out on `labels` that may lead to incorrect results.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the function is related to the handling of labels when defining the bins. Specifically, the logic for slicing the labels array based on the `self.label` and `self.closed` conditions seems to be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect slicing of the `labels` array based on the conditions of `self.label` and `self.closed`. Depending on the combination of these values, the correct slicing operation is not being applied, causing potential discrepancies in the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the labels are sliced correctly based on the conditions of `self.label` and `self.closed`. We should also ensure that the length of the `labels` array matches the length of the `bins` array to avoid any index out of bound errors or misalignment.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I ensured that the slicing logic for `labels` according to `self.label` and `self.closed` is correct to guarantee the desired behavior of the function. Additionally, I adjusted the slicing operation to handle the correct indexes based on the conditions.
