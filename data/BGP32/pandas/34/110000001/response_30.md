The potential error location in the buggy function `_get_time_bins` is in the logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins based on the input data. The bug may arise due to incorrect handling of the bin edges and labels.

The bug in the function is related to the adjustment of bin edges and labels, which may lead to incorrect binning of the data. The issue specifically occurs when adjusting the bin edges using `_adjust_bin_edges` and generating bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`. This can result in mismatched bin edges and labels, leading to incorrect binning of the data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges are correctly adjusted and aligned with the labels. Additionally, we should handle cases where the number of labels exceeds the number of bins to avoid mismatches.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensured that the bin edges are correctly aligned with the labels, and we adjusted the labels based on the binning logic. Furthermore, we handled the mismatch cases where the number of labels exceeds the number of bins. These changes should help in preventing the bug and improve the accuracy of data binning in the resampling process.
