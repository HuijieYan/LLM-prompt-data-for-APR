The buggy function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is responsible for generating time bins for grouping based on the input axis `ax`. The potential error location in this function is the handling of labels and bins, which may lead to incorrect grouping or errors.

The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of labels and bins when adjusting the time bin edges based on the input axis `ax`. The issue arises when adjusting the bin edges and generating bins where the labels and bins may not align correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the labels and bins are properly aligned after adjusting the bin edges. One possible strategy to fix the bug is to restructure the code that adjusts the bin edges and generates the bins to ensure proper alignment of labels and bins.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I have ensured that the labels and bins are properly aligned after adjusting the bin edges and generating bins. This should help in fixing the bug related to incorrect alignment of labels and bins in the `_get_time_bins` function.
