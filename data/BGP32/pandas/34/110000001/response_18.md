## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. It is responsible for calculating the time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex. The function performs various operations such as generating bin edges, adjusting bin edges, and generating bins.

## Identified Errors:
1. The calculation of `labels` is incorrect in the current implementation.
2. The adjustment of `labels` if the `closed` attribute is set to "right" is not handled properly.

## Explanation:
The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is primarily related to the incorrect handling of `labels`. When the `closed` attribute is set to "right" and `label` attribute is also set to "right", the `labels` are being shifted incorrectly, leading to potential issues in labeling the bins. Moreover, the adjustment of `labels` and `binner` when `ax.hasnans` is True is not implemented correctly, as the `insert` method is used inappropriately which can cause data inconsistencies.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the calculation of `labels` based on the values of `closed` and `label` attributes.
2. Properly adjust the `labels` and `binner` when `ax.hasnans` is True.
3. Ensure that the number of `labels` matches the number of bins to prevent any indexing issues.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[:-1]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
- The calculation of `labels` based on the values of `closed` and `label` attributes is fixed.
- Proper adjustment of `labels` and `binner` when `ax.hasnans` is True is handled correctly.
- The adjustment to ensure the number of `labels` matches the number of bins is included to prevent any indexing issues.

This corrected version should resolve the identified issues in the original buggy function `_get_time_bins`.
