## Analyzing the Bug

### Buggy Function Description
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class that is responsible for creating time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex` based on specified frequency, closed end, and label. It first performs checks on the input `ax` to ensure it's a `DatetimeIndex` and not empty. Then, it calculates the first and last timestamp range edges. Finally, it generates bins based on the input values and returns the calculated bins.

### Error Location
The error seems to be related to the generation of date ranges for binner and labels in the function. The issue arises from the ambiguous time conversion during a clock change day in Cuba, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `date_range` function used to generate `binner` and `labels` does not handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba.
2. This leads to a mismatch in the timestamps, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation on the DataFrame.

### GitHub Issue
The provided GitHub issue details a similar problem with pandas `GroupBy` on a clock-change day in Cuba, where the ambiguous time during the clock change causes the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Strategy for Bug Fixing
To address this issue, we need to modify the way `binner` and `labels` are being generated to ensure they correctly handle the ambiguous time on clock change days in Cuba. This involves adjusting the timestamps to prevent the occurrence of the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Generating corrected binner and labels with ambiguous parameter
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly providing the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function call, we ensure that the ambiguous time issue is handled correctly during the generation of `binner` and `labels`, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and align with the expected input/output values provided.
