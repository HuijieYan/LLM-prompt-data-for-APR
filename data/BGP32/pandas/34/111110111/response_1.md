## Solution

### Bug analysis
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which handles time-interval grouping.
- The error occurs due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day.
- The failing test case uses a timestamp that falls within the ambiguous time range.
- The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling inconsistent timestamps during a clock change.
- The expected behavior is to group the data by day without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug locations
1. The issue arises during the creation of `bin_edges` for grouping due to ambiguous timestamp handling.
2. Incorrect handling of timestamps on clock change days leads to `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug explanation
- The grouping logic in `_get_time_bins` function doesn't account for the ambiguity in timestamps during a clock change day.
- The invalid handling of timestamps results in an error while creating `bin_edges` which leads to the erroneous grouping behavior during the time interval change.
- The error is prominent in time zones with a transition like Daylight Saving Time changes.

### Bug fix strategy
- Modify the logic related to timestamp handling on clock change days to ensure correct binning of the time intervals.
- Use the correct timezone conversion to handle ambiguous timestamps during the transition period.

### Corrected Function

```python
from pandas.errors import AmbiguousTimeError

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        # handle mismatch between bins and labels
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version includes modifications to handle ambiguous timestamps during bin creation and ensure correct grouping on clock change days.

This fix is based on incorporating proper timezone handling and adjustment of timestamps to handle the specific case of an ambiguous transition period.

By updating the logic, the corrected function should now group the data correctly without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` during execution.
