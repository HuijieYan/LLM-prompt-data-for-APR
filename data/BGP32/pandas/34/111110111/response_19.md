## Correction Strategy
1. The error message indicates that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError` occurring due to handling the timestamp during a clock change day, specifically in Cuba.
2. To address this issue, the handling of timestamps on transition days needs to be improved, especially around ambiguous time periods.
3. The adjustment of how the bin edges are generated and the treatment of ambiguous times should be modified to avoid the error.
4. By making adjustments to the bin edges generation and handling the timestamps more explicitly, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        if first.timestamp() == last.timestamp():
            last += self.freq  # adjust last edge when both are the same
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
- We handle the case where the first and last edges of the timestamp range are the same, which could lead to an ambiguous time situation on transition days.
- By adjusting the last edge when both first and last are the same, we ensure a clear distinction between the time bins.
- This correction addresses the specific issue related to clock change days during daylight saving time transitions.

By utilizing this corrected version, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved for the specific scenario mentioned in the GitHub issue.
