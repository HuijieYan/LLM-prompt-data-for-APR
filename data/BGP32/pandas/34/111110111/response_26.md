Based on the information provided, the bug in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to daylight saving time during groupby operations in pandas.

### Error Analysis:
The error occurs on a day when daylight saving time changes, resulting in an ambiguous timestamp at midnight. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised during groupby operations with daily frequency. The issue stems from how the bins and bin labels are being generated, causing a mismatch and triggering the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the binning is handled for time intervals that contain ambiguous timestamps, such as during daylight saving time changes. By modifying the generation of bins and bin labels to correctly handle this ambiguity, we can ensure the groupby operation functions as expected even on problematic days like these.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    labels = labels.tz_localize(ax.tz)  # Ensure labels have the same timezone as the input DatetimeIndex

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By fixing the binning process, handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, and ensuring consistency in timezones, this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method should now prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` and correctly group data even during daylight saving time changes.
