### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is meant to handle time-interval grouping but fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days.
2. The main issue arises when handling the time bins on the day of the clock change because midnight is an ambiguous timestamp.
3. The function improperly constructs `binner` and `labels` based on the start and end timestamps, which results in inaccurate binning when crossing the ambiguous time.
4. The error is triggered when calling `groupby` on a DataFrame with a daily frequency, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the time bins are constructed to correctly handle the ambiguous time issue on clock change days.
2. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `binner` and `labels` variables accurately represent the time intervals and avoid the creation of ambiguous timestamps.
3. By handling the time bins more accurately, we can prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring during the grouping operation.

### Corrected Function Implementation:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the start and end dates from DatetimeIndex
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    # Generate bins avoiding ambiguity on clock change days
    if self.closed == "left":
        bins = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed='left')[:-1]
    else:
        bins = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed='right')[1:]
    
    bin_edges = bins.values
    binner = labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on bin_edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    # Handle NaN values
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function according to the above strategy, the bug causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days should be resolved.
