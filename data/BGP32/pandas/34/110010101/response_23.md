### Potential Error Locations
1. The error seems to be related to a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs during the `date_range` call in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. The conversion from UTC to the specific timezone (America/Havana) might be causing the ambiguity issue.
3. The handling of daylight saving time during the conversion could lead to the error message.

### Bug Explanation
1. The error `Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00` is likely due to an ambiguous time during the daylight saving time shift.
2. The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating bin edges and labels for time grouping.
3. The issue could be in the handling of time zone conversion and daylight saving transitions when generating the time bins.
4. The ambiguity in the time shift causes the error to be raised during the `date_range` generation due to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the time zone conversions are handled correctly, especially around daylight saving time transitions.
2. Adjust the logic related to time zone handling to avoid ambiguity in the time representation.
3. Potentially consider using localized time zone information to correctly handle the time shifts.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses potential ambiguity issues related to time zone conversions and daylight saving time shifts, ensuring that the `date_range` generation does not lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
