### Analysis
The error message indicates that the "AmbiguousTimeError" is being raised while trying to create date ranges due to conflicting time zones or ambiguous daylight savings time. This occurs when converting time zones during the date range creation process. One probable cause is the conversion from "UTC" to "America/Havana" time zone, resulting in conflicting time periods due to daylight savings time changes.

### Bug Location
The issue is likely arising in the `_get_time_bins` function's `date_range` call, as it's crucial for creating the binner and labels.

### Bug Explanation
1. The conversion from UTC to "America/Havana" seems to be causing conflicts because of ambiguous time, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To correct the error, it's necessary to handle the conversion between time zones properly and address any ambiguous time conflicts.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code snippet adjusts the way dates are rounded and creates the binner and labels accordingly. It no longer directly converts between time zones, which eliminates the ambiguity causing the error. This correction should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
