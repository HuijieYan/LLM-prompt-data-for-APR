### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library, specifically in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` file is encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the behavior of the `_get_time_bins` function.
3. The error occurs when trying to group by a daily frequency that involves a clock change day, such as in the Cuba timezone, leading to ambiguous timestamp handling issues.
4. The GitHub issue #23742 discusses a similar problem that was fixed in version 0.24. However, this issue seems to persist in version 0.24.2.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class not handling ambiguous timestamp situations correctly. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by a daily frequency involving days with clock changes.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify how the timestamps are handled in the `_get_time_bins` function to properly account for ambiguous time situations, particularly on clock-change days. By updating the logic to handle such cases, we can prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner, labels = self._get_binner_for_time(ax)

    return binner, [], labels


def _get_binner_for_time(self, ax):
    first = ax[0].floor("D")
    last = ax[-1].ceil("D")

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        periods=len(date_range(first, last, freq=self.freq)),
        name=ax.name,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the `_get_time_bins` function to delegate the actual time binning logic to a separate `_get_binner_for_time` method, we can refactor the timestamp handling to correctly address ambiguous time situations, ensuring that the `AmbiguousTimeError` does not occur.
