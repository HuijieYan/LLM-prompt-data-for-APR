### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is responsible for generating time bins for resampling, but it leads to an error when dealing with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days as highlighted by the failing test due to incorrect handling of daylight saving time transitions.
2. The error occurs when in the presence of ambiguous time, `pd.date_range` function throws `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`, causing the test to fail.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` clearly indicates that the code fails to handle the transition in time appropriately, which the user expects to be managed gracefully.
4. The GitHub issue #23742 reported a similar problem which was fixed in version 0.24, but this issue seems to persist.
5. To resolve the issue, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly and avoid the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.
6. By ensuring that the timestamp generation logic considers the transition on clock change days, we can prevent the error and allow the resampling to work as expected.

### Fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()
    last = ax.max().to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By converting the `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` values to periods and back to timestamps, we ensure that the timestamp adjustment considers the daylight saving transitions correctly. This change should rectify the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` issue and allow the resampling to work smoothly even on clock change days.
