### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the TimeGrouper class and is responsible for fetching the time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample timestamps with a frequency of 1 day, triggering the code path that leads to the buggy function.
3. The error message mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError`, indicating an issue related to handling daylight saving time changes.
4. The GitHub issue #23742 raised a similar problem but didn't completely address it, leading to this specific scenario failing.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` creates a `date_range` based on the first and last timestamps, however, during a daylight saving time transition, it doesn't handle ambiguous times correctly.
2. The `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when the `pd.Grouper` is used to group timestamps that fall into ambiguous times which should be handled gracefully.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous time situations, especially during daylight saving time transitions.
2. Consider adjusting the code logic to correctly process edge cases involving ambiguous times to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas import DateOffset

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max() + DateOffset(seconds=1)  # Adjusting last to include all timestamps
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",  # Treat ambiguous times as NaT
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the `last` timestamp by 1 second and treating ambiguous times as NaT (Not a Time), we can ensure that the `AmbiguousTimeError` is avoided in ambiguous time scenarios like daylight saving time transitions.
