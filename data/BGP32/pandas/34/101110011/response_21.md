### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
   
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax`, a DatetimeIndex.

3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` tries to group data by day (`freq=1D`) which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of datetimes on a clock-change day in Cuba.

4. The error occurs when the `dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()` line is executed, which eventually leads to the `_get_time_bins` function in `resample.py` being called, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

5. The GitHub issue `GH #25758` explains a similar problem where the grouped data contains ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change, specifically on November 4, in Cuba.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. The `date_range` call in the `_get_time_bins` function is generating time bins that result in ambiguous times leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` generation handles ambiguous times correctly, especially during a clock change day. One approach could be to manually adjust the timestamps when generating these date ranges to avoid ambiguous time errors.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, the `date_range` is adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps properly using the `ambiguous="infer"` option. This modification resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs during grouping on a clock-change day in Cuba.

Please test this corrected version against the failing test to ensure that the issue has been resolved successfully.
