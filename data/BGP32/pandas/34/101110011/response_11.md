### Bug Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` triggers the groupby operation using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`, which eventually calls the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file.
2. The `_get_time_bins` method tries to generate bins using the `date_range` function, but due to an issue related to daylight saving time on clock change days (like in Cuba on 2018-11-04), it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The GitHub issue #23742 had a similar nature of problem, but it wasn't completely resolved to handle ambiguous times on clock-change days like November 4th.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `date_range` function is unable to handle ambiguous times, especially on clock-change days, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during bin generation.
2. The error occurs because `date_range` internally uses `DatetimeArray._generate_range`, which fails to handle these specific cases, causing the test to fail with the mentioned error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To handle ambiguous times on clock-change days, a fix should ensure that `date_range` or the related functions handle such cases gracefully without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The generation of bins and labels for time grouping needs to be carefully adjusted to consider instances where a timestamp might be ambiguous due to daylight saving time transitions.
3. By adjusting the bin generation logic or the way time labels are assigned, the issue of failing on clock-change days can be addressed effectively.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Method:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Proposed Fix:
1. Added the parameter `ambiguous="NaT"` to the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT instead of raising an error.
2. By inserting `NaT` for ambiguous times, the bin generation and labeling process should now handle clock-change days gracefully.

By implementing this fix, the correction should address the issue of failing on clock-change days like November 4th, 2018, in Cuba due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during time grouping operations.
