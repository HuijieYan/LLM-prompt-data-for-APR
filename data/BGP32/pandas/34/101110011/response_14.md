### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` belongs to the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the `DatetimeIndex` input.
3. The error occurs during the process of converting timestamps between different time zones due to ambiguous timestamps on the "clock change day."
4. The failing test highlights the issue when using the `groupby(pd.Grouper)` function.
5. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling ambiguous timestamps during the `tz_localize_to_utc` conversion.
6. The GitHub issue #25758 provides a similar scenario where the `AmbiguousTimeError` is encountered on clock change days in Cuba.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of ambiguous timestamps during conversion to UTC time zone, specifically when dealing with time bins on clock change days. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by adjusting how time bins are generated and labels assigned. This involves considering the time zone information and potential duplicated timestamps on clock change days.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    loc_index = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(self.freq.tz)
    local = loc_index.map(lambda x: x.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0))
    grouped = local.unique()
    group_offset = grouped.hour * 3600 + grouped.minute * 60 + grouped.second + grouped.microsecond/1e6

    bins = np.zeros(len(ax))
    for i, value in enumerate(ax.values):
        time = value.hour * 3600 + value.minute * 60 + value.second + value.microsecond/1e6
        bins[i] = np.searchsorted(group_offset, time)

    bin_edges = np.concatenate((grouped, np.array([grouped[-1] + self.freq])))
    binner = bins.astype(np.int64)
    
    labels = grouped[binner]
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, -1)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # If we end up with more labels than bins
    # Adjust the labels
    if len(binner) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(binner)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
- We address the handling of ambiguous timestamps and adjustments for clock change days.
- Compute the binning based on local time rather than UTC time.
- Properly assign labels to the time bins considering potential duplicates on clock change days. 

This corrected version should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue on clock change days during grouping operations related to time zones.
