### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module. It is supposed to handle time bins correctly, but due to a bug, it fails when encountering ambiguous timestamps.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a DataFrame with hourly data, converts the index time zone, then tries to group it by day frequency. This process results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling ambiguous timestamps incorrectly.
3. The error message indicates that the issue arises during the creation of the bins for time grouping and involves ambiguous time errors when encountering DST transition days.
4. The GitHub issue highlights this bug, pointing out that on days like Nov 4th in Cuba, midnight is an ambiguous timestamp due to the clock change causing the failure in the grouping operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the creation of bins for time grouping in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping time series data, especially on DST transition days like observed in the failing test.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Improve the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the generation of time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Ensure that the time range for grouping is created correctly to account for potential ambiguities in timestamps due to DST transitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    # Generate binner directly without ambiguity issues
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True,  # Ensure normalized date ranges
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Different handling for ambiguous times
    if len(binner) > len(np.unique(binner)):
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Summary:
By correcting the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensuring proper creation of time bins without ambiguity issues, the corrected `_get_time_bins` function should resolve the error encountered during time grouping on DST transition days. This fix aligns with addressing the GitHub issue related to this bug.
