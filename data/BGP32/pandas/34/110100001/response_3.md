## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for computing the time intervals for the resampling process. The bug seems to be related to the generation of time bins and labels, especially when dealing with timezone information.

## Potential Error Location
The error might be occurring in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. Additionally, handling of timezone information and NaN values might also be causing issues.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be related to the way timezone information is handled when creating the `binner` and `labels` arrays using `date_range`. The incorrect handling of timezone information might lead to incorrect binning and labeling, causing the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure proper handling of timezone information during the creation of `binner` and `labels`.
2. Verify the alignment of time bins and labels while taking into account timezone adjustments.
3. Check for correct handling of NaN values and ensure consistency throughout the function.
4. Make sure that the generated `binner` and `labels` have the correct length and alignment.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the mentioned issues:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring proper timezone handling and alignment of bins and labels, this corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
