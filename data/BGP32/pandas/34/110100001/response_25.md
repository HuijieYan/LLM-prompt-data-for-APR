## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. It then proceeds to calculate time bins based on the input `ax`.
3. The bug might be related to the calculation of time bins, particularly handling the closed end of the interval and label boundaries.
4. The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves downsampling a DataFrame by day and calculating the mean, but it seems to fail due to incorrect time bin calculations.

## Bug Cause:
The bug might be related to how the time bins are calculated, specifically when dealing with timezones, closed interval ends, and label boundaries. This could lead to incorrect binning and mismatched aggregations.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the time bins are calculated correctly based on the input `ax`.
2. Handle timezones properly during binning calculations.
3. Verify that closed interval ends are considered appropriately, especially in the presence of nanoseconds.
4. Confirm that label boundaries are set correctly to avoid mismatched aggregations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[: len(bins)]  # Adjust labels based on bin count
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to ensure that labels are correctly aligned with bins based on the closed end setting and handles NaN values appropriately. This should help in correctly generating time bins and passing the failing test.
