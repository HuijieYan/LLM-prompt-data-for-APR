### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex`, raises a `TypeError` if not, and then proceeds to calculate time bins and labels based on the input.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` when handling time-series data.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves creating a DataFrame from a time-series index with localized time zones and then performing resampling using `groupby`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of time zone localization or incorrect calculation of time bins and labels within the `_get_time_bins` function, which leads to incorrect results when resampling the data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of time zone information when creating `datetime` objects.
2. Verify the calculation of time bins and labels to accurately represent the resampling intervals.
3. Check for any potential issues with time zone conversions or adjustments during the resampling process.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, first, last)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = self._adjust_labels(ax, binner)

    return binner, bins, labels
```
Note: You may need to adjust the `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_adjust_labels` helper methods based on the actual calculations required for time binning and labeling. 

Ensure that the corrected `_get_time_bins` function handles time zones, bin edges, and labels accurately to pass the failing test.
