### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function takes a parameter `ax`, checks if it is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, and then performs a series of operations to get the time bins for the given axis.
3. The bug seems to be related to the mismatch between the length of `binner` and `labels`, as well as some potential issues with inserting `NaT` values when `ax.hasnans` is true.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of `labels` and `binner` when their lengths do not match. This can lead to errors later in the function when the lengths are assumed to be the same.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that `labels` and `binner` have the same length by modifying the logic appropriately.
2. Check for `ax.hasnans` while inserting `NaT` values into `binner` and `labels` to avoid potential issues.
3. Make sure to adjust the labels if the number of bins is less than the number of labels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()  # Ensure labels has the same length as binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Running the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should now pass with the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function.
