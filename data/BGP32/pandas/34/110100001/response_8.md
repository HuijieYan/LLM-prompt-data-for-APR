### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins()` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, performs some calculations to get time bins, and then returns `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`.
- The test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` is trying to test downsampling with daylight saving time changes at midnight.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug might be related to the incorrect generation of time bins and labels within the `_get_time_bins()` function, possibly due to issues with adjusting the bin edges and labels.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug could be caused by incorrect adjustments to the bin edges and labels, leading to mismatched or inconsistent binning of the input data, especially in scenarios involving time zone changes or daylight saving time adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, ensure proper adjustment of bin edges and labels based on the input data and the chosen frequency (e.g., '1D' for daily frequency).
- Double-check the calculations related to binning in different time zones or scenarios with daylight saving time changes to ensure correct grouping.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins()` Function:
You can try the following corrected version of the `_get_time_bins()` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed,
            label=self.label,
            convention=self.convention,
            ambiguous='infer',
        )

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax.asi8, ax.asi8,
            bin_edges=binner.asi8,
            closed=self.closed,
            hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        return binner, bins, binner
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to the bin edges calculation and uses the proper parameters for generating bins and labels based on the input data and the selected frequency.

By using this corrected version, the function should generate the correct time bins and labels, resolving the potential bug related to incorrect binning in the original `_get_time_bins()` function.
