## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins()` is designed to handle time interval grouping using a custom `TimeGrouper` class. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` as input and performs various calculations to determine time bins based on frequency, closed interval, label settings, and other parameters.

The bug in the code seems to be related to the calculation of `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes. Additionally, there might be an issue with the adjustment of labels when the number of bins is less than the number of labels.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect slicing and assignment of labels based on the values of `self.closed` and `self.label`. This causes an incorrect labeling of bins or labels when specific conditions are met.

When `self.closed == "right"`:
- If `self.label == "right"`, the labels should be shifted by one position.
- If `self.label != "right"`, no adjustment is necessary.

The bug triggers specifically when the condition `if len(bins) < len(labels)` is met, where the labels need to be adjusted according to the number of bins.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly adjust the labels based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes. Additionally, we need to ensure that the labels are adjusted correctly when the number of bins is less than the number of labels.

## Bug-fixed version of the code
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        while len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:-1]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts the labels correctly based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes and ensures that the labels are adjusted when the number of bins is less than the number of labels.
