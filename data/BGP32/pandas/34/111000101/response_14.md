### Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the incorrect generation of `first` and `last` timestamps, resulting in an error in the calculation of `labels`. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the generation of `first` and `last` timestamps to ensure accurate binning of the data points. 

Since the issue seems to be related to the handling of time zones and frequency offsets, we should focus on correctly setting the timezone and offsets for the timestamp range. Additionally, we need to address the calculation of `labels` based on the closed and label parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().ceil(self.freq)  # Using ceil to align with the frequency
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    # Adjusted the generation of first and last timestamps

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.shift(1)  # Adjust labels based on the closed parameter
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

This corrected version addresses the issue by adjusting the `first` and `last` timestamps using the `ceil` method to ensure proper alignment with the frequency. Additionally, it correctly adjusts the `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` parameters.
