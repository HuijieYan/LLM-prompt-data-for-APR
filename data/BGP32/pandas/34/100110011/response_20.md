### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is expecting the input `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`. Therefore, it checks the type and raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is attempting to group by a daily frequency in a timezone-aware `DateTimeIndex`. This grouping operation leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`, indicating a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change.
3. The error message specifically mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to convert a timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba where the midnight timestamp is ambiguous due to daylight saving time.
4. The GitHub issue provides a similar scenario where the expectation is to group the data by daily frequency while handling ambiguous timestamps caused by a clock change day.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by not handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in the `_get_time_bins` function, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by daily frequency in the failing test.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, especially during a clock change day. One solution could be to adjust the logic to account for ambiguous times when creating the bins or labels for daily grouping.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change
    # by adjusting the frequency to prevent AmbiguousTimeError
    if self.freq == "D":
        start = first.tz_localize(None).normalize()
        end = last.tz_localize(None).normalize()
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=start,
            end=end,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    else:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps during clock changes, the corrected `_get_time_bins` function should now be able to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` and pass the failing test.
