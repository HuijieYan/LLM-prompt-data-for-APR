### Analyzing the buggy function:
1. The `_get_time_bins` function checks if the axis is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if not.
2. It then proceeds to compute the `first` and `last` timestamps based on the `min` and `max` of the axis, which may cause an issue with nanosecond precision.
3. The function generates time bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` which may cause issues related to left/right closed bins.
4. There are adjustments being made to the `labels` and `binner` based on certain conditions which may not align with the expected behavior.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. Computing `first` and `last` timestamps.
2. The generation of time bins.
3. Adjustments made based on closed bins and specific labels.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the handling of timestamps near the end of a day containing nanosecond precision which can potentially affect the bins' alignment and lead to errors like `Values falls after last bin`. This results in the AmbiguousTimeError as observed in the failing test due to incorrect labeling of timestamps during daylight saving changes.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the computation of `first` and `last` timestamps preserves nanosecond precision.
2. Handle left/right closed bins appropriately to avoid potential errors in binning.
3. Adjust labels and binner based on the expected behavior of the bins.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Ensure nanosecond precision is preserved
    first = first.replace(nanosecond=0)
    last = last.replace(nanosecond=999999999)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, handle left/right closed bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    elif self.closed != "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if more than bins are present
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the nanosecond precision issue, proper handling of closed bins, and adjustments to labels based on the expected binning behavior. This version should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError encountered in the failing test scenario.
