### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for handling time binning and labels based on a given frequency.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` tries to down-sample data on a specific day spanning the daylight saving time transition, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The error occurs due to the handling of ambiguous time at midnight during a daylight saving time change.
4. The GitHub issue #23742 raised the same concern, which was seemingly fixed in version 0.24 but resurfaced in this scenario.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` signifies the issue on the daylight saving time transition day.
2. When converting time to the target timezone, it becomes ambiguous, leading to the error in binning the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix this bug, we should handle ambiguous times during the conversion to the target timezone explicitly.
2. We need to ensure that the data is correctly binned and labeled without causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Conclusion:
By explicitly handling ambiguous times during timezone conversion in the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the issue causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved. This fix ensures proper binning and labeling of timestamps, resolving the problem encountered during the daylight saving time transition.
