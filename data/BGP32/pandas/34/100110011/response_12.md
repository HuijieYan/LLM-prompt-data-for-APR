### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the file `pandas/core/resample.py` is responsible for generating time bins for a given DatetimeIndex. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group the data by day, and it encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a clock change on a specific day in Cuba where midnight is an ambiguous timestamp.

### Error Location in the Buggy Function
The error likely lies in the construction of the time bins using the `date_range` function because it fails to handle the ambiguity caused by the clock change.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the fact that the `date_range` function does not handle ambiguous times (like the midnight timestamp during a clock change). This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data by day during the clock change day in Cuba.

### Fixing the Bug
To address this bug, we need to modify the way the time bins are generated to handle ambiguous times correctly. One way to handle this is by specifically addressing the ambiguous midnight timestamp during the clock change, ensuring that the time bins are correctly set.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Handle the ambiguous midnight timestamp during the clock change
    binner = binner.insert(0, min(last, first) - unique_deltas(self.freq))
    labels = labels.insert(0, min(last, first) - unique_deltas(self.freq))

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "right" else binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle the ambiguous midnight timestamp by adjusting the `binner` and `labels` to include the midnight timestamp that's closer to the start time. This adjustment ensures that time bins are correctly generated without causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

This fix should address the bug and enable the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to pass successfully, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
