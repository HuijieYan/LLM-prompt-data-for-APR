### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is failing due to an error caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamp transitions during time binning. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when converting timestamps between time zones with ambiguous times.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the handling of ambiguous timestamps during time binning in the `_get_time_bins` function. When transitioning between time zones with ambiguous datetime information (e.g., during daylight saving time changes), the function does not handle the time conversion correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test tries to group data by daily frequency across a time period that includes a transition with ambiguous time (due to daylight saving time change in Cuba). When the timestamp is ambiguous and the time conversion between time zones is attempted, the function encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the incorrect handling of these transitions.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle transitions with ambiguous times correctly. This can be achieved by improving the time conversion logic and making adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamps during binning operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times during conversion
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the time conversion parameters such as `ambiguous="infer"` during the `date_range` call, we can handle ambiguous time transitions correctly and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during time binning operations.
