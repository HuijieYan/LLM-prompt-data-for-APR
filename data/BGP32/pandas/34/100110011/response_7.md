### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called during the execution of the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised during the execution of the test in `pandas/core/resample.py:1425` which is related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps such as during daylight saving time (DST) changes.
3. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problem related to daylight saving time handling, which was not resolved in version 0.24 of pandas.
4. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the usage of `date_range` which does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the DST change occurs on the midnight timestamp.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the `AmbiguousTimeError`, we need to modify the creation of the date range to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially around DST changes. This can be achieved by considering the timezone-awareness of the timestamps and ensuring that no ambiguous time points are created.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly when creating date_range
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        eu_dst=False  # Ensure DST rules are applied properly
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the creation of the `date_range` using `eu_dst=False` and handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, the corrected version of the function should now handle DST changes without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError` as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
