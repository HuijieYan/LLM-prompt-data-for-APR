### Analysis:
The error occurs when the `groupby` operation is performed on a DataFrame with a daily frequency that includes an ambiguous timestamp due to a time zone conversion. It leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`, as the code fails to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates the same problem and provides a sample code that triggers the error.

### Bug Location:
The error originates in the `_get_time_bins` function where the `date_range` is created without proper handling of ambiguous timestamps in time zone conversions.

### Cause:
The bug is caused by the method used to generate the date range for the time bins, where ambiguous timestamps are not handled properly. This leads to an error when performing groupby operations due to the ambiguous nature of certain timestamps during daylight saving transitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` generation includes proper handling of ambiguous timestamps to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This can be achieved by specifying the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function call.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="shift_forward",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps by shifting forward
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix, the `ambiguous="shift_forward"` parameter ensures that ambiguous timestamps are handled by shifting forward, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during groupby operations.

### Conclusion:
By updating the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during date range generation, the bug causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` is resolved, and the code should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
