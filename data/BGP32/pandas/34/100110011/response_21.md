### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test:

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` uses a date range with hourly frequency which involves a clock-change day in Cuba. This results in an ambiguous timestamp at midnight on that particular day. When calling `groupby` on this data, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the ambiguous timestamp issue.

### Identified potential error in the buggy function:
There is no handling for ambiguous timestamps or DST transitions in the `_get_time_bins` function which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised later during the data grouping process.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `date_range` function used in `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous time situations during clock changes. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data affected by this issue.

### Suggested bug-fix strategy:
1. Update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times during clock changes.
2. Adjust the generation of time bins to account for DST transitions.
3. Ensure that the function returns time bins that maintain consistency with the actual timestamps.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version that addresses the handling of ambiguous time situations:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent='shift_forward',  # Move back an hour during DST transitions
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins taking care of DST transitions
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure labels are compatible with bins length
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the way time bins are generated to consider ambiguous times and DST transitions, the corrected function should now handle the scenario described in the failing test effectively, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
