## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group data by day on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises from the fact that when creating the `binner` and `labels` variables using the `date_range` function, it doesn't handle the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the clock change day properly. This leads to the error during the groupby operation in the failing test.

The `date_range` function results in creating timestamps that are incorrect due to the daylight saving time change around midnight on the clock change day. This inappropriate handling of the time change results in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to account for the ambiguous timestamp issue on the clock change day in Cuba. One approach is to adjust how the timestamps are created and shifted to handle the daylight saving time change correctly on the clock change day. 

By properly managing the timestamp creation and adjustment, we can ensure that the labels for the grouped data are correctly assigned and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8.values.astype('int64'),
        self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = bins.searchsorted(np.arange(binner.shape[0], dtype='int64'), side='right')
    labels = binner[labels]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the bin edges and labels based on the behavior around the daylight saving time change, the corrected function ensures that the data is grouped correctly without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
