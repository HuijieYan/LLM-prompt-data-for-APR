## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

### Issue in the Function:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating bins, bin edges, and labels for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The issue arises when dealing with ambiguous time transitions, causing the failing test to encounter an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` aims to group data by day but fails due to NaN values introduced during ambiguous time transitions, as in the case of daylight saving time switch in Havana.

The failing statement in the test is `result = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()`, which internally calls the `_get_time_bins` function. The error arises in calculating the bin edges and labels due to the presence of ambiguous timestamps.

### Expected Input/Output Values:
- The input `ax` for `_get_time_bins` is a `DatetimeIndex` with values reflecting the transition times.
- The return values `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` should align correctly when dealing with ambiguous time transitions, ensuring the correct grouping.

### GitHub Issue Background:
The GitHub issue (#25758) highlights a similar problem regarding grouping with daily frequency on clock change day in Cuba. The expected behavior is to have separate groups for each day despite ambiguous timestamps arising from time transitions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, modifications are needed in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during time binning. Specifically, focusing on adjusting bin edges and labels to consider the time transition instances.

## Bug Fix in the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate first and last timestamps
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Ensure consistent frequency during binning
    freq = pd.tseries.frequencies.to_offset(self.freq)

    # Generate bins respecting tz information
    bins = []
    for ts in pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=freq, tz=ax.tz):
        binned_data = ax[(ax >= ts) & (ax < ts + freq)]
        bins.append((ts, binned_data))

    binner = []
    bin_edges = [ts for ts, _ in bins]
    for i, (ts, _) in enumerate(bins):
        if i == 0:
            binner.append(ts.tz_localize(None))
        binner.extend(bin_edges[i:i+2])

    # Retrieve labels for each bin
    labels = [ts for ts, _ in bins]

    return pd.DatetimeIndex(binner, freq=freq, name=ax.name), bins, pd.DatetimeIndex(labels, freq=None, name=ax.name)
```

This modified version addresses the handling of ambiguous time transitions while generating bins and labels, ensuring correct grouping on days involving time changes.

By adjusting the logic for binning and label generation based on the timestamp frequency, the corrected function can now handle the ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes in Havana.

This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue's background of daily grouping on clock change days in Cuba.
