### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to handle DateTimeIndex objects but encounters issues when handling ambiguous time in the context of a timezone, especially on clock-change days like in the GitHub issue.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of the timestamp on the day the clock shifts, which raises concerns about how the timestamps are being processed within the function.
3. The expected input parameters, types, and the desired output are clearly defined. The correction needs to address the handling of timestamps to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`, ensuring correct binning and labeling.
4. The strategy for fixing this bug involves refining the logic for timestamp adjustments during time bin generation, particularly addressing the ambiguity issue related to clock change days in specific timezones.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.
2. Ensure that bin boundaries and labels accurately represent the time intervals while considering timezone shifts and non-existent times.
3. Implement a more robust handling mechanism for timestamps, taking into account the timezone information provided.
4. The correction should enable the function to generate correct bins, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the test execution as described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use first/last directly instead of calling replace() on them
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, considering timezone shifts and non-existent times
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the handling of timestamps on clock change days, ensuring appropriate binning and labeling while avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`. It aligns with the expected input/output values and satisfies the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.
