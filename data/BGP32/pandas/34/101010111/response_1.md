### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`. However, in the failing test, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.
2. The failing test shows that the problematic timestamp is `2018-11-04 00:00:00`, which is ambiguous because the daylight saving time change occurs at that time.
3. The issue on GitHub describes a similar problem where the `pd.Grouper` fails on clock-change days like this.
4. The function tries to calculate the time range as bins but fails to consider the ambiguity during DST transitions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function uses a straightforward approach to create time bins, ignoring the ambiguous midnight timestamp on the clock-change day. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the conversion process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the DST transition issue explicitly. This fix involves adjusting the way the time bins are calculated, especially around the times of DST changes on clock-change days.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        # Create the first and last timestamps directly from ax.min() and ax.max()
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()

        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures that the time bins are correctly generated, considering the ambiguity during DST transitions. This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue and pass the failing test.
