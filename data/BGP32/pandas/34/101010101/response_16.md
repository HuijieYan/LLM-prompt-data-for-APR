### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when converting a `DatetimeIndex` with data localized to different timezones to daily frequency. The function attempts to create bins for grouping the data but fails to handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time correctly. As a result, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the presence of repeated times in the index, caused by the shift to daylight saving time.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle daylight saving time transitions correctly. This involves ensuring that the bin edges account for different timezone offsets and prevent the creation of ambiguous or repeated times resulting from the transition.

### Corrected Implementation
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Ensure proper localization before extracting start and end
    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz)

    first = ax_localized.min()
    last = ax_localized.max()

    binner_start = first.normalize().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    binner_end = last.normalize().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

    binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=binner_start, end=binner_end, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on the adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure labels align with bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures that bins are correctly determined even across time zone transitions, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from being raised. It accurately adjusts the bin edges to handle the time shift associated with daylight saving time changes.
