### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` in the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. This error occurs due to the method assuming that the provided start and end dates are not ambiguous in terms of daylight saving time, which is not always the case. The code fails to handle this ambiguity and raises the error.

The expected output provides clear insights into the expected values and types of variables at different stages of execution. Notably, the `start` and `end` dates in the failing test are ambiguous due to the presence of daylight saving time transitions, leading to the error.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `date_range` call within the `_get_time_bins` method. When creating the date range using potentially ambiguous start and end timestamps, the function does not handle the possibility of ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function can handle ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time transitions. One way to address this is by converting the start and end timestamps to UTC to avoid ambiguities related to time zones. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Code
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex")
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first.tz_convert(None),  # Convert to UTC to avoid ambiguity
            end=last.tz_convert(None),  # Convert to UTC to avoid ambiguity
            tz=None,  # Set timezone to None for ambiguous avoidance
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By converting the start and end timestamps to UTC within the `date_range` call and setting the timezone to None for ambiguous avoidance, the corrected code should now handle potential ambiguities related to daylight saving time transitions. This modification aims to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure the function behaves as expected in scenarios involving ambiguous times.
