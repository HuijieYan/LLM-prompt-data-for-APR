### Analysis:
The error message `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` indicates that there is an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps during the process of resampling.

The GitHub issue provides a clear explanation that the problem arises on a clock-change day in Cuba where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The bug has caused the resampling process to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Location:
The error seems to stem from the `_get_time_bins` function within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. Specifically, the function uses the `date_range` method to generate bins and labels, but it does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `date_range` method does not handle ambiguous timestamps that arise due to daylight saving time changes. This leads to the incorrect generation of bins and labels, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when resampling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the issue with handling ambiguous timestamps, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function accounts for these edge cases, especially on days where the clock changes due to daylight saving time transitions. This involves correctly handling the time zone adjustments during resampling.

### Corrected Function:
After analyzing the bug and its root cause, let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous='infer',
        nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous timestamps properly during the resampling process, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered in the failing test.
