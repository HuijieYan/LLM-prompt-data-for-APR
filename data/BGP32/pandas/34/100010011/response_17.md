### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group by a daily frequency during a clock change day in Cuba due to a missing handling of ambiguous timestamps. The issue on GitHub details the specific problem and the expected behavior.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug lies in the `_get_time_bins` function where the timestamp range is calculated for grouping. This function does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `date_range` function not handling ambiguous time properly when generating the bins for resampling. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group data with ambiguous timestamps.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `date_range` creation step to properly handle ambiguous times during clock change days. We can use a different approach to create the bins that can handle ambiguous timestamps without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version avoids the use of `date_range` to handle the binning process more effectively, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are properly accounted for during clock change days.
