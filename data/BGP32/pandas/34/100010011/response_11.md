### Analysis
The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised while trying to infer daylight saving time from a timestamp on a clock change day in Cuba. This is related to the `groupby` operation called in the test for downsampling with a daily frequency.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating the time bins required for resampling the data. The issue seems to arise when constructing the `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` due to the presence of ambiguous time on a clock change day.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `date_range` function is unable to handle the ambiguous time during the transition of daylight saving time. This leads to the occurrence of an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `binner` and `labels` are generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, an approach needs to be taken to handle the ambiguous time during the conversion between time zones. This can be achieved by providing a way to explicitly manage the datetime objects during the daylight saving time transition.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with a fix to handle the ambiguous time error during the daylight saving time transition in the provided example:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use the passed time zone directly for conversion to prevent AmbiguousTimeError
    adjusted_tz = ax.tz if ax.tz is not None else "UTC"
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=adjusted_tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly specifying the time zone during the `date_range` generation, we can prevent an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the daylight saving time transition. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
