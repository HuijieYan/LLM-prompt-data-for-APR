### Analysis:
The error message indicates an issue with handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba. The error occurs when trying to group by day using the `pd.Grouper` function. The function `_get_time_bins` in the buggy code is related to date range creation and it does not handle the ambiguous time error properly, leading to the raised `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba.
2. Inadequate adjustment of bin edges causing an issue when creating the date range.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the failure to handle ambiguous time correctly during the clock change day in Cuba. The `pd.Grouper` function raised the `AmbiguousTimeError` because the date range creation process did not account for the ambiguous timestamp, causing the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the creation of the date range to consider the ambiguous time. Additionally, proper handling of the ambiguous time should be implemented when creating the bins and labels.

### Updated Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Adjust bin edges to resolve ambiguous time issue
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by setting to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins while considering ambiguous time
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous='NaT'
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times by setting them to NaT and considering ambiguous time when generating bins, the corrected function should be able to handle the clock change day issue in Cuba and pass the failing test.
