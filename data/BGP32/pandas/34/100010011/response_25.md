### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` caused by daylight saving time changes in Cuba. The error occurs when trying to group data by day when there is an ambiguous time due to daylight saving time. The issue on GitHub highlights the same problem related to a clock change day in Cuba not being handled correctly by `pd.Grouper`.

### Bug Identification:
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function in the provided code. The error is caused by creating labels for daily bins that do not take into account ambiguous time on clock change days, leading to the error message mentioned.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time changes correctly. When creating daily time bins, if there is an ambiguous time (e.g., midnight on a clock change day), the code does not consider this scenario, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how daily time bins are created to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time changes. We can modify the logic to account for these situations and adjust the labels accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Update to handle ambiguous times by adjusting labels
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

By adjusting the behavior of creating daily time bins with ambiguous times handled appropriately, the corrected function should now be able to group the data correctly without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
