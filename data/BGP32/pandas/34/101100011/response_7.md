### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is failing to handle daylight saving time changes correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` in specific scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.
2. The issue arises due to incorrect labeling of the bins during daylight saving time transitions, which causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by daily frequency.
3. The test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` showcases the failure to correctly group data over multiple days with hourly frequency during daylight saving time changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of datetime labels in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. During daylight saving time transitions, the labeling logic does not account for the ambiguous time periods, leading to misalignment and the eventual error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve handling of datetime labels during daylight saving time transitions by ensuring that the bins are correctly labeled based on the transition time.
2. Address the issue of incorrect labeling during ambiguous time periods, especially at midnight when the clock changes.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + 1,  # Ensure the 'last' timestamp is included
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After updating the `_get_time_bins` function as described above, it should handle the daylight saving time transitions more accurately and align the bins correctly during ambiguous time periods. This correction should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and allow the test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to pass successfully.
