### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The function uses `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` functions from the same class.
3. The bug seems to be related to how time bins are calculated and adjusted, leading to incorrect labeling and handling of time ranges.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to handling daylight saving time issues in Cuba.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem related to handling ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect labeling and handling of time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function, which is critical for accurately grouping datetime data. This leads to incorrect labels and, ultimately, incorrect grouping in the presence of ambiguous timestamps like during clock changes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the time range edges are calculated correctly without losing nanosecond precision.
2. Adjust the time bins accurately based on the calculated edges.
3. Handle ambiguous timestamps, especially during DST transitions, to avoid errors and ensure correct grouping.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to inaccurate bin labeling and handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically during DST transitions.

After incorporating this corrected version, the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully, resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.
