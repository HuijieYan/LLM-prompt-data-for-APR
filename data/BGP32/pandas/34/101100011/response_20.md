### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating time bins for resampling in pandas.
2. The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates an issue with `pd.Grouper` failing when handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days like in the example of Cuba.
3. The GitHub issue `#23742` highlights a similar problem to the one mentioned in the failing test case, where `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when grouping with daily frequency.
4. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps causing `AmbiguousTimeError` in time bin creation during resampling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the time bins are correctly adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps by considering time zone information and avoiding loss of nanosecond precision.
2. Modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately and align with the expectations set by the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
3. Address the issue by adjusting the logic in `_get_time_bins` to prevent `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring during resampling with daily frequency in time zones like Cuba.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating the appropriate adjustments and considerations for handling ambiguous timestamps, the corrected function should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue when performing resampling with daily frequency in time zone-sensitive scenarios like the one mentioned in the failing test case and GitHub issue.
