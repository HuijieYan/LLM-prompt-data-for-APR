### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The bug is caused by not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on a long clock-change day like the one described in the GitHub issue. The code does not adjust for these ambiguous timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the section where the `date_range` function is used to create time bins. When transitioning from standard time to daylight saving time, the function does not account for the ambiguous timestamps on the clock-change day.

### Bug Cause:
The bug results from not properly handling ambiguous timestamps when generating time bins using the `date_range` function. Instead of adjusting for ambiguous timestamps, the code assumes a direct mapping which leads to incorrect binning.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The code needs to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.
2. Adjust the time bin creation process to handle ambiguity in timestamps correctly.
3. Ensure that the time bins reflect the actual time transitions on clock-change days.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    bin_edges = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(bin_edges, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, ensuring that the time bins are generated correctly. This fix should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Please replace the buggy function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file with this corrected version to resolve the bug.
