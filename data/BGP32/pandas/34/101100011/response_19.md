### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to datetime indexing and resampling in Pandas. It is called in the context of down-sampling time series data.
2. The function calls `_get_timestamp_range_edges` from the same file and `_adjust_bin_edges` from the same class `TimeGrouper`.
3. The bug is causing an issue when dealing with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` in certain cases, such as in the provided failing test.
4. The failing test specifically addresses the issue of the bug failing to handle daylight saving time transitions correctly in the context of time series resampling.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles ambiguous timestamps during time range creation and bin adjustment.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to how the function `_get_time_bins` is handling timestamps and generating bins for time series data. It fails to correctly consider ambiguous timestamps that arise during clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly by adjusting how time ranges are created and bins are generated. Specifically, special handling is needed for ambiguous timestamps to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` during this process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during time range creation and bin generation, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
