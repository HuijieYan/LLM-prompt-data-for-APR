## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if not.
3. It then proceeds to calculate the `first` and `last` values by calling the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
4. The subsequent code involves creating `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`, adjusting bin edges, generating bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`, and handling labels based on binning strategy.
5. The code also handles cases where `ax` has missing values.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The bug may be related to the conversion of time zones or the calculation of `first` and `last` values.
2. The binning process and label adjustment might be causing the issue.
3. Handling of missing values in `ax` could also lead to unexpected behavior.
4. The comparison of lengths for `bins` and `labels` may not be accurate.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug described in the GitHub issue pertains to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in Cuba. The failing test involves grouping data by day (`1D` frequency) in the Cuba time zone (`America/Havana`) and calculating the mean. On a day of a clock change where midnight is ambiguous, the `groupby` operation raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The bug in the buggy function `_get_time_bins` could potentially be linked to how it handles time zone conversions, edge calculations, and generation of bins. The erroneous handling of ambiguous timestamps due to the use of `date_range` and label adjustments likely causes the discrepancy.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time zone conversion and handling of ambiguous timestamps are done correctly. The binning process and adjustments to labels should accommodate ambiguous times appropriately to avoid errors related to the clock change in Cuba.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times with NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I made adjustments to handle ambiguous times by setting `ambiguous="NaT"` in `date_range`. This change ensures that ambiguous times are represented as `NaT` (Not a Time) to prevent errors during the binning process. Additionally, I kept the adjustments for labels based on binning strategy and addressed the handling of missing values. These changes aim to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test for downsampling in Cuba.
