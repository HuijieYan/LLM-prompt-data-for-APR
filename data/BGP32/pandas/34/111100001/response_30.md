### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class.
2. The function is designed to calculate time bins based on the input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug seems to be related to an incorrect adjustment of bin labels and bins in certain edge cases.
4. The bug may lead to incorrect generation of bins and labels when dealing with Datetime objects with nanosecond parts.
5. The bug is causing the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail due to incorrect bin and label generation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the use of `.insert(0, NaT)` to insert NaT values at the beginning of `binner` and `labels` arrays when `ax.hasnans` is True. This insertion causes the labels and bins to mismatch in length, leading to incorrect binning.
- Additionally, the adjustment of labels in the `if len(bins) < len(labels)` block does not handle the correct adjustment when there are more labels than bins.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Avoid using `.insert` for inserting NaT values at the beginning of `binner` and `labels` when `ax.hasnans` is True. This can lead to length mismatch between bins and labels.
2. Handle the adjustment of labels correctly when the number of bins is less than the number of labels.
3. Ensure that the bins and labels have the correct length and mapping.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        if len(labels) > 1:
            labels = labels[1:]
            binner = binner[1:]

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the issue with incorrect bin and label lengths should be resolved, and the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully.
