### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input datetime index `ax`.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment of bin edges and labels, which can lead to mismatched bins and labels in certain cases.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group data by a 1-day frequency, but due to the bug in `_get_time_bins`, the generated bins and labels do not match the expected output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function lies in the incorrect calculation and adjustment of bin edges and labels during the time grouping process. This incorrect adjustment can lead to discrepancies between bins and labels, especially when dealing with datetime indices with nanosecond precision.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in `_get_time_bins` function, we need to ensure that the bin edges and labels are correctly generated based on the input datetime index and the specified frequency. It is crucial to handle nanosecond precision correctly to prevent any discrepancies between bins and labels.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrections made in the function, the adjustment of bin edges and labels should now be handled correctly, ensuring that the generated bins and labels match each other during the time grouping process. The updated version should pass the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.
