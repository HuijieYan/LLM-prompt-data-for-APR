### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the given `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug might be related to the calculation of `first` and `last` time values, which are used to generate the time bins.
4. It seems like there might be an issue with the way `first` and `last` are calculated and then used to create `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges`.
5. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves time resampling and averaging, indicating potential issues in the time binning process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function could be caused by incorrect calculations of `first` and `last` when generating time bins. This affects the alignment of time bins, leading to incorrect grouping and averaging in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation of `first` and `last` accurately captures the time interval bounds.
2. Verify that the frequency and timezone information is appropriately handled when creating time bins.
3. Confirm that the labels and bins align correctly for the given time range.
4. Check for any shift or offset issues that might cause time misalignment in the bins.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        name=ax.name,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses potential issues with the calculation of `first` and `last`, ensuring proper alignment of time bins for accurate grouping and averaging. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
