## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which inherits from the `Grouper` class and is used for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of `first` and `last` values, which are used to generate date range bins, potentially leading to incorrect bins and labels.
4. The bug may be due to the usage of `replace()` method on `first` and `last`, which might not handle nanosecond parts properly.
5. The bin adjustments and label generation seem fine, but the calculation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` could be generating incorrect bins.
6. There is also a condition to adjust the labels if they are more than the bins, but it seems to be redundant and might cause issues.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid using the `replace()` method on `first` and `last` to retain nanosecond parts accurately.
2. Check the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function and ensure it correctly generates bins based on the input values.
3. Review the redundant condition for adjusting labels if they are more than bins and remove it if unnecessary.
4. Ensure that the date range bins and labels align correctly to avoid any discrepancies.
5. Test the corrected function with the failing test case to verify the fix.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By addressing the potential issues in the calculation of bins and labels, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function aims to pass the failing test case successfully.
