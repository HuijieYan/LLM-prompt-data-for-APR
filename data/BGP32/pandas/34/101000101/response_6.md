The bug in the provided function is related to how the bins are generated based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. The issue arises due to the incorrect calculation of `first` and `last`, leading to inaccurate binning.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` stems from incorrect calculations and assumptions about the start and end times of the bins. The handling of time zones, frequencies, and bin edges causes the issue in generating the correct bins for the given DatetimeIndex.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, which are essential for generating the correct bins later in the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps based on the given DatetimeIndex and ensure that the subsequent processing considers the time zone and frequency appropriately to generate the correct bins.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    if self.closed == 'left':
        first = first.floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max()
    if self.closed == 'right':
        last = last.ceil(self.freq)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses the issues with incorrect generation of `first` and `last` timestamps by floor or ceil based on the closed direction. It ensures that accurate bins are generated considering the time zone and frequency properly.
