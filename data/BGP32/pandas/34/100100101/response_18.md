### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to generate time bins based on a given `DatetimeIndex`, but it has a bug when adjusting bins and labels. The bug is likely causing incorrect binning and label assignment, leading to a mismatch in `bins` and `labels` lengths.

### Error location
The bug is likely located in the section where `bins` and `labels` are adjusted based on the condition `len(bins) < len(labels)`. This logic is intended to make sure that the length of `labels` matches the length of `bins`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the adjustment of `labels` based on the length of `bins` is incorrect. The trimming logic in `labels = labels[:len(bins)]` is flawed and leads to mismatched lengths in certain cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of `labels` based on the length of `bins` is correct. One approach is to make sure that we're only trimming `labels` when it's longer than `bins`, and if needed, we should trim `labels` from the beginning.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[len(labels) - len(bins):]  # Adjust labels correctly

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the `labels` correctly based on the lengths of `bins` in the last step of the function, we ensure that the function returns bins and labels of equal lengths. This correction should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
