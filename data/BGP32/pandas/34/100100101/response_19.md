### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing due to incorrect binning of timestamps causing a mismatch between the labels and bins.

1. The `date_range` function is used to generate `binner` and `labels` based on the start and end timestamps represented by `first` and `last`. However, there seems to be an issue with bin edges calculation that leads to misalignment with the actual data.
2. The condition for adjusting labels when the `closed` attribute is 'right' or when the `label` is 'right' needs to be handled properly.
3. The insertion of `NaT` in case of `hasnans` could also potentially affect the label alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. We need to ensure that the bin edges are properly calculated to match the timestamp data.
2. The adjustment of labels based on 'right' closure and label options should be validated.
3. Proper handling of `hasnans` to correctly adjust labels without affecting binning.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
        
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above in the corrected function, the issue causing the failure in the test case should be resolved.
