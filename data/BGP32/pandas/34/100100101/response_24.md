### Error explanation:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is an incorrect comparison in the condition for adjusting bin edges based on `ax_values` and `binner`. The issue arises in the line:
```python
if len(bins) < len(labels):
```
Since `labels` is modified earlier in the function by removing elements based on some conditions, the comparison to adjust labels based on the number of bins becomes inaccurate. This comparison should instead be based on the length of `ax`.

### Fix strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison for adjusting labels based on the number of bins should be corrected to compare with the length of the input parameter `ax` rather than `bins` to maintain consistency. This ensures that the labels are adjusted according to the correct number of bins.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels based on the length of ax
    if len(ax) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(ax)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

After applying this correction, the function should now adjust the labels based on the length of the input parameter `ax`, and the provided test should pass successfully.
