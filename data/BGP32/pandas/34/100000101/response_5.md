The bug in the provided function lies in the logic of adjusting the bin edges and generating bins. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of the bin edges and labels. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges and labels are adjusted correctly and that the bin generation is accurate based on the provided inputs. We also need to address the potential mismatch between the number of labels and bins.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function ensures that the bin edges, labels, and bins are adjusted and generated correctly based on the provided input parameters. It also handles the case where the number of labels and bins may not match. This version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
