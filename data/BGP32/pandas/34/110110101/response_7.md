### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called within the `TimeGrouper` class of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is designed to handle time interval grouping based on the frequency provided.
2. The error is occurring when trying to create time bins for resampling with a frequency of 1 day, mainly due to time zone conversions leading to ambiguous time errors.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, triggers an error due to ambiguous time conversion conflicts when attempting to group data by 1 day intervals that involve daylight saving time changes at midnight.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way time bins are adjusted to account for ambiguous times introduced by daylight saving time changes. Specifically, we need to handle the transition from one time zone offset to another at the boundaries of each day.
5. By adjusting the time bin edges based on the given conditions, we can ensure that time labels and bins align accurately without errors due to ambiguities in the timestamp.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that time zones are properly handled to prevent ambiguous time errors.
2. Adjust the time bin edges based on the given frequency and time zone.
3. Update the label generation to match the corrected bins.
4. Handle cases where ambiguous time zones are present to avoid errors during resampling.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Compute the start and end timestamps adjusted for timezone
    start = ax.min().normalize()
    end = ax.max().normalize() + Timedelta(days=1)
    
    if start == end:  # Handle cases where the timeline is within a single day
        end += Day()

    binner = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    labels = None
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

After applying this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, it should successfully handle ambiguous timestamp errors related to daylight saving time changes when performing resampling operations, resolving the issue encountered in the failing test case.
