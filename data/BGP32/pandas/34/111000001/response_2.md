## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function relies on the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function defined in the same file to calculate the first and last timestamps based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`.

## Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function may result in errors due to the behavior of NANoseconds while calling `replace()`. This could potentially lead to incorrect binning.
2. The logic for adjusting labels for the bins based on `self.label` and `self.closed` is not consistent and could lead to incorrect results.
3. The insertion of `NaT` values in `binner` and `labels` when `ax.hasnans` is True may result in incorrect labeling.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function could be due to the incorrect binning of timestamps and the misalignment of labels and bins, especially when dealing with NANoseconds. The insertion of `NaT` values when `ax.hasnans` is True further complicates the labeling process.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps to handle NANoseconds more accurately.
2. Refactor the logic for adjusting labels based on `self.label` and `self.closed` to ensure consistency and correctness.
3. Remove the insertion of `NaT` values in `binner` and `labels` when `ax.hasnans` is True to prevent incorrect labeling.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]  # Adjust labels if more than bins
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments include:
1. Removing the unnecessary insertion of `NaT` values when `ax.hasnans` is True.
2. Ensuring that labels are adjusted based on the correct conditions for `self.label`.
3. Keeping the label adjustment based on the length of bins for consistency.

The corrected version should handle the timestamp binning and labeling more accurately without introducing unnecessary errors.
