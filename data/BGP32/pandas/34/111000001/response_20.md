## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. This function is responsible for generating time bins based on a given `DatetimeIndex`. The function makes use of various operations like calculating the first and last timestamps, adjusting bin edges, generating bins, and adjusting labels.

## Bug Location:
The bug might be related to adjusting the labels when certain conditions are met. Specifically, when the `closed` attribute is set to `"right"`, and the `label` attribute is set to `"right"`, it seems there might be an issue with the adjustment logic.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug may be caused by the logic that adjusts the labels when the `closed` attribute is set to `"right"` and the `label` attribute is set to `"right"`. The adjustment for labels might not be correctly aligned in this scenario.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic related to adjusting the labels when the conditions `(self.closed == "right")` and `(self.label == "right")` are met. We should ensure that the labels are properly aligned with the bins based on these conditions.

## Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[:-1]  # Adjusting labels correctly
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[:-1]  # Adjusting labels correctly

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the correction, we made adjustments when setting `labels` based on the conditions of `self.closed` and `self.label`. This should ensure that the bins and labels are aligned correctly within the given conditions.
