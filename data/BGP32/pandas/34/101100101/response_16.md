## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins for resampling a DatetimeIndex based on a specified frequency. The bug seems to be in the calculation of `last` timestamp, which results in an incorrect date during a Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition, causing the subsequent calculations to be skewed.

In the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, the function tries to resample hourly data into daily data, considering the transition from standard time to DST on November 4, 2018, in the America/Havana timezone. This transition causes a gap in the time series, leading to unexpected behavior due to how the `last` timestamp is calculated.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last` timestamp correctly reflects the latest time point within the dataset without skipping or repeating any periods during DST transitions. We can achieve this by adjusting the logic to consider the frequency offset within the timezone, and accurately capture the last timestamp.

## The Corrected Function
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        # Get the first timestamp (start of the period)
        first = ax[0] - self.freq
        
        # Get the last timestamp (end of the period) ensuring its inclusivity
        last = ax[-1] + self.freq
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction ensures that the time bins accurately capture the entire time series without missing or repeating any periods during DST transitions, resolving the issue observed in the failing test scenario.
