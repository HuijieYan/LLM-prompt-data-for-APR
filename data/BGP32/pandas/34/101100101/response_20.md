### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins and labels for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The function seems to encounter a bug related to the comparison of timestamps based on frequency. This issue is likely causing incorrect binning of the data and resulting in failures during tests.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to originate from incorrect handling of the frequency during binning. The function fails to adjust the bin edges correctly when dealing with timestamps that include Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. This results in misalignment of bins and labels, leading to errors in the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges are adjusted properly based on the frequency, especially when dealing with Daylight Saving Time transitions. We should enhance the logic related to generating bins and aligning labels appropriately to avoid discrepancies in the output.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        ax_start = ax[0].floor(freq=self.freq)
        ax_end = ax[-1].ceil(freq=self.freq)
        
        binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=ax_start, end=ax_end, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
        labels = binner[1:] if self.closed == "right" else binner
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the frequency alignment issue and ensures proper generation of bins and labels for the input `DatetimeIndex`. It should now pass the failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.
