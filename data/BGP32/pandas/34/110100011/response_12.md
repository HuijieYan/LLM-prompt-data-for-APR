### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library, specifically in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
- The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`.
- The issue reported on GitHub involves handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight savings time changes, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The function currently fails in scenarios where the end of an interval contains nanoseconds and might lead to incorrect binning.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug arises in the generation of time bins when dealing with intervals that include nanoseconds. The `replace()` method used to adjust timestamps might omit the nanosecond part, resulting in potential errors.
- Additionally, the handling of ambiguous timestamps during daylight savings transitions is not handled correctly, leading to the reported issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To address the issue, the timestamps should be adjusted without losing nanosecond precision.
- Proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, such as in daylight savings transitions, needs to be incorporated to prevent errors.

### Correction of the Function:

```python
# Fixed version of the _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Directly using first/last without replace to preserve nanosecond precision
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Check and adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the timestamps without losing nanosecond precision and ensuring proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, the corrected function should resolve the reported issue and pass the failing test scenario outlined in the GitHub report.
