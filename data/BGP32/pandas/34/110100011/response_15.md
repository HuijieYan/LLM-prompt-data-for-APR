### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which inherits from `Grouper`.
- The function is designed to create time bins for grouping using the specified frequency, closed end, and label.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly during daylight saving time changes in specific timezones like Cuba.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during timezone conversion.
2. Inadequate adjustment of time bins and labels leading to mismatch.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when converting timezones, specifically during daylight saving time changes. The function does not recognize and adjust for the shift in the time index, leading to mismatched bins and labels causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous timestamps during timezone conversions. It involves adjusting the time bins and labels based on the timezone information to ensure that the grouping works seamlessly across different timezones.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        tz_local = ax[0].tz
        start = ax.min().tz_convert(tz_local)
        end = ax.max().tz_convert(tz_local)
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=start,
            end=end,
            tz=tz_local,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction includes properly handling timezone conversion for the time index to account for ambiguous timestamps and ensuring that time bins and labels are adjusted accordingly to avoid errors during grouping operations.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should address the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test scenario described.
