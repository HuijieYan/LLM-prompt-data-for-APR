### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for creating time bins for grouping based on the time index provided.
2. The buggy function is failing to correctly handle a specific scenario where there is an ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the issue by trying to downsample data with an hourly frequency on a clock change day in Havana.
4. The GitHub issue explains that on such days, midnight is an ambiguous timestamp, and the `pd.Grouper` does not handle it properly, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The expected output is to have three groups for each day without raising an error.
5. The bug seems related to handling ambiguous timestamps during time indexing transformation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the inability of the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on clock change days. This leads to inaccurate grouping of data and potential errors like `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially when converting time zones or encountering clock change days.
2. Adjust the binning logic to ensure that each timestamp is correctly assigned to the appropriate bin without any ambiguity.
3. Ensure that the labels and bins are aligned correctly with the actual data points based on the frequency and timezone information.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected version above, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, particularly on clock change days like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue. This will help in avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure proper grouping based on the time index provided.
