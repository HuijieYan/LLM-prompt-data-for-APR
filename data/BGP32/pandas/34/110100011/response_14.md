### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py`.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to perform operations like calculating `first` and `last` timestamps, generating bins, adjusting edges, generating labels, etc.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` for certain cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps while creating bins and labels.
5. The corrected version of the function should include a mechanism to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused due to improper handling of ambiguous timestamps when generating bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function.
- Specifically on clock change days in regions like Cuba, where there might be duplicate timestamps due to the time zone change.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for generating bins and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.
- Ensuring that the labels are correctly aligned with the actual time points in the datetime index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the first and last timestamps without losing nanosecond part
    first = ax.min().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    if first < ax.min():
        first = first + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    last = ax.max().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    if last > ax.max():
        last = last - pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    # Generate bins and labels considering ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on the datetime values without losing nanosecond part
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Corrected Function Explanation:
- The corrected function now handles ambiguous timestamps appropriately by considering clock change days and ensuring bins and labels align correctly with the datetime index.
- Proper adjustments are made to the `first` and `last` timestamps to avoid losing nanosecond precision.
- Bins and labels are generated in a way that accounts for ambiguous timestamps and operations like adjusting labels, handling NaNs are done accurately.

By using this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue on clock change days in regions like Cuba should be resolved.
