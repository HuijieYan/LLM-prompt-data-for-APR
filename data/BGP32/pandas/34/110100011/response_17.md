### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, and then performs various operations on it.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps around midnight during a clock change, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the issue by creating a `DataFrame` with hourly data across a daylight saving time change.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem occurring in Cuba but mentions that a related issue (#23742) was fixed in version 0.24, but this one is still present in version 0.24.2.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the function arises from how it handles ambiguous timestamps around midnight during a clock change, leading to incorrect labelings in the resulting bins.
- The function uses `date_range` to create bins based on the start and end timestamps, but it does not handle the ambiguity of timestamps around a daylight saving time change correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the resulting bins are labeled accurately.
- Specifically, we should address how the function creates and labels the bins around the start and end timestamps that are ambiguous due to daylight saving time changes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start, end = get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    labels = binner  # Reinitializing labels for clarity
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should address the issue with handling ambiguous timestamps around the clock change and pass the failing test scenario mentioned in the GitHub issue.
