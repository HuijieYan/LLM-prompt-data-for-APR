### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input axis is of type `DatetimeIndex`, raises a `TypeError` if it's not, and then proceeds to calculate time bins based on the input axis.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day, as described in the provided test case and GitHub issue.
4. The issue arises because the function fails to properly handle ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change, leading to incorrect grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on clock change days in time zones where such ambiguity exists, like in the case of Cuba. The function should be modified to handle these cases explicitly, ensuring that the data is grouped accurately without raising `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to make adjustments to the way time bins are calculated, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled properly.
2. We need to modify the logic to account for the possibility of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, adjusting the bin edges and labels accordingly.
3. By handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly, we can ensure that the grouping is done correctly without errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        ax_values = ax.dropna().asi8
    else:
        ax_values = ax.asi8

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Result:
The updated `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, ensuring that the grouping is done accurately even on clock change days in time zones like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and pass the failing test case.
