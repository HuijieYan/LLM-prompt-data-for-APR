### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class from the `pandas.core.resample` module.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins for a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug relates to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions, specifically in the context of grouping time series data.
4. The bug leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when dealing with ambiguous timestamps, causing the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail.

### Error Location:
The error is likely caused due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the code, where the function does not correctly account for the daylight saving time transition in Cuba.

### Bug Cause:
During a clock change day in a timezone like Cuba, the ambiguous timestamps are not handled correctly by the `pd.Grouper` object, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This causes the expected output to differ from the actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions is correctly implemented within the `_get_time_bins` function. This may involve adjusting how the time bins are generated and labeled to account for ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the issue related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions, allowing the provided test case to pass successfully.
