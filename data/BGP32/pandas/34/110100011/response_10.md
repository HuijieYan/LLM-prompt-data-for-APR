## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is used to generate time bins for grouping.
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping with daily frequency.
3. The bug is likely related to incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins for grouping.
4. The source code provided lacks proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during binning.

## Bugs Identified:
1. Incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the creation of time bins.
2. Lack of proper adjustment for ambiguous timestamps during binning.  
3. Failure to align timestamps with the local time zone when creating time bins.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect binning of timestamps during grouping, especially when encountering ambiguous time transitions, such as during clock changes. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during the creation of time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Adjust bin edges to align with the local time zone to avoid conflicts with ambiguous timestamps.
3. Update the binning logic to accommodate ambiguous time transitions and prevent errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz)  # Localize timestamps in the timezone
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_localized.min(), ax_localized.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax_localized.tz,  # Use the localized timezone
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during binning by localizing timestamps in the appropriate timezone and adjusting bin edges accordingly. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to grouping with daily frequency on clock-change days in Cuba.
