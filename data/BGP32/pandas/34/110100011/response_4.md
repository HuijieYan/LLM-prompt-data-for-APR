### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the given axis is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, raises a `TypeError` if not, and then proceeds to calculate time bins and labels based on the provided axis.
3. The bug relates to how the function handles situations where the end of the axis contains nanosecond parts, which can lead to errors in generating bins and labels.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` highlights the issue in handling daylight savings time changes in certain timezones, specifically in the context of Cuba timezone.
5. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem with the `pd.Grouper` functionality on a clock-change day in Cuba, where an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to how midnight is handled.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by how the function `_get_time_bins` handles situations where the end of the axis contains nanosecond parts.
- The incorrect handling can lead to the generation of bins and labels that do not account for ambiguous time situations during clock changes (like daylight savings time transitions).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the start and end timestamps used for generating bins and labels accurately capture the time range without losing nanosecond precision.
- Adjust the logic for generating bins and labels to handle ambiguous time situations more effectively, especially around midnight on clock-change days.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting how the start and end timestamps are used to generate bins and labels, the corrected function should handle daylight savings time transitions and ambiguous time situations better, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug and passing the failing test.
