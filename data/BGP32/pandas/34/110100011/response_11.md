### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for resampling. The issue seems to arise from the handling of ambiguous time during a DST transition, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function uses `date_range` to create bins which might lead to AmbiguousTimeError if not handled correctly.

### Identified Error Locations:
- Handling of ambiguous time during a DST transition.
- Potentially incorrect label assignment.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the improper handling of ambiguous time on clock change days as reported in the GitHub issue. When the DST transition occurs at midnight, it creates an ambiguous timestamp which leads to inconsistencies in label generation for time bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address how ambiguous time during a DST transition is handled. One approach is to ensure that the labels for time bins correctly account for the ambiguous time without causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous time correctly
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By including the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter while creating the date range for time bins, we ensure that ambiguous time during DST transitions is handled appropriately to prevent the AmbiguousTimeError.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the function to correctly create time bins for resampling, passing the failing test provided.
