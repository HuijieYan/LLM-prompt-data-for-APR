### Analysis
The provided buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue describes a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in Cuba. The issue is related to time zone conversions and daylight saving time adjustments.

### Identified Error Location
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may arise from how the function handles time zone adjustments and ambiguous timestamps, especially when dealing with day-light saving changes.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function may be causing issues when handling timestamps close to daylight saving adjustments. In the GitHub issue described, an error occurs when a timestamp is ambiguous, as in the case of a clock change day in Cuba. The function may not properly adjust for the ambiguity in timestamps during such transitions, leading to errors like AmbiguousTimeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly around daylight saving transitions. Handling timezone adjustments and ambiguous timestamps accurately will help resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels in case the number of bins exceeds labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the function properly adjusts for ambiguous timestamps and handles time zone conversions accurately, which should mitigate issues related to the handling of timestamps during daylight saving transitions.
