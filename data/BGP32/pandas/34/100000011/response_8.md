### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the pandas library and is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue mentions that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper`.

### Identified Issue:
The issue seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days. The error may occur due to the incorrect handling of timestamps when generating date ranges for grouping, possibly resulting in incorrect labeling and grouping of data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to arise from the incorrect handling of time bins when generating date ranges with ambiguous timestamps. This can lead to discrepancies in the grouping of data, especially on days like clock change days in Cuba.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of ambiguous timestamps is done correctly when generating the date ranges for grouping. It involves considering potential timezone conversions and adjustments to address the ambiguity of timestamps.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
  
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
      ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly while creating date ranges for grouping. It uses the floor and ceil functions to handle timestamps properly, especially in scenarios with potentially ambiguous timestamps like clock change days.
