### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The given buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the resample functionality in Pandas. The GitHub issue describes a problem related to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper`. The provided code in the issue reproduces this problem by creating a DataFrame with hourly data and then grouping it by a daily frequency, leading to the error on a clock change day.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function creates bins and labels using `date_range`. If these labels contain ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change, it might lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The adjustment of labels when the number of bins is smaller than labels may also impact the handling of ambiguous timestamps.

### Explanation of the bug cause using the buggy function and GitHub Issue information:
The `date_range` function used in `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating the bins and labels for the resampling process. When an ambiguous timestamp exists due to a clock change, the labels might not be handled correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The provided GitHub issue showcases a similar problem in a real-world scenario involving daily frequency grouping on a clock change day in Cuba.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `date_range` function is aware of ambiguous timestamps and can handle them appropriately.
2. Consider adjusting the labels and bins generation process to accommodate ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use date_range correctly handling ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Update the generation of bins to handle ambiguous timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous="infer"
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels correctly based on the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function incorporates handling of ambiguous timestamps by ensuring the `date_range` and bins generation processes can manage such scenarios effectively. This should help prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` in situations like the one described in the GitHub issue related to clock change days in Cuba.
