### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue describes a scenario where there is an AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` on a clock-change day in Cuba.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may be caused by the fact that it does not properly handle ambiguous time issues when constructing time bins.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely causing issues related to ambiguous times, as described in the GitHub issue. Specifically, the function does not handle cases where the time is ambiguous due to clock changes correctly. This leads to errors when trying to group the data with daily frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` should be modified to handle ambiguous times properly. This can be achieved by ensuring that the time bins are created correctly, taking into account the potential for ambiguous times during clock changes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The updated function now takes into account potential issues with ambiguous times, ensuring that the time bins are created correctly even on clock change days like the one in Cuba described in the GitHub issue. This should help resolve the AmbiguousTimeError problem when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency.
