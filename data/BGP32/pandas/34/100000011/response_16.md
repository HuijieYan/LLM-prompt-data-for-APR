### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue:

1. The GitHub issue described a problem with using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency on clock-change days in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue specifically mentioned a scenario on 2018-11-04, where a timestamp is ambiguous due to the clock change.
   
2. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in `pandas/core/resample.py` is responsible for creating time bins for grouping when resampling time series data. It involves handling time labels and generating bins based on the frequency and time range.

3. The bug could potentially arise from incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps or time-zone conversions, which are relevant to the GitHub issue since the problem is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.

### Error Location and Cause of the Bug:
The bug could be caused by the `date_range` function call inside the `_get_time_bins` function, where the `ambiguous` argument is set to `"infer"`. This setting might not correctly handle the ambiguous timestamps that occur due to clock changes, leading to errors when grouping data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function handles ambiguous timestamps properly, especially in scenarios like clock-change days. Updating the handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zones could resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set to NaT to avoid ambiguous time errors
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function is set to `"NaT"` to handle ambiguous timestamps by using `NaT` values instead of raising errors. This adjustment should help in avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` related to clock-change days as described in the GitHub issue.
