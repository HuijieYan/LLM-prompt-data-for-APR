### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue describes a scenario where there is an ambiguous timestamp due to a long clock-change day, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is using `date_range` to get the `binner` and `labels` for time bins, which might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. The adjustment of bin edges in `_adjust_bin_edges` might introduce errors when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.
3. Inserting `NaT` when `ax.hasnans` might cause issues when working with datetime indexes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to how it handles ambiguous timestamps or nanoseconds in the `DatetimeIndex`, especially when creating the bins and labels using `date_range`. Ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change day, as described in the GitHub issue, can lead to errors when creating time bins.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles ambiguous timestamps by adjusting the way bins and labels are created.
2. Check the adjustment of bin edges to make sure it aligns with ambiguous timestamps.
3. Review the insertion of `NaT` and how it interacts with nanoseconds and ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary libraries and classes

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to address the issue of handling ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating time bins within the `_get_time_bins` function. Further testing would be necessary to ensure that the function works as expected with the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue.
