### Analysis:
The issue on GitHub is related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically during a clock change day in Cuba. The problem arises when trying to group data based on daily frequency, causing an AmbiguousTimeError due to the presence of ambiguous timestamps.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of ambiguous timestamps during the conversion of datetime indexes.
2. Incorrect adjustment of bin labels when dealing with more labels than bins.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the creation of date_range with the option `ambiguous="infer"`. This ambiguity leads to errors when trying to group data based on daily frequency, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix this bug involves ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly during the creation of the date_range. Additionally, the adjustment of labels when dealing with more labels than bins should be revised to prevent errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="compliance",  # Change ambiguous handling to "compliance"
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()  # Fix to copy the binner for modification
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to `"compliance"` for handling ambiguous timestamps according to the standard time rules.
2. Corrected the adjustment of labels by copying `binner` before modification to avoid potential issues with the original labels.

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the AmbiguousTimeError during grouping with daily frequency.
