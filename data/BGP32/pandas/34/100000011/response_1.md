## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in `pandas/core/resample.py` is intended to create time bins for resampling a time series. The function is checking if the input axis is a `DatetimeIndex`, calculating the time range, generating bins, and adjusting labels based on the specified parameters.

The GitHub issue relates to `pd.Grouper` failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba due to handling ambiguous timestamps incorrectly, especially on a long clock-change day like November 4, 2018. This issue is similar to a previously fixed issue but seems to persist in version `0.24.2`.

## Identified potential error location:
The potential cause of the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function could be related to handling ambiguous timezones incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior during bin generation.

## Explanation of the bug:
The issue in the `_get_time_bins` function may be causing problems in handling ambiguous timezones, leading to unexpected behavior when generating time bins. This could result in errors like the one reported in the GitHub issue, where a clock change day in Cuba causes an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the time bins are generated correctly, taking into account ambiguous timestamps and handling timezones appropriately.

## Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tzinfo,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the timezone information from the input `ax` is correctly passed to the `date_range` function, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled appropriately. Additionally, adjustments for labels and bins are made based on the condition of timezone ambiguities.

By fixing the handling of timezones and ambiguous timestamps in `_get_time_bins`, the function should now generate time bins correctly without causing errors related to ambiguous time handling. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub related to `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping with daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba.
