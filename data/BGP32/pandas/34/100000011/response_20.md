## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue involves handling ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes. The function attempts to create time bins based on a given frequency and timestamp range but fails to handle situations where the timestamps are ambiguous, leading to errors like the one described in the GitHub issue.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function uses `date_range` to create time bins, which may not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. Adjusting the bin edges with `_adjust_bin_edges` might not account for ambiguous timestamps.
3. Handling labels and bins based on the closed interval may lead to incorrect results.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug in the current function arises from not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially in scenarios like daylight saving time changes. When time bins are created using `date_range` without considering the possibility of ambiguous timestamps, it can lead to errors when grouping data. This aligns with the reported issue of failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub, we need to ensure that the time bins are created in a way that handles ambiguous timestamps properly. This can involve considering time zone information, adjusting bin edges to account for such cases, and ensuring that labels and bins align correctly with the specified closed interval.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            f"axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering ambiguous timestamps
    bins, _, _ = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(labels) > len(bins):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, special care is taken to use `ambiguous="infer"` in `date_range` to handle ambiguous timestamp cases. Additionally, adjustments to bin edges and proper handling of labels and bins are ensured to align with the closed interval specified. This revised function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes.
