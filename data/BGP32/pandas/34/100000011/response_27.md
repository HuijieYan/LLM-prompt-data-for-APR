### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the issue on GitHub titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba". The issue describes a problem where the `pd.Grouper` function raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a long clock-change day in Cuba. This error is triggered when handling ambiguous time stamps, such as midnight on the clock change day.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conversion of timestamps between different time zones (`tz_localize` and `tz_convert`) may cause ambiguity in the timestamps.
2. The creation of date range with `date_range` might not handle ambiguous time stamps correctly.
3. Adjusting bin edges with `_adjust_bin_edges` may not account for ambiguous times.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function lies in how the timestamps are handled around ambiguous times, particularly during the clock change in Cuba. The function does not properly handle the transition from daylight-saving time to standard time, leading to unexpected behavior when generating bins and labels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the timestamps are handled consistently and correctly across different time zones.
2. Modify the creation of date range to handle ambiguous time stamps properly.
3. Adjust the bin edges considering ambiguous times during clock changes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, special attention is given to handling ambiguous timestamps, especially during the clock change in Cuba. The `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function helps to handle ambiguous times correctly. This adjustment should help resolve the issue related to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during groupby operations.
