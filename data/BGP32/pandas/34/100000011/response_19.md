### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue describes a problem where on a long clock-change day in Cuba, especially on November 4th, midnight local time becomes an ambiguous timestamp, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are when creating the DateRange `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. Specifically, on a day like November 4th in Cuba with a clock change, handling ambiguous timestamps can lead to errors.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the DateRange `binner` and `labels` are generated using the `date_range` function, especially when dealing with ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days like in Cuba. This can result in incorrect labeling and binning, leading to issues like the `AmbiguousTimeError` described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle ambiguous timestamps correctly when generating the DateRange `binner` and `labels`.
2. Adjust the logic to ensure that ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days are correctly identified and processed.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
- Ambiguous timestamps are handled by setting `ambiguous="NaT"` in the `date_range` call.
- The adjustments ensure that labels match the bins and handle cases where there are more labels than bins.

By making these adjustments, the function should be able to handle the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
