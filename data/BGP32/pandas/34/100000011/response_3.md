## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue regarding handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba. The issue arises when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency and encountering midnight local time, which is ambiguous due to the clock change.

## Error Locations:
1. The function is not properly handling the ambiguous timestamp issue on the clock change day, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The logic for adjusting bin edges and labels may not be considering the ambiguous timestamps correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly on clock change days in Cuba. The function does not account for the special case of ambiguous time at midnight during a clock change, leading to errors when processing the data using `pd.Grouper`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by adjusting the bin edges and labels appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function accounts for the special case of ambiguous time at midnight during a clock change in Cuba.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, additional handling for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days is added to ensure proper grouping with `pd.Grouper`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket regarding AmbiguousTimeError in Cuba.
