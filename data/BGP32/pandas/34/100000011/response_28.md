### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in `pandas/core/resample.py` is responsible for creating time bins based on a given DatetimeIndex. The issue reported on GitHub mentions a problem related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This issue arises due to the behavior of handling ambiguous times, specifically on clock change days during timezone conversion, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The function does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly during timezone conversion, leading to errors on clock change days.
2. There is an issue of mismatch between the number of bins and labels, especially when handling nanosecond parts.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during timezone conversion in the `_get_time_bins` function. When creating bins and labels for the time range, the function fails to adjust for ambiguous times that might exist during clock changes, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data on such days.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the code to handle ambiguous timestamps specifically on clock change days to avoid the error.
2. Ensure that the number of bins and labels match each other to prevent any mismatches.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax.min().normalize()
    end = ax.max().normalize()
    # Handle ambiguous times on clock change days
    if ax.tz is not None:
        start = ax.normalize()[0]
        end = ax.normalize()[-1]
    else:
        start = ax.min()
        end = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the adjustments as outlined in the corrected version of the function, the bug causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days should be resolved.
