### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to calculate binner, bins, and labels for time intervals based on the specified frequency and other parameters. However, due to a DST (Daylight Saving Time) issue, the `date_range` function is raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The issue arises from converting timestamps in the `date_range` function in local time, which can result in ambiguous times during DST transitions.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` operations on the input `DatatimeIndex` within the function. This leads to ambiguous times that cannot be inferred during DST transitions, hence causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Instead of localizing and converting the timestamps within the function, keep them in the original UTC format for calculations.
2. Ensure that the time bins and labels are generated based on UTC timestamps to avoid ambiguity during DST transitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert frequency to UTC
    freq = self.freq + "UTC"

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate binner based on UTC timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Calculate bins based on UTC timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By modifying the function to keep timestamps in UTC format during calculations, the DST ambiguity issue is resolved, and the function should now work correctly for the given test case.
