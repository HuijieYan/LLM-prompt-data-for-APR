### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an issue with handling datetime objects in time zones that have Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions at midnight (00:00). The error message specifically states that it cannot infer the DST time as there are no repeated times.

The function is designed to create time bins based on a given axis (`ax`) which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. It calculates `first` and `last` timestamps by calling `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. Then, it generates time bins between `first` and `last` using `date_range` and adjusts them accordingly.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function does not handle DST transitions at midnight correctly. The issue arises when the end of the range contains nanoseconds, leading to bins being slightly off. The function generating the time bins does not properly handle these cases, resulting in the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins generated correctly handle DST transitions at midnight by properly accounting for nanoseconds. One approach could involve modifying the logic around handling the nanosecond part in the timestamps to ensure accurate alignment of bins.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(freq=self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(freq=self.freq)  # Adjust ceiling to include all values

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the function, we adjust the calculation of the `last` timestamp to include all values up to the end by using `ceil` instead of directly setting it to `ax.max()`. This change ensures that DST transitions at midnight are correctly handled, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.
