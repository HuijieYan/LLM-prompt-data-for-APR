### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is used to calculate time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex. The error message indicates an issue with an ambiguous time during conversion which leads to the failure of the test case.

#### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. The function is not handling the daylight saving time (DST) transition correctly, leading to an ambiguous time error.
2. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` seems to be problematic.
3. The generation of `bin_edges` may not properly align with the transition between time zones with DST.

#### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the interaction between the calculation of time bins and the presence of ambiguous times caused by the transition between time zones with different offsets. This behavior is not properly handled in the current implementation, leading to the ambiguous time error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and prevent the ambiguous time error, we need to adjust the calculation of time bins to handle DST transitions correctly. This involves ensuring that the bin edges align properly with the transition points between different time zones.

#### Fixing the Bug
I will update the `_get_time_bins` function to address the DST transition issue by properly handling the time zone conversions and ensuring that the time bins are generated without encountering ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min().floor(self.freq), ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now properly handle DST transitions and generate time bins without causing ambiguous time errors. It aligns the bin edges correctly with the transition points and adjusts the time calculations accordingly.
