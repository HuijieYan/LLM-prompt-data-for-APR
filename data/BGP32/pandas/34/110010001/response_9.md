1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. This function is responsible for getting the time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The error message is related to `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` which occurs when there are no repeated times during the DST transition.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be related to the calculation of time bins, specifically in the `date_range` function call.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the DST transition during the date range creation process within the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message specifically mentions that it cannot infer the DST time due to no repeated times, which suggests that the issue lies in handling the transition.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the DST transition during the date range creation in a way that avoids ambiguous time. One approach could be to adjust the date range creation logic to ensure that the DST transition is handled correctly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Adding normalize=True to handle DST transition
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `normalize=True` parameter is added to the `date_range` function call to handle the DST transition and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. By adjusting the date range creation with normalization, we can ensure that the DST transition is properly handled within the time bins.
