1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which extends the `Grouper` class. The error occurs when this method is called during the grouping process in pandas, specifically when trying to group data with a frequency that may cause ambiguous time errors due to daylight savings time.

2. The potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` function are:
    - Using `date_range` function with parameters `ambiguous="infer"` which may lead to ambiguous time errors.
    
3. The bug is caused by using the `date_range` function in a way that doesn't handle ambiguous times properly. When the function tries to infer the ambiguity of a time range where a daylight savings transition is involved (e.g. transitioning from standard time to daylight savings time), it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we should provide a more explicit way of handling daylight savings transitions to prevent ambiguous time errors. We can do this by avoiding the use of `ambiguous="infer"` parameter and providing a clear direction on how to handle ambiguous times.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Avoid ambiguous time errors
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly avoids the use of `ambiguous="infer"` and uses `nonexistent="shift_forward"` to handle ambiguous times by shifting them forward. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring in cases where the time range includes ambiguous times due to daylight savings transitions.
