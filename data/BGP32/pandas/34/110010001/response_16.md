1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex.

2. Potential error locations within this function could be the calculation of `first` and `last`, adjustment of `bin_edges`, generation of `bins`, handling of `closed` and `label` parameters, and adjusting labels based on the number of bins.

3. The error message indicates a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` being raised due to the inability to infer DST time from a specific timestamp due to no repeated times. This error is occurring during the execution of the resampling operation on the provided DataFrame. It points to an issue with daylight saving time transition ambiguity.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of ambiguous times during the creation of the date range. This can be addressed by explicitly defining how ambiguous times should be resolved during the creation of the `binner` and `labels` date range. By setting the `ambiguous` parameter to a specific resolution strategy like `"NaT"`, ambiguous times can be handled more effectively.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handling ambiguous times by returning NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling ambiguous times with the `ambiguous="NaT"` parameter, the function should now be able to create the date range without causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
