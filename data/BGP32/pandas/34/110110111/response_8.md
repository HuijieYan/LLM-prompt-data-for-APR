### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class within the pandas library.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample data with a daily frequency on a day that contains an ambiguous time due to a clock change in Cuba.
3. The bug leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` because the code doesn't handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly.
4. The expected input parameters and output values are provided in the test case expected values section.
5. The GitHub issue #25758 reports a similar bug related to daily frequency failing on clock change day in Cuba.

### Bug Reason:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on days with a clock change. The code does not adequately address this scenario, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the down-sampling operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps properly on clock change days. Specifically, when creating the bins and labels, care must be taken to consider the ambiguous nature of the timestamps and account for it during the down-sampling process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last if self.closed == "left" else last + pd.Timedelta(1, unit=self.freq),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we adjust the end timestamp when generating the bins to handle the ambiguous time correctly on the day of the clock change. By adding an extra day if the interval is closed on the right, we ensure that all data points are correctly assigned to their corresponding bins. This adjustment should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and allow the down-sampling operation to proceed successfully.
