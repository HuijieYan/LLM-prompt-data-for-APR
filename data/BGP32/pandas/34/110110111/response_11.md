## Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, and then proceeds to process it to generate time bins for resampling.
- The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling of ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day in Cuba.
- The expected output is the resampling to provide three groups representing each day without errors.
- The buggy function fails to correctly handle the situation of ambiguous time stamps, leading to the error.
- The expected inputs and outputs for the function are provided for the failing test case.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises when dealing with ambiguous timestamps during resampling, specifically on clock-change days.
- The existing code does not handle the situation of ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during resampling.
- The error is triggered when converting the `DatetimeIndex` to a specific time zone for resampling, which encounters the issue of repeated times due to the clock change day.
- The code should provide appropriate handling for ambiguous timestamps to avoid this error and correctly generate the time bins.

## Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, the code needs to handle ambiguous times correctly by considering the repeated time scenario during resampling on clock-change days.
- A resolution involves adjusting how timestamps are handled, ensuring the correct creation of time bins without encountering repeated time issues and ambiguous timestamp errors.
- By adjusting the generation of time bins and ensuring appropriate labeling for each day without ambiguity, the bug can be resolved.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By handling ambiguous timestamps appropriately and adjusting the creation of time bins, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should successfully prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` during resampling.
