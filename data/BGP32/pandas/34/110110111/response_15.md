### Analysis and Bug Identification
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library.
- The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group the data by day, but due to a daylight saving time transition in Cuba, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised.
- The error indicates the issue is with ambiguous time on the clock change day (November 4th, 2018).
- The expected output should include three groups: one for each day - 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November.
- The function attempts to handle time bins using `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
- The issue was posted on GitHub with the title "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba."

### Bug Cause
- The bug arises due to the way the function handles ambiguous time (midnight on clock change day).
- The function doesn't properly account for the ambiguous nature of the time when generating the bins and labels.
- This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data by day on the clock change day.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The function needs to handle the ambiguous time at midnight on the clock change day properly.
- Ensure that the bins and labels are created in a way that considers the ambiguous time correctly.
- Adjust the bin edges and labels generation logic to account for the possible ambiguity during the daylight saving time transition.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    start, end = first, last
    if ax.tz._utc_transition_times and isinstance(ax.tz, DstTzInfo):
        transition_triggers = ax.tz._utc_transition_times
        for tt in transition_triggers:
            if start <= tt < end:
                end = tt
                break

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function now handles the ambiguous time issue that caused the `AmbiguousTimeError` on the clock change day in Cuba.
