### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is utilized within the `TimeGrouper` class, specifically for generating time bins for groupby operations based on specified frequency and time axes.
2. The error occurs during groupby operations involving daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba due to ambiguous timestamps at midnight, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, resulting in an inconsistency in binning the time intervals, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address how ambiguous timestamps on clock change days are handled within the `date_range` function to ensure proper binning of time intervals without raising `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the binning process to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly by considering the behavior of daylight saving time changes.
2. Adjust the creation of time bins to align with the expected output considering clock change days, especially at midnight, avoiding ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function addresses the issue by adjusting the way time bins are created, ensuring proper handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` during groupby operations.
