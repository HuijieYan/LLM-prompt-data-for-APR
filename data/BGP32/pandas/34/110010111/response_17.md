### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue:

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. It is associated with the `TimeGrouper` class and is used within the `pandas` library's resample functionality.
   
2. The Error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` which arises on clock change days in Cuba when a transition from daylight saving time (DST) to standard time occurs.

3. The expected behavior during the failing test execution is that the function should group the datetime index `ax` with a frequency of 1 day, handling the daylight saving time transition correctly to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The provided parameters and expected values/types reflect the correct operation of the function.

4. To address the bug, the issue arises during the creation of the datetime index using `date_range`. The date_range function does not handle the transition from DST to standard time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. We need to adjust how the index is created to account for this transition.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug and address the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba, we need to modify the creation of the `date_range` index in a way that handles the ambiguous times correctly, thereby avoiding the error. Specifically, we should adjust the behavior around the transition period during daylight saving time changes.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Added to handle normalization during DST transitions
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(binner) > len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(binner)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This version of the function includes `normalize=True` in the `date_range` call to handle normalization during the daylight saving time transition, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

By applying this correction, the function should now handle the transition from daylight saving time to standard time correctly on clock change days in Cuba, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
