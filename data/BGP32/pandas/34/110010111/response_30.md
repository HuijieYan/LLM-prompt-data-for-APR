### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which inherits from `Grouper`.
2. The error message indicates an issue related to ambiguous time during daylight savings time changes.
3. The expected input values include a `DatetimeIndex` with timestamps spanning a day before and after a daylight savings time shift, a `Day` frequency, timezone information, and flags related to time properties such as nanosecond and daylight savings.
4. The cause of the bug is related to handling ambiguous time during daylight savings transitions leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous times during daylight savings transitions more effectively.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Handle ambiguous time during daylight savings transitions by converting timestamps to UTC before generating bins.
2. Adjust the bin edges to include only non-duplicated timestamps.
3. Extend labels if `closed` is set to `'right'`.
4. Update labels to include NaN if necessary.
5. Adjust labels length if more labels are present than bins.
6. Ensure `NaT` is a `DatetimeIndex` type when appending to `binner` and `labels`.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert timestamps to UTC to handle ambiguous time during daylight savings
    ax_utc = ax.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert(ax.tz)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_utc.min(), ax_utc.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax_utc.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels length if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

By making the suggested changes, the function should now effectively handle ambiguous time during daylight savings transitions, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
