### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class that inherits from `Grouper`.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` while running a test involving the `groupby` operation on a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The expected input values consist of a `DatetimeIndex`, frequency, closed, label, and other parameters specific to grouping. The expected output includes `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`, all based on computed date ranges.
4. The issue in GitHub highlights the failure of `groupby` when dealing with ambiguous timestamps during clock changes in certain time zones.
5. The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during time zone conversions leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from how pandas handles DST transitions during time zone conversions on days with ambiguous timestamps, particularly in time zones like Cuba where there exists ambiguity around midnight during DST transitions. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`, the conversion logic for time zones needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. This can be achieved by explicitly handling the transition over ambiguous times during DST changes to ensure accurate labeling and binning of time intervals.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with modifications to handle ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function modifies the date range generation to explicitly handle ambiguous times during DST transitions, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensuring correct grouping of intervals.
