### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to handle time-interval grouping but fails on days with time change due to an ambiguous timestamp.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling a clock change, especially on the day of the time change.
3. The input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` with timestamps in a specific timezone and occurrences on a day with a clock change. The error is likely due to the ambiguous timestamp causing an issue in generating bins and labels.
4. The strategy to fix this bug involves improving the handling of timestamps on the day of time change to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of timestamps on a day with a clock change, especially at midnight.
2. The issue arises when creating bins and labels for grouped time intervals, leading to ambiguous timestamps.
3. The error message indicates a problem with inferring DST time on a specific timestamp due to repeated times.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` on days with clock changes, especially at midnight, handle the timestamp generation more robustly.
2. Ensure that the timestamps are adjusted correctly to accommodate the time change without ambiguity.
3. Modify the logic for binning and labeling on days with DST changes for accurate grouping.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="raise",  # Change ambiguous handling to 'raise'
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the handling of ambiguous timestamps during binning and labeling, we aim to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` on days with clock changes, ensuring accurate grouping for time intervals.
