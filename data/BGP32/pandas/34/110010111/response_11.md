### Analysis:
1. The `TimeGrouper` class contains the `_get_time_bins` function, which is responsible for handling time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input parameter `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, and if not, raises a `TypeError`.
3. The main issue arises when handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba, as indicated by the GitHub issue.
4. The function is expected to return `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` after processing the input `ax`.
5. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the `date_range` call, showing that the bug occurs during time handling.
6. The expected input parameters, values, and types are detailed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the `_get_time_bins` function not correctly handling the transition from standard to daylight saving time during a clock change day, specifically in the case of an ambiguous timestamp. This issue leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during time conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time handling accounts for ambiguous times correctly during clock changes. One potential strategy would be to adjust the logic in the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times appropriately, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the handling of time ranges in the `date_range` call and ensuring proper processing of ambiguous times, the corrected function should address the issue and pass the failing test case.
