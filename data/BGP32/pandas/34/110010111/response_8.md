### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which specializes in time-interval grouping.
2. The error occurs when dealing with time zone changes, particularly in the case of an ambiguous time stamp during DST transitioning in Cuba.
3. The error message `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` suggests a problem with handling ambiguous time stamps due to the transition from one DST to another.
4. The expected input parameters for the function are listed, along with the expected output types/values for different variables before the function's return.
5. The GitHub issue refers to the specific problem encountered during the grouping process around the DST transition in Cuba.
  
### Error:
The bug arises from the function not handling the ambiguous time stamp issue correctly during the `groupby` operation in the presence of DST transitions, as evidenced by the error message and the expected output mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
1. The issue involves handling ambiguous times due to DST transitions, so the function needs to address this explicitly.
2. To resolve the bug, the function should be updated to handle ambiguous times during DST transitions appropriately.
3. Using `pytz` functionalities or adjusting the time range calculations can help accommodate the ambiguity in time stamps.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import pytz

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    ...

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        ...

        # Handle ambiguous time stamps during DST transitions
        if ax.tz._dst at ax.min() != ax.tz._dst at ax.max():
            ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        ...
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction checks if the DST offset at the beginning and end of the DatetimeIndex `ax` is different, in which case it localizes `ax` to None temporarily. By indirectly resetting the time zone, the function handles the ambiguous time stamps during the transition correctly.
