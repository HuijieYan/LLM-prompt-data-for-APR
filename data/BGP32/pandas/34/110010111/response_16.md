### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.
3. The error message during the failing test indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling ambiguous timestamps.
4. The expected input values are a `DatetimeIndex` `ax`, with specific values and attributes, along with other class attributes like `freq`, `closed`, `label`, and `base`.
5. The bug seems to be related to handling daylight saving time changes in the timestamp range generated based on the input `ax`.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs when dealing with transitions between standard time and daylight saving time. In cases where there are repeated times due to a clock change (e.g., due to an ambiguous or non-existent time), the function fails to handle this situation correctly. This leads to ambiguity issues and the subsequent `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process for grouping.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamp range generation, binning, and labeling correctly handle scenarios where there are repeated times due to daylight saving time changes. We should modify the logic around timestamp range generation to handle ambiguous times appropriately and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0],
        end=ax[-1],
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed != "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes modifications to handle ambiguous times appropriately and align with the requirements for avoiding `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process. It ensures that repeated or ambiguous times are handled correctly without causing issues in the grouping process.
