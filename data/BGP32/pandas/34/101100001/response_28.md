## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating bins for resampling time series data. The bug seems to be related to the handling of datetime ranges when specifying the start and end for the bins. This results in mismatched labels and bins under certain conditions.

## Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the `date_range` function is used to create the bins and labels. There is an inconsistency in how the labels are adjusted based on the `closed` parameter and the `label` attribute.

## Bug Cause:
The bug can be attributed to how the labels and bins are generated using the `date_range` function without considering the corner cases involving the `closed` parameter and the `label` attribute. This inconsistency leads to incorrect alignment between labels and bins, causing the test case to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the labels are generated correctly based on the values of the `closed` parameter and the `label` attribute. We also need to ensure that any adjustments made to the labels are aligned with the bins to avoid mismatched lengths.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    # Generate bins and labels based on the specified parameters
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    labels = binner.copy()

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.label == 'right' and self.closed == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring that the labels and bins are generated consistently based on the `closed` parameter and the `label` attribute, the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
