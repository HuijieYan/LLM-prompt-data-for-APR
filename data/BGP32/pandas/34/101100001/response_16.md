## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`. The bug seems to be related to how the `binner` and `labels` values are being adjusted and used in the function.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when adjusting the `binner` and `labels` values in the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue arises when the condition `if len(bins) < len(labels)` is true, the labels get truncated to match the length of the bins. However, the labels should reflect the original `binner` regardless of the difference in lengths between the bins and labels, causing an incorrect adjustment and mismatch between the generated bins and labels.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the labels correspond to the original `binner` rather than being truncated based on the length of bins. This can be achieved by preserving the original `binner` values as labels and only adjusting if necessary, rather than trimming the labels to match the bins.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # Preserve original labels if more than bins
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = binner
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the bug related to adjusting labels based on the length of bins should be fixed. It ensures that the labels reflect the original `binner` values, maintaining the integrity of the time bins generated by the function.
