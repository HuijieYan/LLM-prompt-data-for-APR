After analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug is related to how the labels are handled in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The bug occurs when the labels are being adjusted based on the frequency and the closed side of the intervals.

The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the labels when the closed side of the intervals is "right" and the label is also set to "right". In this case, the labels need to be shifted by one position to align correctly with the bins.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the labels based on the closed side and label settings before returning them in the `_get_time_bins` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels
    labels = labels[:-1] if self.closed == "right" else labels
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the labels based on the closed side and label settings before returning them, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now pass the failing test and handle the labels correctly.
