## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to get the time bins for downsampling in the TimeGrouper class. The bug seems to be related to handling datetime indices when creating labels for the bins.

## Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to the creation of labels for time bins. The logic for handling labels and bins might be flawed, leading to incorrect bin assignments.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function might be caused by incorrect handling of labels and bins when creating time bins for resampling. This incorrect handling can result in mismatched bin assignments and labels, leading to failing tests.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the creation of labels and bins is done correctly when generating time bins for downsampling. We need to review the logic for creating labels based on the closed and label parameters to ensure they align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Bug Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label != "left":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the logic for assigning labels based on the `closed` and `label` parameters, and ensuring that the labels and bins are aligned correctly, we can fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
