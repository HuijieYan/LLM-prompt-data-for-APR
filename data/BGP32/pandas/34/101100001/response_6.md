## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to generate time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex` and frequency provided. The bug seems to arise from the incorrect labeling of bins due to a mismatch between the number of generated bins and labels.

## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the logic that adjusts the labels based on the number of bins. If the number of bins is less than the number of labels, the labels are incorrectly adjusted, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the case where the number of bins is less than the number of labels. When this happens, the labels are truncated to match the number of bins, leading to mismatched data.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly adjust the labels based on the number of bins generated. If the number of bins is less than the number of labels, the labels should only include the corresponding number of elements.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version includes a check to ensure that the labels are adjusted properly based on the number of bins generated. This fix should address the bug and make the function work correctly in the provided test case.
