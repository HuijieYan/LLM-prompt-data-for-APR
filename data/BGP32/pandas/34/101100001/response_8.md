## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins for grouping purposes. It takes a `DatetimeIndex` as input, calculates the bin edges, adjusts them based on the frequency, and generates the bins accordingly. The bug seems to be related to how the bin edges are adjusted and used to generate the bins.

## Identifying the Bug:
The bug can be identified in the following section of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

# general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
    ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
)
```
The issue may be related to how `bin_edges` are calculated and used in `generate_bins_dt64`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might occur because the adjustment of bin edges in `_adjust_bin_edges` method may not be aligning with `generate_bins_dt64`. This leads to incorrect bin generation, especially when dealing with timestamps that have nanosecond precision.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges adjusted in `_adjust_bin_edges` are consistent with the requirements of `generate_bins_dt64`, especially regarding nanosecond precision. We may need to review the calculation of bin edges and how they are used in the bin generation process.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner = binner.copy()
    bin_edges = binner.values
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By copying `binner` and converting it to values for `bin_edges`, we ensure that the adjustment of bin edges is correctly used in `generate_bins_dt64`, taking into account nanosecond precision. This should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly in generating time bins.
