### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The expected input is a `DatetimeIndex` object representing timestamps, along with some other parameters that determine the grouping behavior.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous time values, especially during clock changes as seen in the GitHub issue.
4. The bug arises because the function fails to properly account for the ambiguous timestamp during the clock change in Cuba.
5. To fix the bug, the function should handle ambiguous times by correctly labeling them and adjusting the bin edges accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the ambiguous timestamp during clock changes, particularly in the 'America/Havana' timezone.
2. Handle the ambiguous time by adjusting labels and bin edges to ensure proper grouping.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle ambiguous time situations as described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function accounts for the handling of ambiguous times during clock changes, as described in the GitHub issue. It adjusts the labels and bin edges accordingly to ensure proper grouping in such scenarios.
