### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for time-interval grouping. The issue seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in certain time zones.

### Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` where `min()` and `max()` of the timestamp range are used.
2. The generation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function which can lead to issues with ambiguous timestamps.
3. Adjustment of `bin_edges` based on the values in `ax_values`.
4. The insertion of `NaT` values when `ax` has NaNs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day. The timestamps for the start and end of the range are calculated using `ax.min()` and `ax.max()`, which may result in incorrect boundaries on clock change days. Additionally, the `date_range` function used to generate `binner` and `labels` might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Use `ax[0]` and `ax[-1]` to get the first and last timestamps to avoid potential issues with calculating the range on clock change days.
2. Consider using a custom approach to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately when generating `binner` and `labels`.
3. Ensure proper handling of `bin_edges` and adjust them based on the timestamps in `ax_values`.
4. Remove unnecessary insertion of `NaT` values and ensure correct matching of labels to bins.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + 1,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the issue related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days and produce the expected output values for the provided test case.
