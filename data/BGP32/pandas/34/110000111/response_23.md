### Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day. In the provided buggy function `_get_time_bins`, the issue arises when label construction fails to encompass the entire range due to the ambiguous timestamp. This leads to errors such as "Values falls after last bin" as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to handle the construction of bins and labels more accurately, considering the ambiguity of timestamps. Specifically, adjustments need to be made to correctly handle the timestamps during clock change days. 

### Bug Fix Implementation:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with the necessary adjustments made to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Adjust bin construction to handle ambiguous timestamps
    if last in ax:
        last -= pd.Timedelta(self.freq)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta(self.freq),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the construction of bins and labels to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, the corrected function should now effectively handle the grouping during a clock change day.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding groupby failures on clock change days in Cuba.
