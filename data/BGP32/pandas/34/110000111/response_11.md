### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` takes a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as input and performs calculations to determine the time bins, labels, and bins.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions the problem arising due to ambiguous time on clock change days, particularly in Cuba.
3. The issue involves handling ambiguous time during a clock change, which is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
4. The current implementation of the function may not account for the ambiguity in time during clock changes, leading to the reported error.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of ambiguous times during clock changes correctly. It fails to consider the transition points during clock changes in the specified time zone (`America/Havana` in this case). As a result, it can lead to errors related to ambiguous time calculations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the ambiguous time issue during clock changes, we need to adjust how the time bins, labels, and bin edges are calculated based on the specific requirements and properties of the time zone.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            "an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Ensure to take into account the timezone specifics and the handling of ambiguous times during clock changes to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.
