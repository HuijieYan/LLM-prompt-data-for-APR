### Analysis:
1. The `TimeGrouper` class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, inheriting from `Grouper`.
2. The `_get_time_bins` function performs calculations to determine the time bins for the given input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub (Issue #23742) describes a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, specifically in the context of Cuba's time zone (America/Havana).
4. The expected output should be three groups (one for each day: 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Location:
The error is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timezones during clock changes, specifically on the day when the time shifts due to daylight saving time adjustments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the time shift caused by the clock change in Cuba's time zone. This causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly, ensuring that the time bins are generated correctly, especially around the time shift due to the clock change.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    freq_offset = to_offset(self.freq)  # Convert frequency to a valid DateOffset
    first = ax.min().normalize()  # Normalize to midnight local time
    last = ax.max().normalize() + freq_offset  # Adjust for the frequency

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version explicitly handles ambiguous timestamps by normalizing the start and end times of the data and adjusting for the frequency offset. It also maintains the correct labels and binning logic to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping process.
