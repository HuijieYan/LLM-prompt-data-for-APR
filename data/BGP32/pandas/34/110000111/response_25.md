### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous time on clock change day. In the provided buggy function `_get_time_bins`, the settings for handling ambiguous time are not consistent with the expected behavior on clock change days. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when processing the input data that contains ambiguous timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time handling during clock change days is done correctly. Specifically, we should adjust the binning and labeling of time intervals to account for the ambiguity introduced by the clock change. This involves setting the time zone settings appropriately and adjusting the labels and bins based on the time range on clock change days.

### Corrected Function:
After analyzing the bug and understanding the context, below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    if isinstance(ax[0], Timestamp) and isinstance(ax[-1], Timestamp) and ax[0].tz is not None and ax[-1].tz is not None:
        first = first.tz_convert(ax[0].tz)
        last = last.tz_convert(ax[-1].tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of ambiguous time on clock change days by adjusting the time zone of the initial and final timestamps. Additionally, it ensures that the binning and labeling are done correctly on such days.

By applying this fix, the function will now correctly handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
