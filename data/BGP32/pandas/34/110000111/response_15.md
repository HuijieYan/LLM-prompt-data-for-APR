### Analysis:
The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps, especially during clock changes, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Error Locations:
1. The creation of `binner` and `labels` is not adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
2. Incorrect handling of `labels` when the `closed` parameter is set to `'right'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function not correctly dealing with ambiguous timestamps during time bin generation, leading to `AmbiguousTimeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` to handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
2. Ensure correct handling of `labels` based on the `closed` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Directly use first/last without replacing to retain nanosecond part
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins are generated
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamps properly and correctly consider the `closed` and `label` parameters.

By making these modifications, the function should now handle the described scenario of clock changes in Cuba without raising `AmbiguousTimeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.
