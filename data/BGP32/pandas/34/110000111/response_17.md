### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins and labels for groupby operations.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to calculate the time bins, labels, and other related values.
3. The issue arises on clock change days when there is an ambiguous timestamp, such as during Daylight Saving Time transitions.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the issue has similarities with a previously fixed issue in Pandas 0.24.
5. The problem seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during time bin generation.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs during the Daylight Saving Time transition day when there are ambiguous timestamps. The function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the time bins and labels are generated to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps during the Daylight Saving Time transition. One possible solution could be to explicitly handle the ambiguous times when constructing the bins and labels.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version explicitly handles ambiguous timestamps during the time bin generation process.
