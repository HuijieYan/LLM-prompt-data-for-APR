### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class from the pandas library.
2. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as input and performs various operations to generate time bins, labels, and bins.
3. The bug is related to handling the time bins on clock change days causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
4. The issue arises due to improper handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in specific timezones like 'America/Havana'.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the bin edges and labels properly to handle ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.


### Bug:
The bug occurs specifically on a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous. The function `_get_time_bins` doesn't handle this ambiguity properly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.


### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way bin edges and labels are generated to properly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. Specifically, when creating bins and labels for the time intervals, we need to ensure that the timestamps are correctly aligned with the timezone changes.


### Corrected Version:
```python
# import necessary libraries as mentioned in the question
import numpy as np

# Corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Generate the bin edges to handle ambiguous timestamps
    bin_edges = np.unique(np.concatenate((ax, np.array([last]))))
    binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=bin_edges, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bins = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we ensure to handle the ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by properly adjusting the bin edges and labels in a way that aligns with the timezone changes. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
