### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` has multiple steps including handling the input, calculating time bins, adjusting labels, and generating bins.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub describes a problem with ambiguous timestamp handling, specifically related to a clock change day in Cuba.
3. The bug causing the AmbiguousTimeError is likely due to incorrect handling of timestamps around the clock change day.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of ambiguous time stamps and ensure that the time bins, labels, and bins are correctly generated.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the implementation does not handle the situation of an ambiguous timestamp (due to a clock change) correctly. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError when generating time bins and labels.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. Specifically, we should adjust the logic related to time bin generation to ensure that ambiguous times are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use correct handling of ambiguous timestamps
    first = first.ceil(self.freq)  # Adjust first to avoid ambiguity
    last = last.ceil(self.freq)  # Adjust last to avoid ambiguity
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts the first and last timestamps to avoid ambiguity in the time bins, ensuring that the generated time bins are correct and aligned with the expected behavior around ambiguous timestamps.
