### Analysis:
The bug occurs due to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps correctly in the TimeGrouper class. In the provided test case, the TimeGrouper class fails to properly identify the boundaries on a clock-changing day in Cuba, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Location:
The bug originates in the `_get_time_bins` function where the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps is done based on the minimum and maximum values of the provided DatetimeIndex. This logic fails to account for the ambiguous timestamp case on clock-change days.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when computing the `first` and `last` timestamps for creating the binner and labels. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when processing timestamps that occur twice due to the clock change.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly handle the ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the binner and labels cover all the necessary timestamp intervals.
2. Adjust the logic for calculating the `first` and `last` timestamps to accommodate the ambiguous cases correctly.
3. Ensure that the bins, labels, and binner arrays are consistent with the provided DatetimeIndex.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function within the TimeGrouper class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    if self.closed == "left":
        last = last + 1  # Ensure inclusion of the last timestamp
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the ambiguity issue on clock-change days in Cuba by adjusting the timestamp range and considering the closed and label settings appropriately.
