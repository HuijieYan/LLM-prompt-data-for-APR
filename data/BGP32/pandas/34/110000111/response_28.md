### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` (which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`). The function then calculates `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` based on the given time range and frequency.
2. The issue reported on GitHub relates to the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days, specifically mentioning the case of Cuba with a long clock change day. The reported problem occurs when handling the transition between ambiguous timestamps.
3. The bug results from `date_range` usage, as it may incorrectly place the boundaries due to the timezone change causing an ambiguous timestamp, leading to incorrect grouping.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. To handle the AmbiguousTimeError correctly, the function should account for the ambiguous timestamps during timezone transitions.
2. Adjust the boundaries (`first`, `last`) by accurately reflecting the timezone changes during clock transitions for accurate grouping.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner, labels = ax, ax
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
        binner, bin_edges, labels = _generate_time_bins(first, last, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base, tz=ax.tz)

        ax_values = ax.asi8

        if self.closed == 'right' and self.label == 'right':
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bin_edges) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bin_edges)]

        return binner, lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans), labels

    def _generate_time_bins(first, last, freq, closed, base, tz):
        binner = date_range(freq=freq, start=first, end=last, tz=tz, closed=closed, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
        labels = binner

        bin_edges = PeriodIndex(binner, freq=freq)._period_instance_array
        return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

This corrected version now includes a new helper function `_generate_time_bins` to accurately handle the timezone changes and potential ambiguous timestamps, ensuring correct grouping even on clock change days like the one in Cuba.
