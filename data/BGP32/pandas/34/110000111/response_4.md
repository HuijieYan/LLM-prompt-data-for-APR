### Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `_get_time_bins` does not properly handle the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data by day. The specific issue is related to the handling of timestamps around the clock change.

### Error Location
The error is likely located in the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps along with the adjustment of `binner` and `labels` based on those timestamps, especially considering the existence of the `ambiguous` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps doesn't consider the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change.
2. The adjustment of `binner` and `labels` based on timestamps does not handle the ambiguous time properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` call might not be utilized effectively to resolve the ambiguity issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps to handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change.
2. Properly utilize the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` call to handle the ambiguity issue.
3. Ensure that the adjustment of `binner` and `labels` is done correctly considering the ambiguous time.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]  # Use the actual first timestamp directly
    last = ax[-1]  # Use the actual last timestamp directly

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous time as NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version properly handles the ambiguous time issue by adjusting the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps and utilizing the `ambiguous` parameter effectively. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data by day on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
