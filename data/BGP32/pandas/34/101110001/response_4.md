### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is responsible for getting the time bins for the resampling frequency.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with how timestamps are being processed, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test function is failing due to this error when trying to downsample the timestamp index.
4. The error is most likely related to the timestamp adjustment and binning process within the `_get_time_bins` function.
5. To fix the bug, the handling of time zones and ambiguous times needs to be improved to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that proper timezone handling is maintained throughout the process.
2. Address any ambiguity in time values during the binning operation.
3. Make sure that the frequency alignment of bins is accurate to avoid errors related to ambiguous times.
4. Correctly handle situations where there are repeated timestamps during daylight savings transitions.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
    # Fixed version of the _get_time_bins function
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(binner) < len(bins):
            bins = bins[:len(binner)]  # Adjust the bins if more bins than labels

        return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring proper timezone handling and addressing potential ambiguity in time values during the binning process, this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and pass the failing test.
