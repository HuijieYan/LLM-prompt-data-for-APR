### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is being called within the `pandas.core.resample.py` file by the `TimeGrouper` class, which is used in the resampling process.
2. It seems that the bug might be related to the handling of time zone conversions or localized datetime objects within the `_get_time_bins` function.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to resample a DataFrame to a daily frequency while dealing with ambiguous timezones during time zone conversion.
4. The specific error message `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` indicates that there is an issue with ambiguous time during timezone localization.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to originate from the time zone handling within the `_get_time_bins` function. To fix the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of ambiguous times during timezone conversion.
2. Potentially modify the logic when creating time bins to account for ambiguous time zones.
3. Adjust the logic to handle time zone conversions and ambiguous time issues properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz, # Preserve the timezone information
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer", # Handle ambiguous times during localization
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version focuses on handling the ambiguous time issue during timezone localization to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was encountered in the failing test.
