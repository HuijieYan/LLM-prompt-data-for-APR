### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in the process of downsampling time series data during resampling operations in Pandas.
2. The error message indicates an issue with ambiguous time during the conversion of time zones in the failing test.
3. The bug might be related to the handling of time zones or the generation of time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `date_range` function being used incorrectly in the `_get_time_bins` function. When converting the time index to a specific time zone (`tz=ax.tz`), there might be a situation where the operation encounters an ambiguous time (e.g., due to DST changes) that cannot be resolved correctly, leading to the mentioned error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how time zones are handled when generating the time bins to ensure that ambiguous time issues are properly resolved.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        tz='UTC'  # Set UTC time zone to avoid ambiguous time errors
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the time zone for the `date_range` function is explicitly set to UTC to prevent ambiguous time errors. This adjustment should help resolve the issue encountered in the failing test.
