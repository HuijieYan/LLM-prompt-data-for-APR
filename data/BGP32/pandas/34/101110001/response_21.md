### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. It is involved in creating bins for time grouping operations during resampling.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves resampling a DataFrame by day frequency which triggers the `_get_time_bins` function during the process.
3. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions while performing the resampling operation.
4. The bug is likely related to how the bins are created and labels assigned, specifically when dealing with DST transitions causing the error.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of DST transitions when generating bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. The function is not taking into account DST changes, which leads to mismatched time values and the `AmbiguousTimeError` during resampling for Day frequency.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bins and labels are generated with proper consideration for DST transitions, so that there are no ambiguous time values causing errors during resampling.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    bins = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = bins.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = bins[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = bins.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # make sure labels and bins are aligned
    if len(bins) != len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return bins, lib.convert_datetime_to_datetime64(bins), labels
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the bins and labels consider DST transitions by setting `ambiguous="infer"` in the `date_range` function. Additionally, we align the labels with bins to avoid potential errors. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test.
