### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to handle resampling of time bins. The provided test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` fails due to an AmbiguousTimeError in the context of a clock change day in Cuba (November 2018). The issue on GitHub highlights the exact problem and the expected behavior. The bug occurs due to how pandas handles AmbiguousTime during the resampling process. 

### Error Location:
The error lies in how the resampling is being handled on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The code does not consider the ambiguity of the timestamp correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function `_get_time_bins` does not account for ambiguous time during the resampling, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError in cases like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the resampling process needs to be adjusted to properly handle AmbiguousTime situations, especially on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This can be achieved by correctly handling the time labels and bins.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match bins length
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes handling of ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba, ensuring the resampling process works correctly in such scenarios.
