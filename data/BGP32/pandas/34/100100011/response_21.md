### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. The function seems to be failing in cases where the time index contains ambiguous timestamps, leading to an error when trying to group data.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is testing a scenario where there is a clock change in Cuba, causing ambiguous time stamps at midnight. The test tries to downsample the data based on daily frequency using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`, which ultimately leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `pd.Grouper` function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, and it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba.


### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous time stamps properly when generating time bins. This leads to incorrect labeling of time bins and causes issues when grouping the data based on these time bins, especially on days with daylight saving time changes.

The specific problem arises from the fact that `pd.date_range` is used to generate time bins without considering the potential presence of ambiguous timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on days with time changes. One approach could be to adjust the generation of time bins in such a way that it considers the existence of ambiguous timestamps in the input DatetimeIndex.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Consider normalizing ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By including `normalize=True` in the `date_range` call and considering other adjustments mentioned above, the corrected function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly and pass the failing test case related to the issue in GitHub.
