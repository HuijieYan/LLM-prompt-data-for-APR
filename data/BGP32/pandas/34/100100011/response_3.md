### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba." The issue arises when handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is a reproducible test case for this problem.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In handling ambiguous timestamps during the conversion of time zones.
2. In the logic related to binning time by frequency.
3. In the slicing and adjustment of labels and bins.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly on days with a time change in Cuba. The current implementation does not consider the ambiguity in the timestamps, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError during grouping.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, it is essential to explicitly handle ambiguous timestamps by considering the time change on the problematic day in Cuba. Proper handling of the transition between standard and daylight saving time is required to prevent the AmbiguousTimeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    ambiguous = "infer" if ax.tz and not ax.tz.dst(ax[0]) else None
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=ambiguous,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Summary:
By updating the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, specifically in the `date_range` call by setting the `ambiguous` parameter based on the timezone and daylight saving information, the bug related to AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba can be resolved.
