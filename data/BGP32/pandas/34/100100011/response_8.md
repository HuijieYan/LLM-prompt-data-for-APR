### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins()` is responsible for creating time bins for resampling operations. The function encounters a bug related to handling ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days. This bug results in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by time frequency.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug likely arises when handling ambiguous timestamps during time bin creation due to daylight saving time changes or clock adjustments.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inability of the function to properly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. Specifically, on the long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous due to the time change.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function `_get_time_bins()` needs to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, particularly on clock change days. Adjustments should be made to ensure that the time bins are created accurately without encountering the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins_fixed(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Correct handling of ambiguous timestamps
    if self.freq == 'D' and self.base == 0 and ax.freqstr != 'D':
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the function `_get_time_bins_fixed()`, adjustments have been made to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days. By adding conditional checks and modifications related to daily frequency and ambiguous timestamps, this fixed function should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by time frequency as observed in the failing test case.
