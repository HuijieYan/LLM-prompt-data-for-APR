### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the resampling process in `pandas` and is responsible for creating time bins for the resampling operation. The function checks if the input axis `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, and if not, raises a `TypeError`. It then proceeds to calculate the time bins based on the frequency provided.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample a DataFrame with hourly data into daily data on a day where there is a daylight saving time change, causing ambiguous timestamps in the time zone 'America/Havana'. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where the resampling fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba due to ambiguous timestamps.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises due to the handling of timestamps during resampling on days with ambiguous time zones. The function does not correctly account for the ambiguous time situation, leading to incorrect timestamp labels and potential errors during resampling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle ambiguous timestamps correctly by adjusting the logic for time bin creation on days with daylight saving time changes. Specifically, we need to handle the timestamps properly in the presence of ambiguous time zones.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        base=self.base,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Correction Explanation:
- Adjusted the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps to account for the full range of values.
- Included `closed=self.closed, base=self.base` in the `date_range` creation for proper handling of closed intervals.
- Modified the creation of `labels` based on the `closed` parameter and the logic requirements.
- Updated the index slicing for labels according to the `closed` and `label` parameters.
- The changes aim to correctly generate time bins for ambiguous timestamps on days with daylight saving time changes.

By applying these corrections, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test.
