### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in the context of resampling time series data. It is responsible for generating time bins and labels based on the input datetime index.
  
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves resampling hourly data into daily data using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`. The failing test occurs on a clock change day in Cuba where midnight local time is ambiguous, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
  
3. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where the `pd.Grouper` call raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock-change day in Cuba.

### Error Location:
1. The issue arises when creating the `labels` for the time bins. The code does not handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day correctly, leading to the error.
2. The `labels` are generated based on the start and end timestamps, which fails to account for the ambiguity in time on the clock change day.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `_get_time_bins` does not handle the timezone and daylight saving time transitions correctly when generating the labels for time bins. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` on a clock change day in Cuba.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the code to handle ambiguous time situations, especially on clock change days, by considering timezone information.
2. Ensure that the labels for time bins are generated in a way that accounts for possible ambiguities due to local time adjustments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure timezone information is retained
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguity in time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the function to handle timezone information and potential ambiguities introduced by daylight saving time transitions, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
