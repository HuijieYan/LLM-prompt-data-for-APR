### Analysis:
In this case, the buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in the context of resampling a DateTimeIndex, particularly dealing with daylight saving time (DST) transitions. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day, such as in Cuba.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely related to how the `_get_time_bins` function constructs the time bins for resampling. Specifically, the issue may arise due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions within the `date_range` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely occurs when the `date_range` function is employed to create bins from the start and end timestamps that are impacted by an ambiguous time, leading to incorrect resampling results and potentially raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, modifications need to be made to the `_get_time_bins` function when creating the time bins using `date_range`. It is crucial to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps and incorporate the necessary adjustments for DST transitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Adjusted handling of ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_back",  # Adjusted handling for non-existent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The adjustments made in the corrected version aim to handle ambiguous and non-existent times appropriately during DST transitions, addressing the issue of `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensuring accurate resampling results.
