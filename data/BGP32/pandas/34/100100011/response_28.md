### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in resampling operations within pandas. The issue reported on GitHub involves an AmbiguousTimeError occurring when resampling with a daily frequency on a day when a clock change happened (e.g., daylight saving time). This is related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps. The bug is causing the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail.

### Bug Identification
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the incorrect handling of AmbiguousTimeError for certain time zones and specific timestamps. The issue seems to arise when constructing the labels for the bins, causing the resampling operation to fail on days with a clock change.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of timestamps that fall on days with a clock change. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError as reported in the GitHub issue. The code does not account for days with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes, leading to incorrect labeling of the bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on days with clock changes. This may involve refining the way labels are constructed to consider the time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == 'right':
        if self.label == 'left':
            labels = labels[:-1]
    else:  # closed='left'
        if self.label == 'right':
            labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This version should correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError on days when clock changes occur, resolving the issue as reported on GitHub.
