## Analysis:
1. The `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas.core.resample` module is responsible for creating time bins based on the given datetime index.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not.
3. The function then calculates the first and last timestamps based on the min and max values of the datetime index. It uses `date_range` to create bins and labels based on the frequency, start, and end timestamps.
4. The function adjusts bin edges, generates bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`, and handles the labels based on the `closed` and `label` parameters.
5. There is a potential issue when adjusting labels if there are more labels than bins, which could lead to incorrect outputs.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when there are more labels than bins, causing the labels to be truncated incorrectly. This issue arises in cases where the length of bins is less than the length of labels, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the labels properly when the length of bins is less than the length of labels to ensure that both are aligned correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust the labels if the number of bins is less than the number of labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the labels properly when the number of bins is less than the number of labels, we ensure that the correct alignment is maintained. This fix should resolve the bug and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test case.
