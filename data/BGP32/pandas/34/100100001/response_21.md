The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of time bins and labels when dealing with Daylight Saving Time transitions. The issue arises when the `date_range` function is used to generate the bins and labels based on the start and end timestamps, leading to potential differences in the number of labels and bins if there are DST transitions within the time range.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the generation of bins and labels to handle DST transitions more accurately. One way to address this issue is to use the `resample` function in Pandas, which provides better support for handling time series data with DST transitions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = ax.to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp().to_numpy()
    binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=bins, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `to_period` and `to_timestamp` functions to handle DST transitions more accurately when generating bins and labels. This approach ensures that the number of labels and bins align properly, resolving the issue related to DST transitions.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully without any errors.
