### Analyzing the buggy function and error message:

The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an issue related to Daylight Saving Time (DST) when attempting to infer the DST time. This error arises when working with datetime indexes, causing an ambiguity in resolving the DST transition.

The error message originates from the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. Specifically, the datetime index is localized to UTC and then converted to another timezone, leading to a confusion in determining an ambiguous time due to DST transition.

### Potential error location and cause of the bug:

The bug is likely arising from the direct conversion of the datetime index to a different timezone without considering the potential for an ambiguous time. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time during the datetime range generation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To resolve this bug and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`, we need to handle the potential ambiguity caused by the DST transition. One way to address this is by explicitly specifying how to handle the ambiguous time during the timezone conversion, so that the conversion can accurately occur and avoid any DST-related errors.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with a fix to handle the potential ambiguity caused by DST transitions during timezone localization:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By including `ambiguous="infer"` in the `date_range` function call, we explicitly instruct pandas to infer the DST time in case of ambiguity and mitigate the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This correction ensures that the datetime range generation handles DST transitions correctly, making the function more robust and error-free.
