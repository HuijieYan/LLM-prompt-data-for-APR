1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py` is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the way it handles time binning using `date_range`. The error is raised when attempting to perform resampling involving a `DatetimeIndex` with localized time zones that have ambiguous times, such as during daylight saving time transitions.

2. The potential error locations within the method `_get_time_bins` that could be leading to the issue include the creation of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function without considering the ambiguous times.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that when creating the `date_range` for `binner` and `labels`, the function does not handle ambiguous times that may arise due to daylight saving time changes. This can lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised when attempting to perform the resampling operation.

4. To fix the bug, the strategy would involve adjusting the creation of `binner` and `labels` to handle ambiguous times more effectively, especially when converting between time zones or during transitions that result in repeating times.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Specify how to handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Specify how to handle nonexistent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By specifying `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` in the `date_range` call, the corrected function should now handle ambiguous and nonexistent times more appropriately during the binning process, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from being raised in scenarios like daylight saving time transitions.
