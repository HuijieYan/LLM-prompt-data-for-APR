### 1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The function is responsible for generating time bins using the `date_range` function, but encounters an issue on clock change days leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The related function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` is used to calculate the timestamp range, which might be causing the issue.
- The error message specifically points to the problem of ambiguity in DST transitions on clock change days.

### 2. Potential Error Location:
The issue of ambiguous time stems from how daylights saving time transitions are handled in the date range generation process, likely due to a shift in time leading to an ambiguous result.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `date_range` function being unable to handle ambiguous time during DST transitions, specifically on clock change days, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This arises due to incorrect labeling of time bins for the affected dates.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, it's necessary to adjust the generation of time bins on clock change days to avoid ambiguity. This can involve explicitly handling the duplicate or ambiguous times by specifying the behavior during such transitions.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Ensure inferred behavior for ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle nonexistent times by shifting forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we specifically address the ambiguous and nonexistent times during DST transitions by setting the appropriate behavior in the `date_range` function parameters. This adjustment should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring on clock change days.
