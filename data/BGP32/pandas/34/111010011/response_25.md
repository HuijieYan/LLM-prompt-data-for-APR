### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The function is responsible for creating time bins and labels for the data based on the frequency provided.
- The bug seems to be causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling of timestamps during conversion to localized time with daylight saving time considerations in the context of timezones with DST changes like Cuba.
- The error message suggests that on November 4th, there is an ambiguous timestamp issue causing the error.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to the way timestamps are handled around midnight on the day of the clock change (daylight saving time).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to have a special handling for ambiguous timestamps, especially around midnight on the day of the clock change to resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    fixed_tz = ax.tz if ax.tz else 'UTC'  # Make sure we have a timezone to avoid ambiguities
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=fixed_tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The correction includes setting a fixed timezone to avoid ambiguities around midnight on the day of the clock change, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` by ensuring proper handling of timestamps. This fix ensures that the timestamps are adjusted correctly, and the grouping operation should now work as expected for time intervals, especially around DST changes.

After applying this fix, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved during the `groupby` operation on daily frequency with time zone conversion.
