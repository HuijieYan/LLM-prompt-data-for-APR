### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module. The purpose of this function is to generate time bins based on a given DatetimeIndex.

The error message provided is an `AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs when DST (Daylight Saving Time) transition results in a repeated time in the local time zone. This error is caused during the creation of the bins using the `date_range` function, due to handling of ambiguous timestamps.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that on the date of the clock change in Cuba (2018-11-04), the code fails to group the data correctly.

### Error Locations
1. The error may be related to the ambiguous timestamps when creating the bins using the `date_range` function.
2. The handling of the time labels and bins for the grouped data may not be adjusting for DST transitions.
3. The code does not consider the possibility of repeated times during the DST transition.

### Bug Cause
1. When generating the time bins using `date_range`, the code encounters an ambiguous time during the DST transition in Cuba, leading to a `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The code does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, causing the grouping to fail on the date of the clock change.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the creation of time bins to handle ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions.
2. Update the code to correctly label and adjust the bins when encountering repeated times.
3. Consider the TZ-localization and conversion during date range creation to deal with ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = ax
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate a series of periods as bins to handle AmbiguousTimeError
    binner = labels = PeriodIndex(
        data=date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name),
        freq=self.freq
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by using `PeriodIndex` to handle ambiguous timestamps and generating the bins accordingly. It adjusts the bin creation process to consider repeated times during DST transitions, thus resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
