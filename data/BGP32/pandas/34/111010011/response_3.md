### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. The function `_get_time_bins` within the class `TimeGrouper` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` which must be a `DatetimeIndex`. 
   
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised due to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps in the context of a clock change day in Cuba.

3. The GitHub issue specifically mentions the problem arising on a clock change day in Cuba, where the midnight timestamp is ambiguous. The error is triggered when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Identified bug and cause:

The bug stems from the fact that when generating the date range to create bins, the original implementation of `date_range` which is used to create `binner` and `labels` does not properly handle ambiguous time due to a clock change.

In the Cuban timezone, on the day of the clock change, a timestamp such as midnight could be ambiguous, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The `date_range` function and subsequent operations on `binner` and `labels` do not consider this ambiguity issue, causing the error.

### Suggested fix strategy:

To handle the ambiguous time issue, we need to ensure that the date range generation for `binner` and `labels` considers and properly handles ambiguous timestamps during the clock change. Adjustments need to be made to generate the date range accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Adjust binner based on the presence of ambiguous time
    binner = binner.shift(freq=self.freq)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the `binner` to shift the ambiguous time appropriately, we can handle the issue of ambiguous time during the clock change on the specific day in the Cuban timezone.
