### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which inherits from the `Grouper` class. The buggy function is responsible for getting the bins for time grouping based on the frequency and other parameters.
   
2. The error message mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised due to an issue in handling the ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba. This issue involves converting timestamps from UTC to a specific timezone causing the error.

3. The bug is likely occurring when creating the `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` with an ambiguous timestamp. The error is related to handling the timestamp with daylight savings time changes, specifically when transitioning from standard time to daylight saving time.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` in such a way that it correctly handles timestamps with daylight saving time transitions.

### Bug Fix:
To address the issue related to the ambiguous timestamp on clock change day, we need to modify the way `binner` and `labels` are created using `date_range`. We can handle the ambiguous timestamp scenario by specifying a param to tackle ambiguous times.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Correcting the creation of binner and labels to handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adding the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` call, we ensure that ambiguous times are handled correctly during the creation of `binner` and `labels`.

This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping operation in scenarios like clock change days in Cuba.
