### Analysis:
The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised due to an issue related to handling time zones and daylight saving time on specific clock-change days like in Cuba. The error occurs during the grouping operation using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

Looking at the GitHub issue, it is described that the expected behavior should be to return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should contain the hourly data points for that day, including the ambiguous timestamp at midnight.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file. When creating the date range to form bins, use of `date_range` with time zone information and datetime that might be ambiguous causes the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a strategy involving handling ambiguous times on clock-change days is required. One possible approach could be to explicitly handle the ambiguous parts of the date range during the creation of bins. This might involve capturing and correctly representing the ambiguous timestamps in the bins without error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method with additional handling for ambiguous times:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        # Handle the ambiguous timestamp
        if ax.is_normalized:
            # Handle ambiguous time by shifting forward
            for i in range(1, len(labels)):
                if labels[i] == labels[i-1]:
                    labels = labels.insert(i, labels[i] + self.freq)  # Shift forward by the frequency
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]  # Match the labels with bins

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes handling for ambiguous timestamps by shifting them forward by the frequency of the date range if the timestamps are repeated in the labels.

By implementing this additional logic, the corrected function should now be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps during bin creation without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
