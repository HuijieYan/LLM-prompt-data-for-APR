### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, responsible for time-interval grouping.
   
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError`, implying an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day.
   
3. The function tries to create a `DatetimeIndex` based on the provided frequency and timestamp range, leading to errors on clock change days.
   
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the exact scenario with code that triggers the bug, expecting three groups for each day but encountering the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the naive creation of index labels within `_get_time_bins` function, causing problems on clock change days when timestamps are ambiguous.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by handling ambiguous timestamps more carefully. One approach could be to explicitly set the ambiguous time resolution during label creation.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas import NaT
import pytz

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # Previous function definitions...
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        # Creating DatetimeIndex with accurate resolution
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq, 
            start=first, 
            end=last, 
            tz=ax.tz, 
            name=ax.name, 
            ambiguous=pytz.AMBIGUOUS,  # Explicitly handling ambiguous times
            nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # Continuing with the remaining code for label adjustment...
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter for `date_range` function is set to `pytz.AMBIGUOUS` to explicitly handle ambiguous times, thereby resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
