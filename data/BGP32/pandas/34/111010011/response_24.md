### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping defined in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function attempts to calculate time bins based on input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`. The issue arises when dealing with ambiguous timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The corresponding error message is related to a failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, where the test case involves creating a DataFrame with hourly data covering a period that includes a clock change day in Cuba. The goal is to group the data by daily frequency, but due to ambiguous timestamps during the clock change, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised.

The GitHub issue #25758 highlights a similar problem where grouping with a daily frequency fails on clock change days in certain time zones, like Cuba.

### Identifying potential error locations

The error seems to originate from the conversion of timestamps using `date_range` and handling ambiguous times incorrectly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue arises when dealing with timestamps like midnight during the clock change.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the logic for handling ambiguous times in the `_get_time_bins` function is not correctly implemented. When creating the `date_range` for binning, handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time in the context of an ambiguous timestamp (like midnight during the clock change day) is not effectively managed. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for creating the `date_range` to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps during clock changes. One approach could be to adjust the boundaries of the bins and labels based on the timezone information to avoid ambiguous times. 

### Correction for the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert(None)
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By properly handling the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue should be resolved.
