### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` is a method inside the class `TimeGrouper`, which is a subclass of `Grouper`.
2. The function calls `_get_timestamp_range_edges` from the same module to calculate `first` and `last`, which are used for generating `binner` and `labels`.
3. The error message suggests an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps on the day of a clock change in Cuba.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights a problem where `groupby` fails with `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba, indicating that the error is specific to certain time zones on clock change days.
5. The problem is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a time change, and the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly that arise due to daylight saving time changes, like the one in Cuba on the day mentioned in the GitHub issue. The error message specifically mentions the issue related to an ambiguous timestamp on a day with a clock change.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in `_get_time_bins` to properly handle ambiguous timestamps that occur due to daylight saving time changes. This can involve adjusting the calculation of `binner` and `labels` to account for the specific scenario of ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins`:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Directly using first/last to avoid losing nanoseconds during time adjustments
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Deal with non-existent times by moving forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of `_get_time_bins` includes the necessary adjustments like handling ambiguous times and moving forward in case of non-existent times. By modifying the logic, the function should now properly handle scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue where the error occurred.
