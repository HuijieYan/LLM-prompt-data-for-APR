## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised due to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock-change day in Cuba.
3. The error is related to the failure of the `groupby` operation on a DataFrame with a daily frequency, causing the failure in handling ambiguous timestamps.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that this bug results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba and the expected output is missing due to this bug.
5. The issue was similar to another issue (#23742) but remained unresolved.
6. The expectation is to have three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) with the specific labeling for the ambiguous timestamp (midnight on the clock-change day).
  
## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly on clock-change days. The use of `date_range` to generate bin edges is causing the issue, as it does not handle ambiguous or non-existing timestamps appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps during clock-change days in Cuba correctly. This can be achieved by adjusting the creation of bin edges using a different approach to handle ambiguous or non-existing timestamps appropriately.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.to_pydatetime(),  # Convert to Python datetime for explicit handling
        end=last.to_pydatetime(),  # Convert to Python datetime for explicit handling
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly converting the `first` and `last` timestamps to Python `datetime` objects before creating the bin edges, we ensure that the ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue on clock-change days in Cuba.
