## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins()` is designed to generate time bins based on the given DatetimeIndex `ax`. It performs various operations such as adjusting bin edges, generating bins, adjusting labels, handling NaNs, and ensuring consistency between bins and labels.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function directly accesses the properties of `ax` without proper validation, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `binner` and `labels` are modified within the function, which could cause inconsistencies.
3. Handling of NaN values in the `ax` and labels may not be correctly implemented.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function could arise from improper handling or manipulation of the `binner` and `labels` variables along with the potential inconsistent manipulation of bin edges and labels. Additionally, the handling of NaN values in `ax` and labels may lead to errors.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the input `ax` to ensure it is a DatetimeIndex before proceeding with further operations.
2. Ensure that modifications to `labels` and `binner` are carried out consistently and accurately.
3. Properly handle NaN values in `ax` and labels to prevent errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the input `ax` is validated and proper handling of `labels` and `binner` is ensured. The modifications are performed consistently, and NaN values are handled appropriately.
