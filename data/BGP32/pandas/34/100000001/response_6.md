1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_get_time_bins` is intended to create time bins for resampling data based on a DatetimeIndex. It checks the input `ax` to ensure it is a DatetimeIndex and then proceeds to calculate the time bins. However, there seem to be errors in handling the labels and bins resulting in potential issues when returning the binner, bins, and labels.

2. Potential error locations:
- Calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
- Adjustment of bin edges in `_adjust_bin_edges` method.
- Generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
- Handling of labels and bins based on the `closed` and `label` attributes.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect adjustments to the labels and bins during the process of creating time bins. Specifically, issues with index alignment or slicing might lead to mismatched dimensions between labels and bins, resulting in incorrect results when resampling the data.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that the labels and bins are correctly aligned and have the same dimensions before returning them from the function. This involves properly adjusting the bin edges, generating bins accurately, and aligning the labels correctly based on the `closed` and `label` attributes.

5. Corrected version of the function `_get_time_bins`:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax[0], ax[-1], self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels if necessary to match bins length
    if len(binner) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(binner)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I modified the handling of first and last timestamps, adjusted the alignment of labels and bins, and ensured proper slicing to match the dimensions. Additionally, I corrected the indexing of `ax` to obtain the first and last values for calculating the time range.
