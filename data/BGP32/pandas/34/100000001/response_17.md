### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins used for resampling operations in Pandas. The function expects the input `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex` object. It calculates the time bins based on the frequency and range of the input `ax`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function uses the `date_range` method to calculate the `binner` and `labels`, which could lead to errors related to frequency, start, and end points.
2. The adjustment of bin edges in `_adjust_bin_edges` could potentially introduce errors as well.
3. The handling of labels and bins based on the `closed` and `label` parameters could be problematic.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function could stem from incorrect calculations of time bins due to the incorrect handling of `binner` and `labels` creation using the `date_range` method. The adjustments made to bin edges and labels based on `closed` and `label` parameters may also affect the correctness of the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `date_range` method is used correctly to calculate the `binner` and `labels` with the appropriate start and end values.
2. Verify the adjustments made to bin edges and labels are accurate based on the `closed` and `label` parameters.
3. Handle edge cases such as NaN values in the input `ax` to prevent errors.


### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

In the corrected version, the `date_range` method is used with corrected parameters to calculate the `binner` and `labels`. Additionally, the adjustments made to bin edges and labels are based on the `closed` and `label` parameters. Also, edge cases like NaN values handling are considered to ensure correctness.
