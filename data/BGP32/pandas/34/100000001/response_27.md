## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the pandas library's `resample.py` file is meant to create time bins for resampling time series data. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, calculates the time range, adjusts bin edges, generates bins, and handles various labeling scenarios. The bug seems to be related to adjusting labels when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug may be in the logic where labels are adjusted when the length of `bins` is less than the length of `labels`.
2. The insertion of `NaT` values in the `binner` and `labels` may also be problematic.
3. The handling of labels based on the `closed` and `label` attributes might lead to incorrect labeling.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins due to the adjustment made based on the condition `len(bins) < len(labels)`. This can lead to mismatched dimensions and incorrect labels being associated with the bins.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the number of labels matches the number of bins. Adjustments to labels should be made properly without losing data. Additionally, the insertion of `NaT` values needs to be handled correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version provided above:
- Labels are adjusted appropriately based on conditions related to `closed` and `label`.
- The insertion of `NaT` values is retained and applied correctly.
- The adjustment of labels to match the number of bins is done with the `len(bins) < len(labels)` condition being handled properly.
