### Analysis:
The buggy `get_time_bins` function is intended to generate time bins based on a DatetimeIndex. The function seems to be designed for resampling or binning time series data. Yet, there are several potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed.

### Bugs:
1. The function uses an attribute `asi8` on the `ax` object, which seems to be incorrect as there is no defined attribute `asi8` in the `DatetimeIndex` class from the given imports.
2. The function attempts to modify the `binner` and `labels` objects by inserting `NaT` values, which is likely to cause issues as lists/arrays are used for binning and labeling, not `DatetimeIndex` objects directly.

### Strategies for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the incorrect usage of `asi8` attribute with a proper method or attribute from `ax` to obtain the integer representation of timestamps.
2. Modify the way `binner` and `labels` objects are adjusted to align with the correct structure expected by the function.
3. Ensure that the output remains consistent with the expected behavior of a function that generates time bins.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Generating bins
    bin_edges = pd.to_numeric(binner)
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        bin_edges, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=pd.isna(ax).any()
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if pd.isna(ax).any():
        binner = DatetimeIndex([NaT], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name).append(binner)
        labels = DatetimeIndex([NaT], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name).append(labels)

    # Adjusting labels if more than bins available
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I replaced the incorrect usage of `asi8` attribute with `pd.to_numeric` to obtain the integer representation of timestamps for bin edges. I also corrected the adjustment of `binner` and `labels` by restructuring them as `DatetimeIndex` objects. Additionally, changed the handling of `NaT` values for `binner` and `labels`.
