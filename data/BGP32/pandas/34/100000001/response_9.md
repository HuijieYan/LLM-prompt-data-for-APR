The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins for resampling purposes. The bug in this function lies in the condition where the number of labels exceeds the number of bins due to incorrect handling of inserting NaT values.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the section where NaT values are inserted into `binner` and `labels` if `ax.hasnans` is true. The issue arises when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins, resulting in a mismatch.

### Bug Cause:
When inserting NaT values at the beginning of the `binner` and `labels` lists, if the length of `labels` is greater than the length of `bins`, there is no check to ensure that the number of labels matches the number of bins. This results in an inconsistency between the two, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the number of labels matches the number of bins before inserting NaT values. Additionally, we should handle the insertion of NaT values in a way that maintains the integrity of the bins and labels.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        num_nats = len(labels) - len(bins)
        if num_nats > 0:
            binner = binner.insert(0, [NaT] * num_nats)
            labels = labels.insert(0, [NaT] * num_nats)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we check the difference in lengths between `labels` and `bins` when inserting NaT values and adjust accordingly. Additionally, we modify the handling of labels when `self.closed == 'right'` to ensure consistency. This corrected version should address the bug and prevent the mismatch between bins and labels.
