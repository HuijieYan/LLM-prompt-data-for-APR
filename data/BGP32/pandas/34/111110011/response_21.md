### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is being called as part of the grouping process in the failing test.
2. The error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from [date]` indicates an issue related to handling ambiguous time during daylight saving changes.
3. The bug arises when trying to resample a time series around the ambiguous time caused by daylight saving time changes.
4. The incorrect labeling and binning of the time indices lead to the error.
5. The GitHub issue #23742 is related to a similar problem, but it was not fully fixed in version 0.24.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the binning and labeling creation in the `_get_time_bins` function to avoid ambiguous time errors.
2. Ensure that the date range is generated correctly considering the timezone offset and ambiguity.
3. Properly adjust the labels based on the closed and label parameters.
4. Update the function to handle potential daylight saving time issues.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex([], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last + self.freq, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels + self.freq
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making these changes to the `_get_time_bins` function, the corrected version should address the ambiguous time error related to daylight saving time changes and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
