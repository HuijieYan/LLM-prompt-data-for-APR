### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to generate time bins based on the input `ax`, which should be a `DatetimeIndex`. It calculates the start and end timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and then creates date ranges based on those timestamps.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous times during Daylight Saving Time transitions, specifically mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` triggers the bug when attempting to group a DateTimeIndex by a daily frequency in a timezone with ambiguous timestamp due to a DST transition. The error message clearly states the issue with ambiguous times on the clock change day.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous times appropriately during the date range creation to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. The suggested fix involves checking for ambiguous times during the creation of date ranges and handling them accordingly based on the timezone.

### Bug Fix:
```python
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times in date range creation
    if np.any(binner.index.duplicated()):
        start = binner.index[0]
        binner = binner[1:]
        labels = binner.copy() if self.label == "right" else binner[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling duplicated indices (ambiguous times) in the date range creation, we can prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` during DST transitions. This updated function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the test case to pass successfully.
