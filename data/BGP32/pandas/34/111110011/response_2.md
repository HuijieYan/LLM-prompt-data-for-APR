### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is failing during the test due to the AmbiguousTimeError caused by handling timestamps with a clock change in Cuba.
- The error occurs when using `date_range` to create bins on a clock-change day in Cuba, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The issue arises because of the inaccurate labeling of the bins due to the handling of DST transitions.
- The call to `groupby` in the failing test triggers the bug when attempting to group data according to a daily frequency that includes timestamps affected by DST changes.
- The corresponding error message indicates that the AmbiguousTimeError is raised, preventing the grouping operation from completing successfully.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inaccurate handling of timestamps during DST transitions, leading to AmbiguousTimeError when creating bins with `date_range` using local time information on clock-change days in Cuba.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should adjust the way the bins are created on clock-change days to handle the AmbiguousTimeError. This can be achieved by ensuring the accurate assignment of labels to bins, especially when dealing with timestamps affected by DST transitions.

### Correction:
```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = labels = Index([NaT], name=ax.name)
        bins = [NaN] * len(ax)
        return binner, bins, labels

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Ensure proper labeling on clock-change days to avoid AmbiguousTimeError
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous handling
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins with accurate handling of timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the outlined corrections in the `_get_time_bins` function, handling DST transitions accurately, the bug causing the AmbiguousTimeError on clock-change days in Cuba can be successfully addressed.
