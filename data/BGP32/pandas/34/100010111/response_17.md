## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an inability to infer daylight saving time from a timestamp on November 4th, 2018, at midnight in Cuba.

The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The problematic code is when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. The issue arises because the conversion process leads to ambiguous time on days when there is a switch due to daylight saving time.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `date_range` function's handling of ambiguous timestamps on days when the daylight saving time changes. This ambiguity results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` exception. The function creates labels and bins for the data but fails when dealing with these problematic timestamps.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the behavior when handling timestamps that are ambiguous due to daylight saving time. One common strategy is to localize timestamps at the beginning of the day to avoid the ambiguous adjustment that `date_range` might introduce.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()  # Localize to midnight
    last = ax[-1].normalize()  # Localize to midnight

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

## Conclusion
The corrected function now localizes the timestamps to midnight at the beginning of the day to avoid ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This adjustment ensures that the `AmbiguousTimeError` is resolved, and the function should now work properly for the provided test case and the GitHub issue.
