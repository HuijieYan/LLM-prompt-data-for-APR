### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when a call to `groupby` with a daily frequency encounters an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The error arises from the `_get_time_bins` method in the `resample.py` file.

The expected input consists of a `DatetimeIndex` object with specific timestamps and time zone information, along with other parameters needed for binning. The expected output includes correctly adjusted `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes on the clock change day. In this specific situation, adjustment for these timestamps is needed to avoid errors.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the improper handling of ambiguous times during a clock change day. The code does not account for the ambiguity in timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when creating the bins and labels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, the code should be modified to properly handle ambiguous timestamps by adjusting them accordingly. The timestamp range edges should be handled in a way that considers the daylight saving time shift, ensuring that the bins and labels are created correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq.to_offset()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        periods=len(ax) + 1,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts the `first` and `last` timestamps to handle the daylight saving time shift correctly. It also considers the period length for the date range generation and ensures proper adjustment of the labels.

This fix should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue during the clock change day in Cuba and provide the expected grouping results.
