## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function is supposed to generate time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex` based on specified frequency, start, and end points. The bug leads to incorrect bin generation, especially on clock change days where midnight time is ambiguous.

The key issues are:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function doesn't consider the possibility of the end time containing nanoseconds, leading to errors.
2. Incorrect adjustments and comparisons with the bins and labels lead to mismatched lengths and incorrect assignments.

To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in how the start and end times are calculated and how the bins and labels are organized and handled.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This fix addresses the issues by calculating `first` and `last` based on the floor and ceiling of the min and max times, ensuring accurate bins generation, and consistent adjustments for labels. This correction ensures that the function handles clock change days correctly and aligns with the expected behavior in the GitHub issue.
