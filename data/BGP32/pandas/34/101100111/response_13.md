## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not.
2. It calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, then creates `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` based on the calculated timestamps.
3. It performs further calculations and adjustments for bins, labels, and bins generation based on the input parameters and data.
4. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during clock change days.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the function tries to handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps is being used directly without considering the potential ambiguity that may arise due to daylight saving time changes. This leads to incorrect binning of data and ambiguities in time labels, which results in failing the provided test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use a more robust approach to handle the potential ambiguity in timestamps during clock change days.
2. Ensure that the binning and labeling of data take into account the specific time changes that occur.
3. Make necessary adjustments to the calculations and comparisons to correctly handle the data inside and outside the ambiguous time window.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert("UTC")  # Convert to UTC for unambiguous calculations
    first = ax_utc.min()
    last = ax_utc.max()

    if last.hour == 0 and last.minute == 0 and last.second == 0:
        last += timedelta(seconds=1)  # Avoid ambiguous time on last bin edge

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_convert(ax.tz),
        end=last.tz_convert(ax.tz),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Applying the above corrections to consider UTC timestamps for calculations and avoiding ambiguous time edges should resolve the bug and align with the test case's expected output.
