## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a subclass of `Grouper`. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` as input and performs various operations to create `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The primary error appears to be related to the handling of time adjustments across the transition period during the clock change day. The `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, but adjustments made on these timestamps are not accurately reflected in `binner` and `labels`.

## Error Location
The error likely occurs in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` after generating `first` and `last` timestamps. The incorrect handling of the transition period during the clock change day could lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError` as reported on GitHub.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect adjustment of timestamps `first` and `last` during the clock change day in Cuba when handling daylight saving time. This leads to discrepancies in the generated `binner` and `labels`, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamps `first` and `last` are correctly adjusted to account for the time transition during the clock change day. Proper adjustments during the ambiguous time period will help generate accurate `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` without causing errors.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of timestamps during the clock change day, generating accurate `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` without causing any errors.
