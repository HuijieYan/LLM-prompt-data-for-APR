## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` expects the input parameter `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`, and it performs various operations based on this assumption.
2. The bug seems to arise due to the handling of the timestamps around the daylight saving time changes.
3. The failing test case aims to downsample data using a daily frequency but encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` on Cuba's clock change day.
4. The expected output includes three groups for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November with appropriate labels, addressing the ambiguous time issue.
5. The error is related to how the function handles time bins and labels around ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving transitions.
6. The corrections should account for the specific case of ambiguous times around the clock change in Cuba.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function `_get_time_bins` is unable to handle the ambiguity in timestamps around the clock change day. The function fails to assign appropriate labels to the groups, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify and address the specific issue causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. Implement a mechanism to handle ambiguous timestamps around the clock change.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz.dst(ax[0]) == timedelta(hours=1):
        # Handling ambiguous timestamps around daylight saving transitions
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating the handling of ambiguous timestamps around daylight saving time changes, the corrected function should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` during downsampling. The corrected function is adjusted to better accommodate the specific case highlighted in the failing test.
