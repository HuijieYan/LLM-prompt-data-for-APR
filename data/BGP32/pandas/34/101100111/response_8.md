## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module. This function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` (which should be a `DatetimeIndex`) and certain parameters like `freq`, `closed`, and `base`. The function uses the internal function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` to determine the range of timestamps to create the bins between.

The failing test case, `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, creates a `DatetimeIndex` with hourly frequency in UTC time zone and then converts it to the time zone "America/Havana" (which is relevant to the GitHub issue). The data is grouped by a daily frequency `Grouper` object and aggregated using mean. The expected result involves handling the transition due to daylight saving time on November 4th in Havana, Cuba.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The function assumes that the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, but it does not handle the case where the data points in `ax` span a daylight saving time transition (like on November 4th in Havana).
2. The creation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` may not account for the correct timestamps due to the issue with handling transitions.

## Explanation of the bug's cause

The bug is likely due to the function not handling the ambiguity in timestamps caused by daylight saving time transitions, resulting in incorrect binning and labeling of data points. This leads to the failure of the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` since the function does not correctly handle the case when transitioning across ambiguous times.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug and handle the ambiguous timestamps, adjustments need to be made in the calculation of `binner` and `labels`. Ensuring that the transition between time zones is correctly accounted for when creating the time bins will help resolve the issue. Additionally, handling the ambiguity in timestamps during the binning process is crucial for accurate grouping.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust the labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` with proper consideration for daylight saving time transitions and making sure that the labels align with the generated bins, we can address the bug and ensure the correct grouping of data points across ambiguous times.
