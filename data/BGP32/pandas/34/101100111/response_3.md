## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises when dealing with a specific scenario where there is a clock change day (e.g., daylight saving time transition) leading to an ambiguous timestamp.

The `DatetimeIndex` provided as input consists of hourly timestamps from November 3, 2018, to November 5, 2018, in the timezone 'America/Havana'. The bug occurs when trying to resample the data by day ('1D' frequency) using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`. The expected output should be three groups corresponding to each day: November 3rd, November 4th, and November 5th.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to a failure in handling ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change on November 4th, 2018, in the `America/Havana` timezone. When the resampling is performed on this specific day, the function raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` instead of producing the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.

The issue arises because the timestamps at midnight on November 4th are ambiguous due to the clock change. The error comes from the incorrect handling of these ambiguous timestamps during resampling by day.

## Fix Strategy
To address this bug and handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly during resampling, modifications are needed in the `_get_time_bins` function. Specifically, adjustments should be made to ensure that the timestamps before and after the ambiguous period on November 4th are properly captured, and the resampling operates smoothly without raising errors.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly and avoid raising the `AmbiguousTimeError` during resampling on the clock change day in Cuba. The resampling should produce the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
