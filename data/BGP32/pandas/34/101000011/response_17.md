### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`, which is crucial for grouping operations in pandas. The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue relates to how ambiguous timestamps are handled during a clock change day in a specific time zone, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` without considering ambiguous timestamps.
2. Handling of ambiguous timestamps and adjusting labels if needed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the fact that the implementation does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. The code does not consider the potential occurrence of ambiguous times leading to a mismatch between the generated bins and labels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly by adjusting the labels accordingly.
2. Ensure that the generated bins and labels align correctly even in the presence of ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # consider and handle ambiguous times during clock change days
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels to match the number of bins if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I added handling for ambiguous times with the `ambiguous="infer"` option in the `date_range` function. Additionally, I adjusted the labels to align with the generated bins even if ambiguous times are present.

By making these modifications, the function should now properly handle situations like clock change days where ambiguous times might occur, thus resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
