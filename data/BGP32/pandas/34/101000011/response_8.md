### Analysis:
- The GitHub issue describes a problem with the use of `pd.Grouper` on a day with a clock change in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The `TimeGrouper` class in the buggy function `_get_time_bins` is involved in creating time bins, which could potentially cause issues related to handling ambiguous time.
- The issue suggests that the transition to/from daylight saving time might interfere with binning daily frequency data.
- The root cause of the problem seems to be related to handling the exact timestamps on clock change days.

### Bug Identification:
- The function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class creates time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`.
- The use of `date_range` to generate bins is problematic on days with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug could be due to the reliance on `date_range` to generate labels on clock change days, which might not handle ambiguous time transitions correctly.
- The `date_range` function might not accurately represent the complete range on days with daylight saving time changes, leading to misalignment of bins and labels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To address the issue, we should improve the handling of ambiguous time transitions when generating time bins and labels.
- One possible solution is to explicitly handle ambiguous times during bin creation.
- Use an approach that ensures accurate binning, even on days with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        bin_edges = self._get_bin_edges(ax)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        binner, labels = self._get_bins_and_labels(ax, bin_edges, bins)
        
        return binner, bins, labels
    
    def _get_bin_edges(self, ax):
        # Return the bin edges considering ambiguous time transitions
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        return pd.date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    
    def _get_bins_and_labels(self, ax, bin_edges, bins):
        labels = binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq, start=bin_edges[0], end=bin_edges[-1], tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner if self.label != "right" else binner[1:]
        else:
            labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels

        if ax.hasnans:
            add_nan = lambda x: x.insert(0, NaT)
            binner, labels = map(add_nan, [binner, labels])

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, labels
```

### Bug Fix Description:
- The corrected code introduces a new method `_get_bin_edges` to handle the calculation of accurate bin edges, considering ambiguous time transitions.
- The `_get_bins_and_labels` method refines the creation of bins and labels based on the derived bin edges.
- By addressing the ambiguity in time transitions explicitly during bin and label creation, the corrected code aims to resolve the issue of improper binning on days with clock changes.
