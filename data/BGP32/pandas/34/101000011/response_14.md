## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:

The function `_get_time_bins` within the class `TimeGrouper` is responsible for generating time bins based on a given `DatetimeIndex`. The function calls another function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` to determine the first and last timestamps, then uses `date_range` to create bins based on the frequency specified.

The GitHub issue indicates a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency in specific time zones.

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The issue could be related to how the first and last timestamps are determined.
2. There might be a problem with creating the bins using `date_range` without considering ambiguous timestamps.
3. The adjustment of labels and bins based on the closed side might introduce inconsistency.

## Cause of the bug:

The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the scenario of ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on clock change days. The use of `date_range` and adjustments of labels and bins do not account for this situation, leading to errors like `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To resolve the bug, we need to modify the way time bins are generated and labeled to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This may involve adjusting the creation of bins, labels, and bin edges to account for potential ambiguous time points.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = [NaT] + binner
        labels = [NaT] + labels

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to handle ambiguous timestamps by setting the `ambiguous` parameter in `date_range` to `"infer"`. Additionally, the insertion of `NaT` values into the `binner` and `labels` if `ax.hasnans` is addressed, ensuring consistency between bins and labels. These changes aim to resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported on clock change days in specific time zones.
