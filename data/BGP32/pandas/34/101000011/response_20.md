### Analysis:
The bug occurs when dealing with ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock-change days. The issue arises from how the `TimeGrouper` class handles the adjustment of bin edges and labels based on the datetime data passed to it. This leads to incorrect labeling and grouping of data, causing errors like `AmbiguousTimeError` as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the method `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly. Specifically, when creating the time bins and labels, the bin edges are not adjusted properly to handle ambiguous times, leading to mislabeling and grouping issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges and labels are adjusted correctly to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock-change days. This involves refining how the `binner` and `labels` are created based on the provided frequency, start, end, and timezone information.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels based on bins length
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for handling ambiguous timestamps to ensure correct binning and labeling, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
