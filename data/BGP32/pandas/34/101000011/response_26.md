### Analysis:
The bug occurs when handling daily frequency data that involves a clock change on certain days, causing ambiguity in timestamps. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping process.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of timestamps that include an ambiguous time period due to a clock change.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is not properly handling the time bins and labels for cases where there are ambiguous timestamps, such as during the clock change day in Cuba. This results in incorrect binning and labeling of the data, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle situations where timestamps are ambiguous, especially during clock change days. We need to ensure that the generation of bins and labels properly accounts for these ambiguous time periods.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for the issue related to clock change days
    # Use an additional parameter to consider ambiguous times
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base, ambiguous='infer'
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, an additional parameter `ambiguous='infer'` is passed to `_get_timestamp_range_edges` to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, ensuring correct binning and labeling on clock change days.
