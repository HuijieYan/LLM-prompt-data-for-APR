## Analysis
The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises when the `pd.Grouper` is used with a daily frequency, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue arises because the `date_range()` function is called to generate labels, which does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

## Identified Error
The error occurs in the `_get_time_bins()` function where the `date_range()` function is called. The function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days in the `_get_time_bins()` function. The `date_range()` function used to generate labels does not consider ambiguous timestamps, leading to the error.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly during clock change days. This can be achieved by modifying the way labels are generated to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins()` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `date_range()` function has been modified to handle ambiguous timestamps by setting `ambiguous="infer"`. This change ensures that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly during clock change days in Cuba.
