### Analysis:
The bug revolves around handling ambiguous timestamps when dealing with daily frequency data, particularly on days where a clock change occurs. The issue arises due to how `pd.Grouper` does not handle these cases effectively, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. More specifically, the issue arises when generating bins and labels for the data on days with clock changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function does not account for handling ambiguous timestamps during clock changes. This leads to incorrect binning and labeling of the data, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially on days with clock changes. The logic for generating bins and labels should be adjusted to ensure accurate grouping of the data without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0],
        end=ax[-1],
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to handle the ambiguous timestamps efficiently, ensuring that the data is binned and labeled correctly, thereby resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.
