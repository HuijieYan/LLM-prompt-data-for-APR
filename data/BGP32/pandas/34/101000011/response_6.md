### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py`. It is used to generate time bins for grouping datetime indexes. The GitHub issue indicates a problem related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes, where the use case involves creating daily frequency groups that span a clock change day in Cuba.

### Potential Errors:
1. The issue arises from the usage of the `date_range` function to create bins without considering ambiguous timestamps.
2. The function doesn't handle the transition between time zones on daylight saving time change days causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bugs Cause:
The bug occurs because `date_range` is being used to create bins but doesn't handle the transition between ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes, resulting in erroneous grouping.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to handle the transition between ambiguous timestamps properly. One approach is to use the `isin` function to check for ambiguous locations and adjust the labels accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # handle ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes
    ambiguous_locs = ax.indexer_between_time("00:00:00", "01:00:00")  # adjust based on timezone
    if len(ambiguous_locs) > 0:
        labels = labels.drop(ambiguous_locs)
        binner = binner.drop(ambiguous_locs)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the function now handles ambiguous timestamps by locating them using `indexer_between_time` and adjusting labels and bins accordingly. This modification ensures that groups are created correctly on clock change days in time zones affected by daylight saving time changes.
