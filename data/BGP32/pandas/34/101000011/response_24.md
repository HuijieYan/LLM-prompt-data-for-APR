## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper`, which is used in the context of resampling time series data in Pandas.
2. The issue described on GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba when using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.
3. The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous time stamps during clock change, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely due to not properly handling ambiguous timestamps during clock changes, especially in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue related to Cuba's clock change days.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the time bins are correctly adjusted on clock change days. Specifically, we need to handle cases where midnight local time might be ambiguous due to the clock change.
   
## Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Check for ambiguous timestamps and adjust labels accordingly
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._is_utcoffset_positive is not None:
        ambiguous_indices = ax.partial_tz_convert(ax.tz).index[ax.partial_tz_convert(ax.tz).isna()]
        labels = labels.drop(ambiguous_indices)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for ambiguous timestamps after adjusting time bins. We look for ambiguous indices in the input DatetimeIndex `ax` and remove these ambiguous timestamps from the labels if found. This adjustment ensures proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock change days like the one described in the GitHub issue related to Cuba.
