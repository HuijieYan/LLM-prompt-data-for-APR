### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub mentions a problem with `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba when using daily frequency. This error is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change when grouping data.

### Error Location:
The probable cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function in the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly when generating bins for grouping the time series data.

### Bug Explanation:
The function `date_range` is used to generate date ranges based on the frequency, start, and end dates. However, it may not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially during clock changes where a timestamp may be repeated due to a shift in time.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `date_range` function handles ambiguous timestamps and clock changes appropriately. It may involve addressing how the `date_range` function deals with duplicated timestamps caused by time shifts.

### Corrected Version of the Function `_get_time_bins`:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Add normalize argument to handle ambiguous timestamps
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, an additional argument `normalize=True` is added to the `date_range` function call. This `normalize` argument helps in handling ambiguous timestamps by normalizing the range of dates. By setting `normalize=True`, the function can appropriately handle the case of duplicated timestamps caused by time shifts, such as during a clock change day.

By adding this argument, the corrected version aims to address the issue reported on GitHub related to `AmbiguousTimeError` during clock changes in Cuba when using daily frequency for grouping time series data.
