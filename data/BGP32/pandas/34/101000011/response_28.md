### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` inside the class `TimeGrouper` is responsible for generating time bins based on the provided `DatetimeIndex`.
- The issue described on GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock-change days.
- The buggy function does not account for ambiguous timestamps and may lead to errors when generating time bins around these timestamps.

### Potential Error Location:
- The error might occur when creating time bins around ambiguous timestamps like midnight on clock-change days.
- The issue might arise in the part where the `DatetimeIndex` is converted to `date_range` using `start` and `end`.
- Handling of ambiguous time could pose a problem, especially in cases like clock-change days.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is likely caused by the conversion of `DatetimeIndex` to `date_range` without considering ambiguous timestamps.
- When dealing with time bins, the function doesn't handle the transition on clock-change days, leading to potential errors like the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in `_get_time_bins` to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on clock-change days.
- Consider using the provided GitHub issue details to guide the modifications needed to address the problem.
- The `date_range` function needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps within the provided frequency correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Consider handling ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.inferred_freq == "D":
        tzs = binner.tz
        binner = infer_day_start(binner, astz=tzs)
        labels = infer_day_start(labels, astz=tzs)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, additional logic is included to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The `infer_day_start` function is speculative and should be adjusted based on actual implementation details for handling ambiguous timestamps.
