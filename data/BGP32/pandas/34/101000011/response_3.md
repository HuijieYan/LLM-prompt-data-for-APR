### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for getting time bins based on the input `ax` (assuming it's a `DatetimeIndex`). 
2. The issue described on GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The bug in the function might be related to how it handles timestamps on a day with ambiguous time due to a clock change.
4. The GitHub issue illustrates a scenario where specifying the timezone results in an ambiguous time situation, causing `pd.Grouper` to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. The fix should involve handling ambiguous times correctly to prevent the error when grouping by time frequencies.

### Bug's Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, especially during a clock change day. This leads to incorrect grouping, as seen in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the implementation of `_get_time_bins` to address ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. Specifically, we should ensure that timestamps are handled correctly when creating bins and labels to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Correctly handle ambiguous times during a clock change
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins handling ambiguous times appropriately
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if they exceed the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly during a clock change day, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue as described in the GitHub problem statement. Now, the function should group time data accurately based on the specified frequency without encountering errors related to ambiguous timestamps.
