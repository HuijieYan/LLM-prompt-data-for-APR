## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. The function aims to generate time bins based on input datetime index `ax`.

The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with handling an ambiguous time on a clock-change day in Cuba. The issue arises due to the treatment of time transitions, specifically when the day has a "fallback" for daylight saving time. The failure occurs during the groupby operation, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Errors in the Buggy Function
1. The function does not handle ambiguous times due to clock changes effectively.
2. The logic for determining the time bins and labels is flawed.
3. Incorrect use of `date_range` with daylight saving time transitions.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of time transitions on a clock-change day causing an AmbiguousTimeError. The function fails to appropriately capture the edge cases when transitioning between different time zones during daylight saving changes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust how the time bins are calculated to handle daylight saving time transitions, particularly on clock-change days. Improved logic for labeling and binning during such transitions is necessary.

## Implementation: Corrected Function
After analyzing the bug and expected behavior, here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Make sure to replace the buggy function with this corrected version in the pandas library to address the AmbiguousTimeError identified in the GitHub issue. The corrected function implements improved logic for handling ambiguous times on clock-change days.
