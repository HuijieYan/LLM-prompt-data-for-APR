# Fixing the buggy function

### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is expected to return `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`. However, the bug causes an issue with the time zone conversion during the day when a clock change occurs (in this case, in Cuba). This results in ambiguous timestamps and an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Identifying potential error locations:
The bug likely occurs when determining the `binner` and `labels` for the time bins, where ambiguity arises due to the change in time zone. The use of `date_range` and `tz_localize` can lead to incorrect binning.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is triggered by the misalignment of time zones during the day of the clock change in Cuba. Incorrect timestamp labeling due to the shift forward or other ambiguities causes the grouping operation to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid potential ambiguities in timestamp labeling by properly handling the time zone conversion during the day of the clock change.
2. Ensure correct alignment of labels and bins to prevent errors related to the ambiguous time in the time zone.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Maintain original time zone for consistency
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle non-existent times
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure labels align with bins to prevent errors
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Applying the above corrections to the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change in Cuba and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`. You can test this corrected version with the provided failing test case to verify its functionality.
