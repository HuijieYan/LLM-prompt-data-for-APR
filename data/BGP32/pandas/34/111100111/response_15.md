The bug in the provided function `_get_time_bins` arises due to the improper handling of timestamps on clock change days. Specifically, on a day when the clock changes due to Daylight Saving Time, there can be ambiguous timestamps like midnight. The function fails to handle this situation correctly, leading to the mentioned GitHub issue "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba".

To fix this bug, it is crucial to ensure that the time range edges `first` and `last` are handled correctly, especially on days where there is an ambiguity like in the test case provided.

A possible strategy to fix the bug is to modify the calculation of `first` and `last` to ensure that the timestamps are adjusted properly for the specific case of midnight ambiguity. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
from numpy import nan

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
  
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
          raise TypeError(
              "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
              f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
          )
      
        if len(ax) == 0:
          binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
          return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
          ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
          freq=self.freq,
          start=first,
          end=last,
          tz=ax.tz,
          name=ax.name,
          ambiguous="infer",
          nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # Find edges where the clock changes to handle the ambiguity
        time_edges = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq='H', tz=ax.tz)
        bin_edges = [edge for edge in time_edges if edge.hour % 2 == 0]
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
          ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
          labels = binner
          if self.label == "right":
              labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
          labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
          binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
          labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
          labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures that the timestamps are adjusted considering the ambiguity on clock change days. The `bin_edges` are determined to handle the situation where the clock changes occur, ensuring that the groupby operation works as expected even on such days with ambiguous timestamps.
