## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is designed to create time bins based on the input `ax` (which should be a `DatetimeIndex`).
2. The function is supposed to calculate the time range first and then generate bins based on that range.
3. The issue likely arises from handling ambiguous timestamps, especially during the transition due to daylight saving time changes.
4. The provided GitHub issue indicates a specific problem with ambiguous timestamps in Cuba during the clock change.
5. The code fails to handle this situation gracefully, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError, making it necessary to update the function's logic to address this specific scenario.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the inefficient handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in the `_get_time_bins` function. The function doesn't account for this scenario properly, leading to the error reported in the GitHub issue. The transition from one time zone to another during certain days is not handled correctly, causing the function to fail on those specific days.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous timestamps during the clock change from one time zone to another. The function should be updated to ensure that it correctly handles the time range calculation and bin creation, specifically addressing the issue of ambiguous timestamps.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnan=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

In the corrected version, we added handling for ambiguous timestamps when creating the time bins to address the specific issue reported in the GitHub problem. The adjustments made aim to properly handle scenario of ambiguous times during the clock change, ensuring the function can generate bins correctly without raising any errors.
