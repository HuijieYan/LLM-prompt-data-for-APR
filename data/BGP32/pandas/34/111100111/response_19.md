## Analysis

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on a given `DatetimeIndex` and frequency. The bug seems to relate to handling datetime values during a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time becomes ambiguous.

The `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test case involves creating a `DataFrame` with hourly data from November 3rd to November 5th in the `America/Havana` time zone and then down-sampling it to daily intervals using a frequency of `1D`. The expected output is correct grouping of data considering the clock change day.

The issue posted on GitHub highlights that on clock change days in Cuba, the `pd.Grouper` operation raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to improper handling of midnight timestamps. The expected output mentioned in the issue aligns with the desired behavior of the function `_get_time_bins`.

## Bug Explanation

The bug is likely occurring when calculating the `first` and `last` timestamp values on a clock change day like November 4th in the `America/Havana` time zone. The discrepancy might arise from handling timestamps around midnight incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to handle the midnight timestamps on clock change days properly, ensuring that the time bins are generated correctly without causing ambiguity errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first if first is not None else ax.min(),
        end=last if last is not None else ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated version addresses the issue by handling the `first` and `last` timestamps appropriately to avoid ambiguity errors.

The corrected function should now work correctly for the provided test case and resolve the GitHub issue regarding the handling of clock change days in Cuba.
