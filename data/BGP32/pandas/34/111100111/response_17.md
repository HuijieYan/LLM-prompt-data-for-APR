### Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for grouping based on the given `ax` axis, but it encounters an issue related to ambiguous time particularly during a clock change day.
- The issue arises when creating the `binner` and `labels` based on the `freq`, `start`, and `end` values, leading to incorrect binning results due to the ambiguous times.
- The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` highlights the problem by showing that the expected output is incorrect due to the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function.
- The issue on GitHub provides a detailed explanation of the problem and the expected behavior, emphasizing the occurrence of `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock-change days.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the use of `date_range` to create `binner` and `labels` without considering the ambiguity caused by daylight saving time transitions.
- During the processing of data from the test case on a clock-change day in Cuba, the function fails to handle the timestamps correctly due to not accounting for the ambiguous midnight time when creating the time bins.
- This leads to incorrect grouping and subsequently raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`, indicating the inconsistency in handling the time data accurately during the transition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` to handle ambiguous times during clock changes properly. This adjustment should ensure that the time bins are generated correctly without causing `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. Update the function logic to account for ambiguous timestamps and adjust the binning process accordingly based on the provided `freq`, `start`, and `end` values.
3. Incorporate the necessary adjustments to align the binning results with the expected behavior described in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins`
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use offset-naive times to avoid ambiguity issues
    first = first.tz_localize(None)
    last = last.tz_localize(None)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using offset-naive times for `first` and `last`, the corrected function can handle ambiguous times properly and generate the time bins as expected. This adjustment helps in resolving the issue related to ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.
