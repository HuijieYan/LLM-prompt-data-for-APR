## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is generating incorrect bin labels when dealing with time intervals that involve changes due to daylight saving time. This issue is related to the buggy behavior reported on GitHub, where the code fails in handling ambiguous time stamps on clock change days.

The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` `ax`, calculates the time ranges based on the frequency, and generates bin labels, adjusting for potential issues with daylight saving time. The problematic behavior arises when the function generates bins and labels for time intervals spanning the ambiguous timestamp on a clock change day.

## Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the daylight saving time transition on clock change days, resulting in inaccurate bin labels that may lead to errors when grouping data using the erroneous labels.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to address how the function generates bin labels when dealing with time intervals affected by daylight saving time changes. By ensuring that the function correctly handles the time ranges and labels, considering the potential ambiguity caused by daylight saving time, we can provide accurate bin boundaries and prevent errors in the grouping operation.

## Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function accounts for the daylight saving time transitions when generating bin labels, ensuring that the labels accurately reflect the intervals without errors caused by ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This fix should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and provide correct bin labels for grouping time intervals.
