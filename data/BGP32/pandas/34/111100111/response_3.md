After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can see that the issue arises when handling the transition on a clock change day in a specific timezone (e.g., Cuba), resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue description from GitHub provides valuable insight into the problem.

The bug originates from the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps being directly used without considering possible ambiguous time scenarios due to clock changes. The erroneous handling of timestamps results in incorrect binning and labeling. To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the way the bin edges are determined and labeled, especially on days with ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_time_bins` function as follows:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        # Adjust bin edges for possible ambiguous times
        bin_edges = np.append(np.array(binner), binner[-1] + pd.Timedelta(1, 'ns'))
        binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version of the function, we now adjust the `bin_edges` to include the end of the range with a slight offset to account for any potential ambiguous time issues. By applying this modification, we address the problem described in the GitHub issue and ensure correct binning and labeling, especially on clock change days in timezones like the one mentioned (e.g., Cuba).

This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and align the function with the expected behavior outlined in the provided test case.
