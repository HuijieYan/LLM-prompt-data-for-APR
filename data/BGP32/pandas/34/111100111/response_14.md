## Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class of the `pandas` library fails to properly handle the case of daylight saving time transitions resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue reported on GitHub (#25758) illustrates a situation where a call to groupby with a daily frequency on a date that experiences a daylight saving time transition in Cuba leads to this error.

The `TimeGrouper` class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, and the `_get_time_bins` method is responsible for determining the time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex` `ax`.

The expected behavior is to correctly process the time bins, labels, and other related variables in the presence of ambiguous times due to daylight saving time transitions.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. Handling of daylight saving time transitions in determining the `first` and `last` time bin range.
2. Incorrect handling of labels and bin edges when timezone information is involved.
3. Inadequate adjustment of labels based on the specified closed and label options.

## Cause of the bug

The bug arises from improper handling of the daylight saving time transitions when determining the time range (`first` and `last`) and adjusting the labels and bins in the presence of ambiguous times. The incorrect labeling leads to the AmbiguousTimeError in cases like the one described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Ensure proper handling of the daylight saving time transitions in the calculation of time range.
2. Adjust labels and bins appropriately considering timezone information.
3. Account for ambiguous times during transitions in the labeling process.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first = ax.min().normalize()
        last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
            name=ax.name
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        # Adjust the labels based on closed and label options
        labels = bins[:-1] if self.closed == 'right' else bins

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures proper handling of daylight saving time transitions in determining the time range, adjusts labels and bins based on the closed and label options, and accounts for ambiguous times appropriately.

This correction should address the AmbiguousTimeError and provide the expected behavior for the described scenario in the GitHub issue.
