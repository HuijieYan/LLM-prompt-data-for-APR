### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is part of the `pandas` library's resample functionality, which is used for time-interval grouping. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input time index (`ax`) and the frequency specified.

### Bugs in the Function:
1. The issue described in the GitHub problem occurs due to the presence of ambiguous time on a clock change day, specifically in the case of Cuba.
2. The function currently does not handle the ambiguous time situation correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

### Bug Cause:
The `_get_time_bins` function does not correctly handle the ambiguous time situation that arises on the clock change day in Cuba. This leads to an error when trying to group the data using the `pd.Grouper`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the time bins are generated in `_get_time_bins`. Specifically, additional handling for the ambiguous time on clock change days should be implemented. This can be achieved by adjusting the bin edges and labels to account for the ambiguous midnight timestamp.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if first == pd.Timestamp(min(binner)):
        labels = labels[1:]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

### How the Fix Addresses the Bug:
The corrected version of the function now includes an additional check to handle the ambiguous time situation on clock change days. By adjusting the labels based on the comparison between the calculated first timestamp and the minimum value in the time bins, we ensure that the ambiguous time at the start of the day is handled correctly.

By implementing this fix, the function should now be able to group the data properly without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba.
