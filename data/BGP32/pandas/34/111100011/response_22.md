## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to calculate the time bins based on the provided frequency and axis values.
2. The issue arises when handling 'AmbiguousTimeError' on clock-cange days, specifically in Cuba, where midnight local time becomes an ambiguous timestamp. This leads to an error in grouping the data correctly.
3. The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates this issue by creating a DataFrame with hourly data that includes the ambiguous time on a clock-change day in Cuba and then trying to group the data by day using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`.
4. The GitHub issue titled 'groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba' provides additional details and expected output related to this bug.

## Bug Fixes:
1. The bug can be fixed by handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly during the time bin calculations in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. To address this issue, we need to adjust the bin edges calculation logic to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.
3. By ensuring that the bin edges generation considers these ambiguous times and adjusts the bin labels accordingly, we can resolve the bug.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._ambiguous_dates:
            # adjust bin labels based on ambiguous times
            labels = labels.where(~ax.tz._ambiguous_dates, other=labels[0])
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating the adjustment for ambiguous timestamps based on the timezone information, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to correctly handle the clock-change day issue in Cuba and pass the failing test case.
