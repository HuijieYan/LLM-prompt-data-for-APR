## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper` which is a subclass of `Grouper`.
2. The function receives a DatetimeIndex `ax` and performs various operations on it to generate time bins.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timezones during the transition of time on clock change days as described in the GitHub issue. The issue is due to time adjustment and handling in the function which leads to incorrect binning of timestamps.
4. The bug is likely causing the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, where the result is different from the expected output due to the incorrect handling of timestamps on clock change days.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the time binning logic to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on clock change days.

## Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    datetimes = ax.to_pydatetime()
    first = datetimes[0]
    last = datetimes[-1]
    
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last + self.freq, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting how the first and last timestamps are calculated and handling the timezone transition properly in the `date_range` call, we ensure that ambiguous timestamps on clock change days are correctly handled to generate the expected output.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` pass successfully.
