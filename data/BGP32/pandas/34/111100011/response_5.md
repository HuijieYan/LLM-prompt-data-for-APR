### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a subclass of `Grouper`.
2. The function checks whether the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not.
3. If the length of the `ax` is 0, it creates an empty `binner` and returns that along with empty lists for `labels`.
4. The main issue seems to be related to how the `date_range` is generated for `binner` and `labels`. This is causing problems with handling the time binning properly, especially on days like the clock change day in Cuba.
5. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tests the aggregation with a specific frequency, and the expectation is not being met due to the bug.
6. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba, pointing to the same underlying issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially when generating `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. This causes issues with time binning, leading to errors like the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` generation for `binner` and `labels` properly deals with ambiguous timestamps and handles them correctly, especially on days like the clock change day in Cuba. This may involve adjusting the generation of these date ranges to handle ambiguous times better.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Shift non-existing times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the adjustments in the generation of `binner` and `labels` during time binning, addressing issues with ambiguous timestamps, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the mentioned GitHub issue.
