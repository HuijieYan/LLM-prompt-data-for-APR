### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function expects the input `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex` and then performs various operations based on that assumption.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps caused by the daylight saving time shifts, as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The code fails to handle cases where a timestamp is ambiguous due to daylight saving time changes.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time shifts. The code fails to adjust for these ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code handles ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating the binner and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. This involves addressing the issue related to daylight saving time shifts and ensuring that the labels for groups are assigned appropriately.

### Correction:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        # Adjust for daylight saving time shifts
        start_ts = ax.min().to_pydatetime()
        end_ts = ax.max().to_pydatetime()
        
        if start_ts != first:
            first += pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # Adjust for ambiguous timestamp
        
        if end_ts != last:
            last += pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # Adjust for ambiguous timestamp
    
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # Generate bins
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # Adjust labels if necessary
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function now correctly adjusts for the ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time shifts, ensuring that the labels for groups are assigned appropriately based on the adjusted timestamps. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
