### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The bug appears to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a datetime index with a frequency of 1 hour, localizes it to UTC, then converts to the "America/Havana" timezone where an ambiguous time issue can arise due to daylight saving time changes in Cuba.
4. The bug triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to incorrect handling of time bins on the day of the daylight saving transition.
5. The issue on GitHub describes a similar problem where `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps as expected on a clock-changing day in Cuba.
6. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins are created correctly, considering the ambiguous times during the daylight saving transition.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times on daylight saving transitions correctly. Use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to specify how ambiguous times should be handled.
2. Adjust the label generation to avoid ambiguities that occur at the transition point.
3. Ensure that the labels and bins are in sync and avoid inserting NaT values in ambiguous situations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # If we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the corrected `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during daylight saving time transitions, resolving the issue described on GitHub.
