### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function is responsible for calculating time bins based on the provided `DatetimeIndex`, frequency, and other parameters.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous time values, specifically on clock change days, as described in the GitHub issue.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to this bug and aims to verify the correct behavior of downsampling with daily frequency, especially on days with ambiguous time values.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous time values on clock change days, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. The code does not properly adjust the `binner` and `labels` for the first and last bins when dealing with ambiguous timestamps, leading to an incorrect assignment of labels and bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous time values on clock change days by adjusting the `binner` and `labels` accordingly.
2. Ensure that the first and last bins are determined correctly, accounting for possible ambiguity in timestamps.
3. Modify the code to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner.copy()
            labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
        else:
            labels = binner.copy()
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By making these adjustments to properly handle ambiguous time values and aligning with the expected behavior, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
