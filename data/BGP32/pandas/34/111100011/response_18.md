## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins based on a given DatetimeIndex. 
2. The bug likely causes an issue in handling ambiguous time during a clock-change day in Cuba.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` provides a scenario where datetime indexing is applied, and the groupby operation might lead to ambiguous timestamps.
4. The GitHub issue points out the exact problem where on clock-change days, midnight local time being ambiguous leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue specifies the expected behavior in such cases.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins are correctly generated, handling ambiguous time situations and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Handle ambiguous time situations, especially around midnight during clock changes.
2. Adjust the bin edges and labels appropriately to avoid `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. Ensure correct labeling and grouping for the given datetime data.
4. Align the behavior of the grouping operation with the expected output mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    if self.closed == 'left':
        last = last + 1  # Adjust the last time bin to include data at the end

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner if self.closed == 'left' else binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly generate time bins and labels, addressing the ambiguity of timestamps on clock-change days, and aligning with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
