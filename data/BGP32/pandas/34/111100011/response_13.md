## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that during a clock change day in Cuba, the timestamp at midnight may be ambiguous and leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly, potentially leading to errors while processing data on clock change days.
4. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of time bins and labels, especially around the transition time during a clock change day.
5. To fix this, we need to adjust how the time bins are generated and labeled to account for the ambiguity in timestamp values during a clock change.



## Bug Fix:
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        start_freq = first if self.base == 0 else last
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=start_freq,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # Adjust bins for right-closed frequency
        if self.closed == "right" and self.freq is not None:
            bin_end = Timestamp(start).ceil(self.freq)
            labels = binner[binner <= bin_end]
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        return binner, labels, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses the issue related to handling time bins on clock change days. It accounts for the ambiguity in timestamps by adjusting the frequency and labels appropriately. This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
