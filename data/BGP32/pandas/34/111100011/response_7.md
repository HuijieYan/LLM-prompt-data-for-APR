## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The issue reported on GitHub (#25758) describes a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba, where `pd.Grouper` raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` also demonstrates the problem during the clock change day.
4. The issue seems related to handling timezone conversions and ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

## Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect handling of timestamps during daylight saving time.
2. Inadequate handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The `_get_time_bins` function is not properly adjusting the bin edges for these ambiguous timestamps, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping operation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day.
2. Adjust the bin edges to account for the daylight saving time transition.
3. Use appropriate methods for handling timezone conversions and ambiguous timestamps.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta(days=1),  # Adjust for the clock change day
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the issue reported on GitHub (#25758) should be resolved, and the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully. The adjustment for the clock change day should properly handle the ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time transition.
