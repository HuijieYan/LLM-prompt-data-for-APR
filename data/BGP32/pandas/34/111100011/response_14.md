### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file is used for generating time bins for grouping datetime data.
- The bug causes an issue related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, as described in the GitHub issue.
- The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the use of `date_range` to generate labels for time bins, which does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- When using ambiguous timestamps (e.g., on a clock change day in Cuba), the time bins are not labeled correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the generation of time bins and labels.
- One potential solution is to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly during the creation of time bins to ensure correct labeling.
- Ensure that the time bins cover the entire range correctly without ambiguity on clock change days.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Get time labels for bins
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bin_edges) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bin_edges)]

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

By adjusting the generation of time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function, we can ensure that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
