## Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file of pandas.
2. The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis (`ax`) which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the issue by trying to group data for each day but encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling ambiguous midnight timestamps.
5. The GitHub issue #25758 describes a similar problem where the `pd.Grouper` fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The issue is likely related to how the `date_range` function is used to generate bin edges. It may not account for the ambiguity of timestamps during daylight saving time changes.
2. Handling of the midnight timestamps on the day when the clock changes in Cuba may be causing the error.

## Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs due to the `_get_time_bins` function not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially during daylight saving time transitions like the one in Cuba. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping data using `pd.Grouper`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during daylight saving time transitions.
2. Use appropriate methods to generate bin edges that account for possible ambiguities in timestamps.
3. Ensure that the labels and bins are adjusted properly based on the timezone and daylight saving time information.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If labels are more than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamp situations during daylight saving time transitions, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
