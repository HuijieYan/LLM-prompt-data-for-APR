## Analyzing the buggy function and related information:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex` and raises an error if not.
3. It then calculates the bin edges based on the minimum and maximum values of the input `ax` and a specified frequency. It uses `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to get the range edges.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the bin edges are calculated and labeled, potentially due to handling of nanoseconds in timestamps.
5. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to a scenario where there is an ambiguous timestamp (midnight) during a clock change day in Cuba, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be caused by the handling of nanoseconds in timestamps during the calculation of bin edges in the `_get_time_bins` function. This issue becomes prominent when dealing with ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of bin edges properly handles nanoseconds in timestamps to avoid errors related to ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. Adjusting the calculation logic to consider such scenarios and handle them appropriately should resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensuring proper handling of nanoseconds in timestamps, this corrected version of the function should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue in the failing test case and prevent similar errors in other scenarios as well.
