### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, raises a `TypeError` if it's not.
3. The function then calculates `first` and `last` timestamps using another function `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post indicates a problem on clock-change days where the midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.
4. The function then generates `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` based on the provided inputs and settings.
5. The final result is returned as `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the handling of timestamp range calculation, specifically around the change in clock time which leads to ambiguous times during clock changes. This causes incorrect binning and labeling of the data for that specific day.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To handle the ambiguous timestamps during clock changes, we need to adjust the logic for calculating `first` and `last` timestamps, ensuring that the transition across the clock change day is handled accurately.
2. More robust handling of timestamps and bin edges is required to prevent the issue described in the GitHub post.
3. Improvements might involve better handling of daylight saving time transitions or ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Use date range with frequency to cater to ambiguous timestamps during a clock change
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, improved handling of bin generation
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the handling of timestamps and bin edges, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now properly handle ambiguous timestamps during clock changes and pass the failing test case described in the GitHub issue.
