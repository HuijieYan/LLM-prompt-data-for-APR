## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` expects an input of type `DatetimeIndex` and calculates bin edges appropriately using the `date_range` function. However, the issue arises when there are ambiguous time points due to the time zone changes during daylight saving transitions. This results in wrong bin edges and subsequent errors.

The method `_get_timestamp_range_edges` calculates the initial bin boundaries but does not handle ambiguous time points effectively, resulting in incorrect bin edges and causing the error described in the GitHub issue.

To address this issue, we need the function to handle ambiguous time points correctly by considering the behavior of time zones during daylight saving transitions.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the calculation of `first` and `last` bin edges to handle ambiguous time points accurately.
2. Ensure that the bin edges are correctly determined based on the offset frequency and the time zone.
3. Handle the time zone transition correctly for the bin edges.
4. Update labels and bins according to the corrected bin edges.
5. Test the function against the expected values and types in the failing test case.

## Bug Fix
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = self._get_first_bin_edge(ax.min())
    last = self._get_last_bin_edge(ax.max())
    
    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

def _get_first_bin_edge(self, min_value):
    return min_value.floor(self.freq)

def _get_last_bin_edge(self, max_value):
    return max_value.ceil(self.freq)
```

The corrected function now accurately calculates the first and last bin edges based on the frequency offset and adjusts for ambiguous time points due to time zone transitions. The `self._get_first_bin_edge` and `_get_last_bin_edge` methods are introduced to handle rounding the bin edges correctly.

By addressing these issues, the function should now correctly generate the bins and labels as expected, resolving the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.
