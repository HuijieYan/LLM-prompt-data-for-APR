### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class checks the input `ax` to be of type `DatetimeIndex`, then calculates `first` and `last` timestamps using the helper function `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, and finally generates `binner`, `labels`, `ax_values`, and `bin_edges`. There is an issue related to nanosecond precision on clock change days as described in the GitHub issue.
   
2. The issue arises from the fact that handling nanoseconds on clock change days needs special consideration, especially with the operation of `date_range`. The `replace` call in `_get_timestamp_range_edges` was causing the nanoseconds to be omitted, which led to the problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurred due to clock change days in time bins calculation, where nanosecond precision was crucial. The usage of `replace` on `first` and `last` timestamps in `_get_timestamp_range_edges` caused the nanoseconds to be dropped, leading to incorrect bin calculations and a returned error on ambiguous timestamp days.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the issue, the nanosecond precision must be retained in timestamp calculations. Instead of using `replace` on timestamps, the initial timestamps should be used directly. This ensures that the nanoseconds are preserved during calculations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version avoids the use of `replace` and ensures that nanosecond precision is maintained during timestamp calculations, fixing the bug related to clock change days.
