### Analyzing the Buggy Function
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is responsible for grouping time-intervals.
2. It takes a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as a parameter along with other attributes of the class.
3. The function calls `_get_timestamp_range_edges` to calculate `first` and `last` values based on the input `ax`.
4. It then constructs `binner`, `labels` using `date_range`, and performs some operations based on the frequency and settings.
5. The bug is related to handling ambiguous time situations during time zone changes which leads to incorrect binning.

### Identified Errors
1. The code fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, specifically on clock change days.
2. Ambiguous timestamps are not handled properly which results in `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.
3. The bug is directly related to the issue posted in GitHub regarding groupby failing on clock change day in Cuba.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the time zone change in the `date_range` function, leading to `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.

### Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps properly while creating the `binner` and `labels` based on the input `DatetimeIndex`. This involves ensuring that the timestamps are processed correctly, especially during time zone changes.

### Corrected Code

```python
from pandas.errors import AmbiguousTimeError

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly handles ambiguous timestamps during time zone changes, addressing the root cause of the `AmbiguousTimeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
