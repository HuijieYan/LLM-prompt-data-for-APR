### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class and expects a `DatetimeIndex` as input. It calculates the bin edges and labels based on the datetime values in the input `ax`.
   
2. The bug arises when dealing with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This issue occurs due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time changes.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamp values. When `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function is called, it may lead to incorrect results on days where timestamp values are ambiguous due to daylight savings time changes. This results in incorrect `bin_edges` generation, causing errors further down the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, we need to adjust how the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This can be achieved by directly using the `start` and `end` timestamps without altering them. This way, the nanosecond part in the timestamps is preserved which is crucial for correctness.

### Bug-fixed code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        periods=len(ax),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report by correctly handling the ambiguous timestamps on time change days.
