Based on the information provided, the bug occurs because the timestamp range edges are being computed using `replace()` which causes the nanosecond part to be lost, leading to issues with precise time calculations, especially during time transitions like clock changes. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the calculation of `first` and `last` edges in the `_get_time_bins` function to directly use `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` without calling `replace()`. This will ensure that the nanosecond part is preserved for accurate time calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` directly, we ensure that the nanosecond part is retained, avoiding the inaccurate calculations caused by the loss of precision during time transitions.

This corrected version should address the issues reported in the GitHub bug related to ambiguous timestamps during time transitions.
