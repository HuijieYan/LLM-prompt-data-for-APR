## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. It's responsible for creating time bins based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The function uses the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to calculate the first and last timestamps, then creates the time bins and labels based on those timestamps.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, which results in incorrect bin calculation.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem occurs on a long clock-change day in Cuba, making midnight an ambiguous timestamp leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Bug Description:
The bug originates from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. The `ax` time index should correctly bin the data, allowing for the ambiguous midnight timestamp on the day of the clock change. Currently, the handling of this ambiguous timestamp results in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the time bins and labels are calculated to correctly handle the ambiguous midnight timestamp on the clock change day in question. This can be achieved by ensuring that the bin process considers the ambiguous midnight timestamp and labels it appropriately without causing errors due to ambiguity.

## Corrected Function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
        if self.closed == 'left':
          last = last - self.freq  # Adjust last time to account for the closed interval on the left

        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function will appropriately handle the ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, ensuring that the binning process proceeds smoothly without raising errors related to ambiguity.
