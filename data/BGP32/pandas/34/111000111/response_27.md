### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. This function aims to create time bins and labels based on the input `DatetimeIndex` and frequency specified. The problem described in the GitHub issue indicates an error related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in Cuba.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
2. Handling the conversion between time zones and handling ambiguities.
3. Generation of bin edges and bins.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises because the original implementation does not handle ambiguous times caused by daylight savings time changes properly on clock change days. This leads to the erroneous generation of bins and labels. The lack of adequate handling of these ambiguous times causes unexpected errors like the `AmbiguousTimeError` described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the code properly handles ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This would involve revisiting the logic related to time zone conversions, proper calculation of bin boundaries, and ensuring correct labeling of time bins.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz, # Preserve time zone information
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer", # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward", # Handle non-existent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the key issues related to handling ambiguous times by ensuring proper time zone conversion, proper use of `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters, and correct adjustment of bin labels based on bins' count. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue described in the GitHub report.
