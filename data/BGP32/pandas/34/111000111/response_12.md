### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is responsible for generating time bins based on the provided DatetimeIndex.
2. The bug arises due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day, specifically in the context of Cuba's timezone.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the failure of the `groupby` operation when daily frequency is used on a day with an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change.
4. The function fails to properly adjust the bin edges to handle such ambiguous timestamps.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps by considering the possible time label for the bins.
2. Avoid nanosecond part loss while setting bin edges.
3. Adjust labels when the labels exceed the bin length.
4. Insert NaT values for binner and labels if ax contains NaN values.
5. Return the corrected values for binner, bins, and labels.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjusting labels when needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    # Insert NaT if ax contains NaN values
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating the adjustments mentioned in the bug fix strategy, this corrected version of the function should now appropriately handle the ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day, particularly in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue related to Cuba's timezone.
