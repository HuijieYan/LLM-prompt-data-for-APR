### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to daylight saving time transitions which arise from handling ambiguous timestamp conversions.
3. The GitHub issue description highlights a similar problem where on clock-change days in certain timezones such as Cuba, midnight local time becomes an ambiguous timestamp leading to erroneous grouping.
4. The bug stems from improper handling of ambiguous timestamps arising from daylight saving time changes during calculations, affecting the grouping process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the usage of `date_range` to create bins without proper consideration for ambiguous timestamps caused by transitions such as daylight saving time changes. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the time grouping process is attempted.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the logic of creating the `binner` and `labels` inside the `_get_time_bins` method to properly handle ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time transitions. A potential solution is to identify ambiguous timestamps and handle them appropriately to avoid errors during binning.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time transition if present
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._dst at first >= 0 and (last.tz or first.tz) != (last - pd.Timedelta('1 day')).tz:
        # Offset the `first` timestamp for ambiguous midnight transition
        first -= pd.Timedelta('1 hour')

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version introduces logic to handle potential ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time transitions during time binning operations. By adjusting the `first` timestamp accordingly, the erroneous `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved.
