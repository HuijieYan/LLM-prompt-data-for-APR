### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating the time bins for resampling in Pandas. The error message suggests that the issue occurs due to an ambiguous time error when handling time zone (tz) conversions, specifically on a clock change day in Cuba.

The GitHub issue points out that the problem arises when attempting to group data by day (`freq='1D'`) on a day where daylight saving time (DST) is in effect. A specific example on November 4th, 2018, is mentioned, where the error occurs at the midnight timestamp due to the ambiguity.

### Potential Error Locations

1. Incorrect tz handling during the conversion process.
2. Time zone-related issues with midnight timestamps.
3. Incorrect comparison or generation of time bins.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the way Pandas handles the transition between standard time and DST on the ambiguous day in Cuba. The error message specifically highlights that an `AmbiguousTimeError` occurs when trying to infer the correct DST time because the times are not repeated.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of the ambiguous time on the clock change day, especially at midnight, is properly addressed. This may involve adjusting the tz localization/conversion process and how the time bins are generated to account for the DST changes correctly.

### Corrected Version in Python

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue with the ambiguous time error during time zone conversions:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax.min().normalize()
    end = ax.max().normalize()
    first = start.tz_localize(None)
    last = end.tz_localize(None)

    binner = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=None,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This version addresses the DST transition issue by localizing the start and end timestamps to `None` time zone before creating the bins. Additionally, it clarifies the handling of labels and bins to ensure they match correctly even on ambiguous timestamp days like the one in Cuba.
