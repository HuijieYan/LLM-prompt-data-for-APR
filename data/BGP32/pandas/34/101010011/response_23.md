### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba.
2. The issue on GitHub highlights that the `groupby` operation with daily frequency fails to handle this ambiguous timestamp scenario properly.
3. The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class, leading to the creation of date ranges containing ambiguous time.
4. The error is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. To fix the bug, appropriate handling of the ambiguous timestamp situation during the clock change day is necessary.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. In the `_get_time_bins` function, when creating date ranges, ensure that ambiguous times are handled correctly during the clock change day.
2. Implement logic to address the ambiguity using timezone information, avoiding the occurrence of the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handling ambiguous times during clock change day
    start = first.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    end = last.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        tz=ax.tz,  # Preserve timezone information
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By addressing the handling of ambiguous times during the clock change day, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function ensures that the `AmbiguousTimeError` is avoided during the `groupby` operation with daily frequency.
