### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the time axis has daylight saving time transitions, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to duplicate times. The error arises from the conversion to UTC, which fails to accommodate repeated times during the transition.

### Bug Location
The bug is in the `date_range` function call where the conversion is made to UTC without handling ambiguous times correctly during the daylight saving time transition.

### Bug Explanation
- During the daylight saving time transition on November 4th, 2018, the time goes from 2:00 AM to 1:00 AM. This results in a repeated time of '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00', which causes the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The bug arises from not handling ambiguous times during the `date_range` conversion to UTC correctly, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, adjust the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times during the daylight saving time transition. This can be achieved by setting the `ambiguous` parameter in `date_range` to 'NaT', which will avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function explicitly handles ambiguous times during the daylight saving time transition by setting `ambiguous="NaT"` in the `date_range` call. This change should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered during the test execution.
