The bug in the provided function `_get_time_bins` is related to the creation of time labels that involve daylight saving time transitions, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to overlapping hour periods.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range()` might not handle daylight saving transitions properly.
2. The adjustment of `binner` and `bin_edges` might not work correctly in the presence of ambiguous time periods.
3. The insertion of `NaT` values in `binner` and `labels` might disrupt the alignment with the data.

### Bug Explanation:
The error message `AmbiguousTimeError` indicates that the code is unable to handle ambiguous time periods correctly, specifically around the transition from standard to daylight saving time in the example provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the time range generation to handle daylight saving transitions.
2. Ensure that the binning process aligns properly with the data.
3. Avoid inserting `NaT` values that might lead to mismatched lengths.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()  # Get the date part only to avoid issues with transitions
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq  # End with the last date plus the frequency to include it

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,  
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    _, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on the adjusted edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        bins += 1  # Adjust right labeling to account for starting at 1

    return binner, bins, binner
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that time range creation handles overlapping hour periods correctly, adjust binning based on the data content, and return aligned time labels for correct grouping.
