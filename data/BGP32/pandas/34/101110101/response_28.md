### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins and labels for resampling. The error occurs when the function tries to construct date ranges that include daylight saving time transitions, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The specific issue arises when creating the labels within the function, especially handling the transition over the ambiguous time slot due to daylight saving time changes.


### Bug Identification
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of timestamps before and after the transition in the `date_range` function. Since `labels` are constructed based on `binner` calculated from `date_range`, this causes misalignment and eventually leads to an incorrect aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is necessary to precisely define the boundaries of the time bins and labels, ensuring they correctly represent the data while considering any daylight saving time transitions. A possible strategy is to adjust how the labels are constructed to avoid ambiguous time slots and ensure alignment with the corresponding bins.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label != "right":
        labels = binner[1:]  # Skip the first bin as label
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This bug-fixed version ensures proper alignment between time bins and labels, avoiding ambiguous time slots and addressing the issue causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during daylight saving time transitions.
