### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the function `_get_time_bins` is called with a `DatetimeIndex` that includes a transition for daylight saving time (DST) where the time skips due to the clock being set back. This causes an issue when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the `date_range` function does not handle the transition for daylight saving time (DST) elegantly. When the clock is set back during a DST transition, there are repeated times, causing ambiguity. This ambiguity is not handled correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `binner` and `labels` are created to handle the DST transition ambiguity. One way to address this is by checking for the presence of repeated times due to the DST transition and appropriately handling them.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first, end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Handle repeated times during DST transition
    mask = binner.duplicated(keep="first")
    binner = binner[~mask]
    labels = labels[~mask]

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By checking for duplicated times with `binner.duplicated(keep="first")` and removing them from `binner` and `labels`, we can resolve the issue with DST transitions causing repeated times. This fix should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure the correct behavior when handling the time bins.
