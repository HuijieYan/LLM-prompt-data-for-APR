### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in `pandas/core/resample.py` is designed to handle time bins for resampling. The error occurs when the given timestamps include an ambiguous time due to daylight saving time transitions, causing the function to fail.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an ambiguous timestamp during a daylight saving time transition in Cuba.
3. The function fails to handle the ambiguous time correctly, leading to the error. The expected output includes three groups for each day, with the label for Nov 4th set to the first midnight before the clock change.
4. To fix the bug, the function must handle ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions correctly, ensuring that the labeling and binning of timestamps work as expected.
5. By adjusting the logic related to handling ambiguous times and correctly setting bins and labels, we can address the issue observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Approach:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to address daylight saving transitions by handling ambiguous times appropriately.
2. Ensure that the bins and labels are set correctly to reflect the expected groups for each day, especially during the transition period.
3. Adjust the code to accurately label the group for the ambiguous timestamp on the transition day.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust handling of ambiguous times on daylight saving transitions
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the `_get_time_bins` function as shown above, the corrected logic should address the issue related to ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, ensuring the expected behavior for resampling operations in such scenarios.
