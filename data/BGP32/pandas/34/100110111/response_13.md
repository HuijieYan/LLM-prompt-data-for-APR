### Analysis
The bug is related to handling time zones and ambiguous time during a clock change day. The bug seems to occur when converting time zones and performing resampling with daily frequency. The failing test describes an issue with an AmbiguousTimeError during a clock change day in Cuba. The error message clearly indicates the problem arises from handling ambiguous time.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the presence of ambiguous time in the input date-time range during a clock change day in Cuba. The function `_get_time_bins` is unable to handle this ambiguity and, during the label creation process, encounters the AmbiguousTimeError exception. This results in a test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function used to create labels considers the ambiguous time scenario on clock change days. One approach could be to handle the AmbiguousTimeError exception explicitly and adjust the labels accordingly to avoid the error. By modifying the label creation process to account for ambiguous times, we can address this issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    try:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    except AmbiguousTimeError:
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first + Timedelta('1H'),
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adding a try-except block at the label creation step and handling the AmbiguousTimeError by adjusting the labels appropriately, we can resolve the issue. This corrected version should address the AmbiguousTimeError during resampling on clock change days in Cuba.
