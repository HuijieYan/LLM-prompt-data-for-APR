### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to handle a DatetimeIndex (`ax`) and return binner, bins, and labels accordingly.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` triggers the error `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling ambiguous time in the time bins on a clock change day.
3. The error message indicates that the problematic timestamp is '2018-11-04 00:00:00' as there are no repeated times (ambiguous).
4. The expected input/output values provided are related to handling time bins across days and during ambiguous transitions.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to handle the ambiguous time correctly during the clock change in Cuba (on '2018-11-04 00:00:00') causing the AmbiguousTimeError. It incorrectly generates the time bins, which leads to the error in the test case.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the time bins creation logic to handle ambiguous times properly during the clock change day in Cuba. Also, the bin edges need to be adjusted for the specific case of the clock change.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust the bin edges based on the time zone to handle the clock change day
    bin_edges = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)
    
    binner = labels = bin_edges

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # generate bins considering ambiguous times and handle label adjustments
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins due to ambiguous times
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the logic for handling ambiguous time during the clock change, the corrected function should now handle the test case without raising an error.
