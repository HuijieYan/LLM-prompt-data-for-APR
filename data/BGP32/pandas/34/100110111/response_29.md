## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating bins and labels for resampling time series data. In the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, the error occurs when trying to downsample data using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The bug appears to be related to handling ambiguous time during the transition from daylight saving time to standard time, causing incorrect labeling and binning of the data. This issue is illustrated by the failing test case and the corresponding error message from the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of ambiguous time in the `_get_time_bins` function. We should ensure that the time bins created are correct and do not lead to any errors related to ambiguous times.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the improper handling of ambiguous time during the transition from daylight saving time to standard time in the function `_get_time_bins`. This leads to the creation of incorrect bins and labels that result in an `AmbiguousTimeError` during down-sampling.

The function fails to properly consider the ambiguous time scenario and ends up assigning incorrect labels, leading to the error observed in the failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. The error message indicates that the system cannot infer the DST time from the timestamp, causing the failure.

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the creation of bins and labels in such a way that properly accounts for ambiguous time transitions, ensuring accurate down-sampling without errors.

## Fix Strategy
1. Enhance the handling of ambiguous time during bin creation by taking into account the transition from daylight saving time to standard time.
2. Ensure that the bins and labels generated correctly represent the time intervals without ambiguity.
3. Adjust the logic for creating bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function to accurately reflect the time series data being processed.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of ambiguous time during the creation of bins and labels, addressing the issue observed in the failing test case and the related GitHub issue.
