### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins and labels based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. The error raised in the failing test occurs due to an ambiguous time issue on the day when there is a clock change in Cuba which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The key point causing the error is `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`. This error arises from the use of `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` which leads to the ambiguous timestamp issue that pandas does not handle well.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the failure of the function to properly handle the ambiguous time due to the clock change on November 4, 2018. The function generates bin edges and labels without considering the presence of ambiguous times.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to adjust the function `_get_time_bins` to handle ambiguous time issues during the generation of bins and labels for the given `DatetimeIndex`. Specifically, when encountering ambiguous times such as those resulting from daylight saving time changes, the function should properly handle these cases and avoid triggering an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix - Updated `_get_time_bins` Function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more labels than bins due to the ambiguous time issue
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Now, the updated function includes handling ambiguous times by utilizing the parameters `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` in the construction of `binner` and `labels`. Additionally, adjustments are made to ensure labels are correctly aligned with bins when facing ambiguous time situations.

This fix aims to resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` by appropriately dealing with ambiguous times during the generation of time bins and labels. It ensures that the function can handle scenarios like the clock change in Cuba without triggering errors.
