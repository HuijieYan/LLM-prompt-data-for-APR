## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in Pandas.
2. The function first checks if the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if not.
3. It then extracts the first and last timestamps from the input `ax`, calculates the bin edges using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, and generates bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes on certain days like in Cuba.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The problem may arise when transitioning from standard time to daylight saving time or vice versa, leading to ambiguous timestamps that are not handled correctly in the code.
2. The handling of `NaT` values and adjustments made to the labels in the function might be causing an issue when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during changes from standard time to daylight saving time. The `DateRange` generation within the function `_get_time_bins` does not account for this scenario, leading to errors when trying to bin the data.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from clock changes. This can be achieved by adjusting the bin edges and labels when encountering ambiguous times.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    ...
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # Handle ambiguous timestamps
        if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._transition_info is not None:
            ambiguous_indices = ax.tz._transition_info.get('ambiguous', [])
            for idx in ambiguous_indices:
                ts = Timestamp(binner[idx], tz=ax.tz)
                binner = binner.drop(idx)
                binner = binner.insert(idx, ts.tz_localize(None))
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle ambiguous timestamps by checking for transitions in time zones and adjusting the bin edges accordingly. This should address the reported issue with daily frequency failures on clock change days.
