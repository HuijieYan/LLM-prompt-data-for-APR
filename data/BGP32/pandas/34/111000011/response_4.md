## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` inside the class `TimeGrouper` takes a DatetimeIndex `ax` as input and performs operations to generate time bins and labels.
2. The function uses the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to calculate the first and last bin edges based on the minimum and maximum values of the DatetimeIndex.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates a problem with handling ambiguous time stamps, particularly on clock change days in specific time zones.
4. The bug might be related to how the time bins are being calculated without considering ambiguous time stamps and possibly leading to errors during grouping based on daily frequency.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle ambiguous time stamps caused by clock changes in certain time zones. This can result in misaligned time bins and labels, leading to errors during grouping.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function considers the ambiguous time stamps caused by clock changes and adjusts the bin labels accordingly to avoid errors during grouping.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Ensure handling of ambiguous time stamps
    if ax.is_unique:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    else:
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        labels = binner

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle ambiguous time stamps by checking if the DatetimeIndex `ax` has unique values. If it does not, we set the ambiguous parameter to "NaT" to handle ambiguous time stamps correctly. This adjustment should help avoid errors during grouping based on daily frequency and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
