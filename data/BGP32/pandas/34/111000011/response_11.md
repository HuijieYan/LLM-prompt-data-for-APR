### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins based on the given `DatetimeIndex`. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Locations:
1. The issue is likely caused by the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
2. Utilizing `date_range` to generate bins could be problematic on days with ambiguous timestamps.
3. The adjustment of bin edges in `_adjust_bin_edges` might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the fact that the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, leading to errors when processing time bins on clock change days. The code fails to consider the intricacies of time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, enhance the logic within `_get_time_bins` to address ambiguous timestamps by considering time zone changes and daylight saving time adjustments. Use specialized functions to handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure correct bin generation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version above, `ax.floor` is used to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately. Additionally, the adjustment logic is maintained, ensuring the correct generation of time bins. This fix should address the issue in the GitHub report related to daily frequency grouping on clock change days in Cuba.
