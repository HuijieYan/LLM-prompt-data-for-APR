## Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

The buggy function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` in the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is related to the GitHub issue regarding groupby with daily frequency failing with AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba.

The `_get_time_bins` function is used to calculate time bins for grouping datetime data, but it has an issue when dealing with ambiguous timestamps, such as the ones caused by daylight saving time changes. This issue is similar to a previously fixed issue mentioned in the GitHub report #23742 but seems to persist for versions after 0.24.

The GitHub issue describes how on a long clock-change day in Cuba, the `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The expected output should be three groups, one for each day, with the problematic 4th of November being correctly labeled and containing the hourly data points for that day.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating the time bins. One approach could be to adjust the logic that generates the time bins to properly account for ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue described in the GitHub report:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # The following lines are modified to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time changes
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent='shift_forward',  # Adjust for missing times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we have added handling for ambiguous times and adjusted the `date_range` function parameters to properly handle daylight saving time changes. This fix should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
