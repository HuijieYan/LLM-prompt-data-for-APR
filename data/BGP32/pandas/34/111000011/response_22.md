### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating date bins based on given parameters.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions a problem with handling ambiguous time in a specific timezone (e.g., Cuba) during a clock change day.
3. The issue seems related to how the bins are generated for the given datetime index and the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a time change.
4. The problem might be related to how the function calculates the `binner` and `labels` based on the `first` and `last` timestamps without considering the potential ambiguity of time during clock changes.
5. The issue results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the function with time intervals that include ambiguous timestamps.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock changes in specific timezones like Cuba. The function `_get_time_bins` does not consider the potential ambiguity of time, leading to errors when generating bins for date ranges including those ambiguous timestamps.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during clock changes. This involves adjusting how the `binner` and `labels` are generated based on the timezone and potential ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    try:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    except LibNoValueError:
        # Handle ambiguous time error here
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle the AmbiguousTimeError by adding a try-except block that catches the error and adjusts the behavior to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the AmbiguousTimeError during clock change days in specific timezones like Cuba.
