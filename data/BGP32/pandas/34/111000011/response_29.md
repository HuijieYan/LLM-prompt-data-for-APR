## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is responsible for getting time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex.
2. The bug relates to date transitions on days with ambiguous time in certain timezones, which creates issues with grouping by frequency.
3. The bug is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` during groupby, especially on clock change days.
4. The bug is due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps which results in incorrect labeling and grouping.
5. The fix involves updating the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during grouping.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps during groupby on days with clock changes in specific timezones. This can lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError` as the labeling and grouping are not handled correctly on such days.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps properly during grouping.
2. Ensure that the labeling and binning of timestamps on days with ambiguous times are done correctly to avoid `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. Consider the timezone information while generating date ranges to handle transitions correctly.
4. Adjust the logic to account for days where there might be two occurrences of the same timestamp due to daylight savings changes or other time transitions.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version as outlined above, the bug related to the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days should be resolved effectively.
