### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`. The issue is related to handling ambiguous time on clock change days, specifically in Cuba. The function is generating bin edges using the `date_range` function, which causes the AmbiguousTimeError when dealing with clock changes due to the way it handles time offsets.

### Error Location:
The error in the function stems from the way bin edges are calculated using `date_range`. When transitioning between days during a clock change, the generated timestamps may become ambiguous and lead to errors during grouping.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the use of the `date_range` function in generating bin edges, which does not handle ambiguous times caused by clock changes correctly. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data on days where time might be ambiguous due to daylight saving time changes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the way bin edges are calculated to handle ambiguous times properly, especially during clock change days. Utilizing the `PeriodIndex` instead of `date_range` might provide a better solution for creating bin edges that account for ambiguous times during a clock change.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = PeriodIndex(ax, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        bins = bins + 1

    return bins[0], bins, bins
```

This version changes the approach to using `PeriodIndex` to generate time bins, ensuring that ambiguous times caused by clock changes are handled correctly. This modification should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs during grouping on clock change days like in the GitHub issue.
