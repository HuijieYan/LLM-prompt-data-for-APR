### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for defining time bins based on the input datetime index. 
2. The issue reported on GitHub revolves around the `AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs when handling time bins during a clock change day in certain time zones like Cuba.
3. The bug may occur due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous time on the clock change day and failure to assign labels appropriately for the time bins.
4. To fix the bug, it may be necessary to adjust how the time bins are created and the labels assigned when dealing with ambiguous time.
5. The correction should ensure that the time bins are accurately defined and labeled correctly for each day, including handling the ambiguous time on clock change days.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for creating bins and assigning labels to handle the ambiguous time appropriately.
2. Make sure that the labels for the bins are correctly identified, especially on clock change days.
3. Adjust the code to account for scenarios where the number of bins and labels do not match.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issue related to handling ambiguous time on clock change days and ensuring the correct labeling of time bins.
