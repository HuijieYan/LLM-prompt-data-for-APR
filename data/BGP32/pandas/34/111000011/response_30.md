### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is causing issues related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function lies in the way it handles date ranges, particularly on days with ambiguous timestamps due to time zone changes. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group data. The function fails to correctly label and handle the timestamps.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of timestamps during time zone conversions and date range generation, leading to discrepancies in the generated bins and labels. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during time zone conversions and date range creation. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for generating bins and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug and resolves the AmbiguousTimeError issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust timestamp edges directly to account for nanoseconds
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    # Create date range with proper time zone handling and labels
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins accounting for ambiguous timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins due to length mismatch
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on the clock change days in the GitHub bug report and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError.
