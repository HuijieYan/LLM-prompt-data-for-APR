### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is inside the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function is meant to get time bins based on the DatetimeIndex values passed as input.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates issues with handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in specific timezones.

### Bug Location:
The bug may be related to how the function handles timestamps during clock change days, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by the function not properly handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to errors when grouping with daily frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Since the bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, a potential fix could involve adjusting how the function generates time bins for such scenarios.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the first and last timestamps
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    # Adjust the timestamps for handling ambiguous time on clock change days
    if hasattr(first, 'floor'):  # Check if first has .floor method (timezone aware)
        first = first.floor('D')
    if hasattr(last, 'floor'):  # Check if last has .floor method (timezone aware)
        last = last.floor('D') + pd.DateOffset(days=1)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels if necessary to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function adjusts the first and last timestamps to handle ambiguous times on clock change days when generating time bins.

### Note:
This fix assumes that adjusting the timestamps to the start of the day and the next day for the last timestamp will help resolve the issue with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. Testing with specific examples similar to the one provided in the GitHub issue is recommended to validate the fix.
