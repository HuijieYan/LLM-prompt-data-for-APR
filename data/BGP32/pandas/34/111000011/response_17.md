## Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

### Buggy Function:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`. It calculates the first and last timestamps based on the input index and then generates date labels for the bins.

### Identified Issue:
The GitHub issue highlights a problem related to daily frequency grouping when there is an ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue mentions that the `pd.Grouper` does not handle this ambiguity correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error arises when there is a timestamp that is ambiguous due to a clock change (e.g., daylight saving time).

### Potential Cause of Bug:
Looking at the `_get_time_bins` function, the issue could potentially arise due to the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` without considering the potential ambiguity caused by a timestamp on a clock change day.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue and prevent `AmbiguousTimeError`, we need to adjust the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps in `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times effectively.

### Proposed Fix for the Bug:
Given the problem description and the potential cause, we should adjust the logic of calculating `first` and `last` timestamps to handle ambiguous times correctly. One way to address this is by considering the ambiguity when generating the bins. We can check for ambiguous times during label creation and adjust the labels accordingly to avoid the error.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to handle ambiguous time
    if ax.tz is not None:
        labels = labels.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we have added a step to adjust the labels for ambiguous times by localizing the labels with the timezone of the input `ax` and specifying `ambiguous='infer'` to handle ambiguous times.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to daily frequency grouping with ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba.
