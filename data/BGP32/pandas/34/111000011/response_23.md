## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The function is intended to generate time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug could be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, as described in the GitHub issue #12037.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights that when encountering ambiguous timestamps, the grouping operation raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Identified Issues:
1. The function does not handle ambiguous timestamps gracefully, which may lead to errors.
2. The function may not be adjusting the bin edges correctly during clock change days.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function's inability to handle time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps properly. When generating time bins, if the code does not consider ambiguous timestamps or adjust the bin edges accordingly for clock change days, it may lead to errors.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function properly handles ambiguous timestamps by adjusting the bin edges in a way that avoids any errors related to time zone changes.
2. Implement a mechanism to address potential issues with clock change days to prevent `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
from pytz.exceptions import AmbiguousTimeError

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        try:
            binner = labels = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first,
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
                ambiguous="infer",
                nonexistent="shift_forward",
            )
        except AmbiguousTimeError:
            if self.closed == "right":
                first -= 1
            else:
                last += 1
            binner = labels = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first,
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
                ambiguous="infer",
                nonexistent="shift_forward",
            )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function includes a try-except block to handle `AmbiguousTimeError` by adjusting the bin edges appropriately before generating the time bins. This modification aims to prevent errors related to ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, as reported in the GitHub issue.
