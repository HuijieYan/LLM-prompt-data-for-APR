## Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. The bug appears to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on days with clock change, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Potential error locations:
1. Handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change.
2. Use of `date_range` function to generate labels.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. When generating `labels` using the `date_range` function, the code does not account for this ambiguity, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for generating `labels` to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `date_range` function used to create `labels` recognizes and resolves ambiguity on clock change days.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days
    if self.freq.freqstr in ['D', 'W', 'M', 'A']:  # Check if daily, weekly, monthly, or annual frequency
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    else:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to determine if the frequency is daily, weekly, monthly, or annual. If so, we adjust the generation of labels to handle ambiguous timestamps using the 'ambiguous' argument with the value 'infer' in the `date_range` function.

This adjustment should address the issue with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, as reported in the GitHub issue.
