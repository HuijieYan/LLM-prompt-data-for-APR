### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class.
2. The function encounters issues when working with DatetimeIndexes in the presence of nanosecond parts.
3. The problem is related to the fact that calling `replace()` on `first` and `last` swallows the nanosecond part, leading to potential errors when generating date ranges.
4. The issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba" is due to similar reasons, as nanosecond parts can create ambiguous timestamps.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Issue with `replace()` method on `first` and `last`.
2. Ambiguous timestamps due to nanosecond parts.
3. Length mismatch between bins and labels.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function incorrectly uses the `replace()` method on `first` and `last`, causing nanosecond parts to be lost. This leads to the potential generation of unexpected date ranges and labels, which can result in ambiguous timestamps due to the presence of nanosecond parts.

### Strategy for Fix:
1. Avoid using `replace()` on `first` and `last` to preserve nanosecond parts.
2. Ensure that the bins and labels have the same length to prevent ambiguities in timestamps.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # gh #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        # Workaround: Make sure length of binner and labels match after insertion
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        if len(binner) > len(labels):
            labels = labels.insert(1, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we are avoiding the usage of `replace()` on `first` and `last` and ensuring that the length of `binner` and `labels` matches even after inserting `NaT` values, preventing potential issues with ambiguous timestamps.
