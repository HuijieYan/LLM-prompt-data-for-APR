### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is used to calculate time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex` using certain frequency and other parameters. The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to handling ambiguous time stamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of `first` and `last` based on the provided frequency might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. Generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` could lead to issues with ambiguous timestamps.
3. Comparison and adjustment of `bin_edges` and `ax_values`.
4. Generation of actual bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` might not consider all cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the calculation of time bins. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description specifically involves a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time on that day is ambiguous. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation of `first` and `last` considers time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. Modify the generation of `binner` and `labels` to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately.
3. Validate the comparison and adjustment of `bin_edges` and `ax_values` to accommodate all cases.
4. Update the logic for generating bins to address the issue related to clock change days in the given time zone.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor(self.freq)
    last = ax[-1].ceil(self.freq)
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` has been updated to handle ambiguous timestamps by flooring and ceiling the values respectively. Additionally, adjustments have been made in the generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` to account for the clock change day scenarios in the given time zone.
