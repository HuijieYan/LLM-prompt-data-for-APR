### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for the given datetime index.
2. The issue described on GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, which is not being handled correctly by the current implementation.
3. The bug might be related to how the function calculates the bin edges and labels based on the frequency, start, and end.
4. The function is generating bins and labels based on the provided parameters but fails to handle scenarios where there is ambiguity in the timestamps.
5. The issue could be due to incorrect handling of timezone conversions and ambiguous timestamps when creating the bins and labels.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the timestamps are handled consistently, especially around daylight savings time changes and ambiguous timestamps.
2. Modify the generation of bins and labels to correctly account for ambiguous timestamps and handle them appropriately.
3. Since the issue is related to timezone conversions and ambiguity, consider adjusting the logic for creating bins and labels in a way that avoids errors on clock change days.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    freq_offset = to_offset(self.freq)
    first = ax.min().ceil(freq_offset)
    last = ax.max().floor(freq_offset)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        name=ax.name,
        tz=ax.tz,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = DatetimeIndex([NaT] + binner)
        labels = DatetimeIndex([NaT] + labels)

    if len(binner) > len(labels):
        binner = binner[: len(labels)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses the issue by adjusting the bin edge calculation based on the provided frequency, handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, and ensuring consistency in timezone conversions.
