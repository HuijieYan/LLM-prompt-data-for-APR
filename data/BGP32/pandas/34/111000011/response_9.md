### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The function calls `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function from the same file and the class also contains another function `_adjust_bin_edges`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with handling AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.
4. The bug likely occurs due to the handling of timestamps around clock change dates when grouping data.
5. In the buggy function, the `date_range` function is used to generate time bins, and adjustments might be needed in this process to handle ambiguous times properly.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely occurring when the function `date_range` is generating time bins using the `start` and `end` timestamps around a clock change day. If the end timestamp contains nanoseconds, the last bin might be slightly before the end due to the handling of nanoseconds. This can lead to values falling after the last bin, resulting in an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the last bin's timestamp is correctly calculated to avoid the issue of values falling after the last bin. One approach could be to adjust the `end` timestamp to accurately reflect the last bin's end time while accounting for ambiguous times.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    offset = self.freq
    if self.freq.normalize().nanos == 0:  # Check if offset is at nanosecond level
        offset += 1
    end = last + offset  # Adjust the end timestamp to prevent values falling after the last bin

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, an offset is added to the `end` timestamp based on the frequency to ensure that the last bin's end time is adjusted correctly to handle ambiguous times around clock change days. This modification aims to prevent values from falling after the last bin and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
