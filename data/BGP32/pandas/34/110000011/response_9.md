### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue is related to handling ambiguous time during clock change days in certain time zones. The function fails to handle the ambiguity in timestamp, resulting in errors such as `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days.
2. Incorrect labeling of bins on the day of the clock change.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not properly handle situations where there are ambiguous timestamps due to time changes like daylight saving time transitions. This results in incorrect binning and labeling of data points, leading to errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles ambiguous timestamps during clock change days. We should consider the timezone information and adjust the binning and labeling accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for time zone on clock change days
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    if ax.tz is not None:
        # Handle ambiguous timestamps during clock changes
        ax_values = np.array([ts.tz_localize(None).value for ts in ax])

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating the adjustment for timezone and handling ambiguous timestamps properly, the corrected version of the function should now handle clock change days without raising any errors related to ambiguous time.
