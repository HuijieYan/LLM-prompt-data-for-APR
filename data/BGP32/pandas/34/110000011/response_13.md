## Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The main issue reported in the GitHub problem is related to handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the time bins are constructed when the clock change date occurs.
4. The issue results in raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation.
5. The cause of the bug is that the function does not appropriately handle ambiguous time due to a clock change.
  
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle ambiguous times that may occur during a clock change. This involves adjusting the logic to account for ambiguous timestamps, especially on the date of the time change.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # Check if the bins need adjustment for ambiguous times
        if ax.to_series().dt.tz_localize(None).index.has_duplicates:
            labels = ax.to_series().dt.tz_localize(None).index

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that if the input index contains duplicates due to ambiguity (as on a clock change day), the labels for time bins are set accordingly. This adjustment will help in handling the ambiguous timestamps during the grouping operation, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
