## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is supposed to handle time intervals for grouping, but it has a bug related to ambiguous time handling.
- The function is not properly handling cases where there are ambiguous timestamps due to daylight savings time or clock changes, leading to errors like AmbiguousTimeError.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The issue is likely related to the time zone conversion and ambiguous timestamp handling.
- Incorrect handling of time bins and labels when dealing with ambiguous times.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not account for ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins and labels. For example, on a day when there is a clock change or daylight saving time adjustment, midnight can be ambiguous. This leads to errors when generating time bins and labels, resulting in unexpected behavior like AmbiguousTimeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. We should ensure that when creating time bins and labels, the code takes into account ambiguous times and adjusts accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # account for ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.is_all_dates_unique():
        ax_values = ax_values.round('1ms')  # round to milliseconds to handle ambiguous timestamps

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By rounding timestamps to milliseconds and handling ambiguous timestamps, the corrected function should be able to generate time bins and labels correctly, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
