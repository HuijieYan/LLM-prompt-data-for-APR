### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is causing issues when dealing with ambiguous time stamps, resulting in errors like `AmbiguousTimeError` in specific scenarios, as reported in the GitHub issue related to groupby with a daily frequency during a clock change day in Cuba.

### Potential Errors:
1. Handling ambiguous timestamps during groupby operation on a daily frequency.
2. Incorrect labeling or binning when there are ambiguous timestamps.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs due to the way the function `_get_time_bins` handles ambiguous time stamps during the binning process. When dealing with ambiguous timestamps like the clock change day in Cuba, the function fails to properly assign labels and bins for the data points, leading to errors like `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to properly handle ambiguous time stamps by identifying and labeling them correctly.
2. Adjust the binning process to accommodate the data points on days with ambiguous time stamps like clock change days.
3. Ensure that the labels and bins are assigned accurately based on the unique characteristics of the data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issues related to handling ambiguous timestamps during groupby operations:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the above corrections to the `_get_time_bins` function, the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a groupby operation on a daily frequency should be more robust and prevent errors like `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba.
