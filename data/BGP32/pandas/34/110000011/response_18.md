## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for grouping; however, it is encountering issues on clock-change days in certain timezones like Cuba. The problem arises when handling ambiguous timestamps due to a lack of proper handling for such cases.

## Error Locations:
1. The issue arises when dealing with ambiguous time on clock-change days, such as the first midnight before the clock change. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised.
2. The code does not adequately handle situations where the last bin may be slightly before the end due to nanosecond precision, leading to errors.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the implementation of `_get_time_bins` function which does not consider scenarios with ambiguous timestamps and nanosecond precision. This leads to incorrect binning, especially on days with daylight savings time or clock changes.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Resolve the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days by adjusting the bin labels accordingly.
2. Implement proper handling for nanosecond precision to ensure accurate calculation of bins.
3. Ensure that the code accommodates situations where the last bin may not align perfectly due to precision issues.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        if self.freq == 'D' and ax_values[-1] - ax_values[0] < self.freq.delta:
            last = ax_values[-1]  # Adjust last based on nanosecond precision
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the `last` value based on nanosecond precision, handling ambiguous timestamps, and ensuring bin and label alignment, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to daily frequency grouping on clock-change days in timezones like Cuba.
