## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for grouping based on the frequency provided. The bug reported on GitHub involves AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of ambiguous time on clock change day.
2. Bin generation for grouping based on the provided frequency.
3. Adjustment of labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused due to the handling of ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. When generating labels and bins for grouping, the function may not appropriately consider the ambiguity in timestamps on the clock change day, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day. This involves adjusting the logic for label and bin generation to account for the ambiguity in timestamps.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_time_bins` Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name}")

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous='shift'
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous='shift'` parameter has been added to the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function call to handle the ambiguity in timestamps caused by the clock change day. This should address the reported issue of AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.
