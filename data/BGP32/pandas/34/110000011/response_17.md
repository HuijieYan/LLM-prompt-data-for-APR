### Analysis:
The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during time interval grouping, specifically on clock change days in certain time zones. The issue arises when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a day where the clock changes due to Daylight Saving Time or similar reasons. The bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when calling the `groupby` method.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error may arise from the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the creation of time bins for grouping, especially on clock change days where the local time becomes non-unique.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class does not appropriately handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This can lead to incorrect binning of timestamps resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly on clock change days. This can be achieved by adjusting the way time bins are calculated and ensuring that the bins generated cover all data points accurately.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue with ambiguous timestamps during time interval grouping:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    labels = binner.shift(1)
    labels = labels[labels.searchsorted(binner) - 1]

    # Adjust bins and labels as needed
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax.asi8)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == 'right' and self.label == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if self.closed == 'left':
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles ambiguous timestamps by flooring the timestamps to maintain consistency on clock change days, ensuring accurate grouping without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
