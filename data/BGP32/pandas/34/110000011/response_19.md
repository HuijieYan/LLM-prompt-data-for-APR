### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for the groupby operation.
- The issue reported on GitHub relates to handling AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days, specifically in the Cuba timezone.
- The problem arises when trying to handle ambiguous timestamps, causing unexpected errors during grouping.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of ambiguous timestamps when generating the time bins.
2. Adjusting labels based on frequency and closed end.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to inadequate handling of ambiguous timestamps during grouping, leading to errors in cases such as clock change days in Cuba.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the generation of time bins. Specifically, on days with clock changes where midnight is ambiguous.
- Ensure that the labels and bins adjust correctly based on the timestamp frequency and closed end.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Ensuring ambiguous times are handled appropriately
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges and axis values
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Adjust labels based on closed end
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Handle NaN values in axis
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If there are more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure proper labeling and binning, addressing the issue reported on GitHub related to AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba.
