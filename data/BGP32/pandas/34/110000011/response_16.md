### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, specifically on November 4th, a call to `groupby` raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This points to a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps during grouping.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The function does not handle ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes correctly.
2. Potential issue with labeling bins in cases where the timestamp is ambiguous.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on days when there are clock changes, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing grouping operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly by considering the timezone changes, especially during clock change days. This can be achieved by adjusting the behavior of the function `_get_time_bins` when generating bins and labels, particularly dealing with ambiguous timestamps.

### Fixed Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()

    if self.freq.n == 1:
        auto_offset = self.freq
    else:
        auto_offset = self.freq / 2

    closed = self.closed
    labels = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=closed, base=self.base, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward", name=ax.name)
    if closed == "right":
        label = date_range(start=start, periods=1, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=closed, base=self.base, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
        labels = labels[auto_offset <= label]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(labels, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles ambiguous timestamps by adjusting the bin edges and labels appropriately based on timezone information and the frequency of the bins, ensuring that the grouping operation handles days with clock changes correctly.
