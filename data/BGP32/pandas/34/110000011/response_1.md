### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas.
- The GitHub issue points out that on days when there is a clock change (e.g., Daylight Saving Time), ambiguous timestamps may cause an `AmbiguousTimeError` in the `Grouper` class.
- The code is creating bins and labels based on the start and end timestamps while handling potential issues related to nanoseconds.
- The bug may occur due to ambiguous timestamps not being handled correctly during the groupby operation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function, especially in situations like Daylight Saving Time changes.
- When the clock change occurs, the timestamps can be ambiguous, leading to incorrect binning and labels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly. One approach could be to explicitly specify how ambiguous timestamps should be handled (e.g., by choosing the first occurrence or the last occurrence). This change will ensure that the bins and labels created during the grouping operation are accurate and not affected by ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue of ambiguous timestamps:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="first",  # specify how ambiguous timestamps should be handled
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function is set to `"first"` to handle ambiguous timestamps by choosing the first occurrence. This modification should help address the issue raised in the GitHub report related to ambiguous timestamps during Daylight Saving Time changes.
