## Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub mentions that on clock change days in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, the `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps as expected, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error arises when the library does not appropriately adjust for the ambiguity in timestamps during time grouping.

## Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class where binning is done for time intervals based on frequencies. The incorrect labeling of the bins due to ambiguous timestamps might be causing the issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the handling of daylight saving time adjustments and ambiguous timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function. When the time intervals span over ambiguous timestamps, the bins are not labeled correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the labels for bins are created, taking into account ambiguous timestamps during the time binning process. Proper handling of ambiguous times and potential time skips during intervals will help resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, first, last)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        labels = self._adjust_bin_labels(ax, binner)
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
- The `self._adjust_bin_edges()` function is used to adjust the bin edges considering ambiguous timestamps.
- The `self._adjust_bin_labels()` function is called to handle proper labeling of the bins accounting for ambiguous timestamps.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately during time grouping, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported on GitHub.
