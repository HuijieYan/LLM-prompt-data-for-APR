### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is responsible for generating time bins for grouping based on the input axis provided. The bug seems to cause issues with handling ambiguous timestamps, leading to errors like the `AmbiguousTimeError` described in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of ambiguous timestamps in the input axis `ax`.
2. Adjustment of bin edges using `_adjust_bin_edges` method.
3. Generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from the function's inability to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. In scenarios like clock change days in certain time zones (e.g., Cuba), where midnight local time may be ambiguous, the function fails to handle this situation correctly, leading to errors during grouping by time intervals.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement a mechanism to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, ensuring that time bins are generated correctly without causing errors related to ambiguous times.
2. Enhance the logic related to adjusting bin edges to consider potential ambiguous timestamps and adjust them accordingly.
3. Improve the generation of bins to account for scenarios where the input axis may contain ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes enhancements to handle ambiguous timestamps during bin generation, ensuring that the function can handle scenarios like clock change days in specific time zones without causing errors.
