### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The function is used to create time bins for the given DatetimeIndex.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect check for the type of the input `ax`.
2. Incorrect handling or adjustment of bin edges.
3. Mistake in generating bins based on relative frequencies.
4. Incorrect slicing of labels based on closed and label parameters.
5. Incorrect handling of NaN values in the ax.
6. Potential issue with the number of bins and labels.

### Bug Cause:
The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised when trying to infer daylight saving time (DST) at midnight. This error is likely caused by incorrect adjustments of bin edges, leading to ambiguous time determination.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify the input type of `ax` correctly.
2. Ensure proper adjustment of bin edges without losing nanoseconds.
3. Adjust the generation of bins based on relative frequencies to avoid ambiguities.
4. Correct the slicing of labels based on closed and label parameters.
5. Handle NaN values appropriately in the ax.
6. Validate the number of bins and labels to avoid inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Adjust bin generation based on relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_for_time(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, self.freq, self.base, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label parameters
    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Handle NaN values appropriately
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Validate the number of bins and labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By correcting the adjustments of bin edges, generating bins based on relative frequencies, handling NaN values, and validating the number of bins and labels, the corrected `_get_time_bins` function should address the reported issue.
