### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module.
2. The failing test is trying to downsample data and group it by day using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`, which eventually leads to calling the `_get_time_bins` function.
3. The failing test produces an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to issues with time zone conversion and handling of ambiguous times within the `_get_time_bins` function.
4. The bug is likely happening when creating the date range within the `_get_time_bins` function as it's related to time zone localization and ambiguous time handling.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper time zone handling and avoid ambiguous times when creating date ranges in the `_get_time_bins` function.

### Proposed Fix:
Given the context and the error message, the bug is likely related to ambiguous time handling during time zone conversion. To address this issue, it's necessary to handle ambiguous times correctly. One approach would be to use the `ambiguous` parameter in the date range creation to handle ambiguous times explicitly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous='NaT',  # Handle ambiguous times explicitly
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling ambiguous times as 'NaT', we mitigate the `AmbiguousTimeError` when creating the date range and ensure a correct grouping of data by day. This updated version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
