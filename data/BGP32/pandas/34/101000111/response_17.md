### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the given `ax` (DatetimeIndex) and other parameters.
- The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on days with a clock change, and the function fails to process such cases properly.
- The issue arises on days like 2018-11-04 in Cuba due to ambiguous timestamps around the clock change.
- The problem involves the calculation of `first` and `last` values without considering the ambiguous timestamps, leading to incorrect binning and group formation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the current function occurs due to not handling ambiguous timestamps around the clock change day properly. In the provided test case, the date 2018-11-04 has an ambiguous timestamp where the clock changes from -04:00 to -05:00.
- The function doesn't address this ambiguity while creating the bins, leading to errors and incorrect binning results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issue:
1. Handle the ambiguous timestamps around the clock change day appropriately when creating the bins and labels.
2. Ensure that the timestamps are correctly adjusted while generating the bin edges and labels.
3. Implement a fix in the `_get_time_bins` function to consider the ambiguous timestamps when creating bins and labels.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq
    binner = [
        Timestamp(ts, tz=ax.tz)
        for ts in date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    ]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, considering ambiguous timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of ambiguous timestamps around the clock change day and ensures correct binning behavior as expected in the provided test case and GitHub issue.
