To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to address the issue caused by ambiguous timestamps, as described in the GitHub issue. The problem arises due to how the function handles the timestamp range edges on clock change days. We need to modify the timestamp generation to handle this edge case correctly.

Here is the corrected and updated version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handling timestamp range edges for clock change days
    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq

    # Generating bins and labels
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we handle the timestamp range edges `first` and `last` by directly taking the first and last elements from `ax` and adjusting the `last` timestamp by adding the frequency. This approach ensures that the timestamp on the clock change day is correctly accounted for. The remaining logic for generating bins and labels remains the same.

This corrected function should now correctly handle the issue reported on the GitHub bug regarding AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba. It accommodates the timestamp edge cases during clock changes and generates the appropriate time bins and labels as expected.
