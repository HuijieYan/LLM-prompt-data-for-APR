### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is encountering an issue due to the handling of AmbiguousTimeError during daylight saving time changes, specifically in Cuba. The function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly to avoid throwing an error. The bug is impacting the grouping results for daily frequencies with ambiguous timestamps.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, especially in handling ambiguous times during the daylight saving time change in the provided timezone. The error is due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of timestamps during the daylight saving time change in the `date_range` call. Since the timestamps are ambiguous on those days, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised. The bug affects the grouping functionality for `TimeGrouper`.

### Strategy to Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps properly during daylight saving time changes. This involves modifying the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times correctly, considering the provided timezone. We must ensure that the `binner` and `labels` generated do not contain ambiguous timestamps to avoid errors.

### Code Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This fix ensures that ambiguous times are handled correctly by inserting NaT values during the `date_range` creation, resolving the AmbiguousTimeError issue. The corrected function should now produce the expected results for the provided test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to grouping with daily frequencies during daylight saving time changes in Cuba.
