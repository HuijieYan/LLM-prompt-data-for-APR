## Fixing the Bug

### Potential Error Locations
1. Issue with the calculation of `binner` and `labels`: The current code calculates `binner` and `labels` directly from `date_range`, which may lead to incorrect results.
2. Error handling and adjustment of labels: The code currently does not handle cases where the number of bins and labels do not match, leading to potential errors.
3. Issue with handling NaN values: The code inserts `NaT` in the `binner` and `labels` arrays when `ax.hasnans` is `True`, but this may not be correct in all cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` fails to correctly generate binner, bins, and labels for group calculation, leading to errors during grouping. It fails to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially around midnight on clock change days, resulting in the mentioned GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for generating `binner`, `labels`, and handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately. We should adjust the calculation for `binner` and `labels` based on the frequency and handle cases where the number of bins and labels do not match. Additionally, we need to ensure correct handling of NaN values in the arrays.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    labels = binner.copy()

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        labels = labels[bin_edges.size - bins.size :]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above, ensuring proper generation of `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`, while handling ambiguous timestamps and NaN values correctly. It should resolve the bug related to grouping with daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba and align with the expected input/output values.
