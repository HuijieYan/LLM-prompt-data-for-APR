## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The issue arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba when using the `pd.Grouper` function. The function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is involved in generating bins based on the provided datetime index. The code does not appropriately handle the situation when there are ambiguous timestamps due to clock change.

### Error Location:
The issue is likely occurring in the creation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`, leading to problems with ambiguous timestamps. The incorrect handling of time zones and ambiguity is causing the error during grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inadequate handling of ambiguous timestamps during a time zone change or clock change day, specifically the transition from daylight saving time to standard time. Failure to appropriately adjust for the time change results in incorrect binner and label creation, throwing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the `start` and `end` timestamps before passing them to `date_range` to consider the ambiguity during time zone changes.
2. Properly handle ambiguous timestamps to avoid errors during grouping.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    start = ax.min().tz_convert(ax.tz).tz_localize(None)  # Adjust for ambiguity
    end = ax.max().tz_convert(ax.tz).tz_localize(None)    # Adjust for ambiguity

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        start, end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        tz=ax.tz
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

### Summary:
The corrected function adjusts for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba and now properly handles the time zone changes during grouping. This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered during the `pd.Grouper` function when dealing with daily frequency on clock change days.
