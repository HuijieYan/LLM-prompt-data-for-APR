The bug in the provided function is causing issues related to handling ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day. The bug results in raising an AmbiguousTimeError during the groupby operation, preventing correct grouping based on the given frequencies.

### Error in the Bug
The bug is in the `_get_time_bins` function in the calculation and handling of timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba. The incorrect timestamps lead to ambiguous time errors and incorrect groupings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamps are handled correctly, especially during the clock change day. By adjusting the timestamps and bin edges with the appropriate logic, we can avoid ambiguous time errors and ensure proper groupings based on the specified frequency.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function ensures proper handling of timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba, preventing ambiguous time errors and generating the expected grouping based on the specified frequencies.

By using this corrected version of the function, the issue reported on GitHub related to AmbiguousTimeError during the clock change day in Cuba while using the `groupby` operation should be resolved.
