Based on the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect calculation of the `last` timestamp in the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue specifically mentioned the problem with handling ambiguous timestamps such as the midnight time during a clock change day in Cuba.

The incorrect calculation of the `last` timestamp in the line:
```python
end=last,
```
could lead to the last bin being slightly before the actual end time, causing the error related to values falling after the last bin and not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

To fix the bug, we should avoid calling `replace()` on the `first` and `last` timestamps, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Instead, we should use the `first` and `last` directly to retain the nanosecond part of the timestamps.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using `first` and `last` directly in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` without calling `replace()`, the corrected version of the function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
