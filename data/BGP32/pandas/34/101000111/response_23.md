The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to how it handles the timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The function fails to correctly determine the bin edges and labels for the groupings leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The key issue is with the calculation of the first and last timestamps for the bins.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated to avoid ambiguity on clock change days. We should not use the `replace()` function, as it can swallow the nanosecond part and cause inaccuracies.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use floor and ceil to avoid ambiguity on clock change days
    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version calculates the `first` timestamp by flooring the minimum timestamp and the `last` timestamp by ceiling the maximum timestamp with the given frequency. This ensures that there is no ambiguity on the day of the clock change, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
