### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to generate time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`. It calculates the first and last timestamp based on the given `DatetimeIndex`, then creates a range of datetime values according to the provided frequency, adjusting bin edges, and generating bins correspondingly.
   
2. The issue identified in the GitHub problem description pertains to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days. Particularly, the problem arises when midnight local time is ambiguous, causing `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could be related to how the function handles ambiguous local times on clock-change days. The use of `date_range` without handling ambiguous times can lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError` as described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should handle ambiguous times explicitly, ensuring that the function deals with the transition correctly. One way to address this is by accounting for ambiguous times during the generation of bin edges and labels.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with a fix to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="shift",  # Handle ambiguous times by shifting
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version explicitly handles ambiguous times by setting `ambiguous="shift"` in the `date_range` function call, which should help in preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping on clock-change days.

By making this adjustment, the function should now handle the described issue in the GitHub report and correctly return the expected time bins.
