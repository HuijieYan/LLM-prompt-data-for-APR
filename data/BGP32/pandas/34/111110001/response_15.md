### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating time bins for resampling time series data.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect labeling of time bins, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data by day.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with inferring daylight saving time from a specific timestamp, which is likely caused by incorrect handling of time zones or bin labeling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins are correctly labeled based on the specified frequency and time zone, avoiding any ambiguous time situations.
5. The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # Other methods in the class remain unchanged

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first.floor(freq=self.freq),
            end=last.ceil(freq=self.freq),
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version ensures that the time bins are properly labeled without causing any ambiguous time errors when grouping time series data. The adjustments made include using `first.floor()` and `last.ceil()` to determine the start and end of each bin correctly, based on the specified frequency. Additionally, potential edge cases that could lead to ambiguous time errors have been addressed.
