### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class and is called when trying to group a DataFrame by a date frequency.
2. The function extracts the range of timestamps from the input DatetimeIndex and generates bins and labels for the grouping process.
3. The failing test is related to down-sampling a DataFrame grouped by a date frequency, encountering an error related to ambiguous time conversion during the date_range generation.
4. The error occurs when localizing time zones and converting to another time zone, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
5. The bug seems to be related to the time zone handling while creating binner and labels for the grouping process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time zone conversion in the `_get_time_bins` function. In the implementation, when creating the `binner` and `labels` for the groupby process, the time zone localization and conversion are not handled correctly, leading to ambiguous time errors during date_range generation.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that time zones are correctly handled when generating the bin edges and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. Specifically, we should ensure that the time zone information is preserved during the range generation process to avoid ambiguous time errors.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.freq.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now properly handle time zone information for generating the bin edges and labels, avoiding ambiguous time errors during date_range generation.
