1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for generating time bins for grouping time-series data. The error message indicates that there is an issue related to ambiguous time during daylight saving time transitions.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function and subsequent adjustments based on the time zone and handling of daylight saving time.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the generation of time bins based on the time zone of the input data during daylight saving time transitions. The error message `AmbiguousTimeError` suggests that the time specified is ambiguous and cannot be inferred due to repeated times during the transition. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous times in the `date_range` function call.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins account for ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions. One potential strategy is to use the `date_range` function with the `ambiguous` parameter set to `True` to handle ambiguous time resolution automatically.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to `"infer"`, the corrected version should be able to handle ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
