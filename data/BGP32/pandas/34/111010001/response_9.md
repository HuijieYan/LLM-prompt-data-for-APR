1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file, which is responsible for creating time bins for resampling. This function uses another function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` from the same file to get the first and last timestamps for the bins. The function then uses `date_range` to generate bins based on these timestamps.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function could be in how the timestamps for the bins are obtained or generated using `date_range`.

3. The error message indicates an issue with an ambiguous time error while converting timestamps. This error occurs when trying to infer the daylight saving time (dst) from a specific timestamp.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time error and ensure that the timestamps for the bins are generated without causing any ambiguity during the conversion. One possible strategy could be to handle the ambiguous time error explicitly in the code by providing a safe fallback in case of ambiguity.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by shifting them to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, we handle ambiguous times by setting `ambiguous="NaT"` in the `date_range` call. This will shift any ambiguous times to 'NaT' (Not-a-Time) instead of raising an error, avoiding the ambiguity issue during timestamp generation for the bins.
