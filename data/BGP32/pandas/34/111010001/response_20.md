1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is causing the error message related to an ambiguous time error. The error is raised due to the inability to infer daylight saving time (dst) from a specific timestamp.

2. One potential error location is in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, which can possibly introduce the ambiguity in time due to the use of different time zone elements.

3. The bug is caused by the way `date_range` is called with potentially ambiguous timing information, which results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The `date_range` function is used to generate a range of dates between `start` and `end`, but if the time zone information is not handled correctly, it can lead to ambiguous timestamps. The error message indicates that the function cannot infer dst time because there are no repeated times, highlighting the issue with ambiguous time calculation.

4. To fix the bug and avoid the ambiguous time error, it is important to ensure that the time zone handling is accurate and that the timestamps being used do not lead to ambiguity. One strategy to address this is to explicitly handle the time zone conversions and ensure that daylight saving time transitions are taken into account.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',
        nonexistent='shift_forward',
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == 'right':
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous='infer'` parameter is explicitly set in the `date_range` function call to handle ambiguous times appropriately. Additionally, a check for NaN values is performed to prevent any inconsistencies in handling labels and bins.
