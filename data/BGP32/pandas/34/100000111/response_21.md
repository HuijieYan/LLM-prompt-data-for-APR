### Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling time bins and labels during the process of resampling. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that this bug leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days, specifically in Cuba. The function is supposed to create bins and labels for resampling but fails to handle the ambiguity in timestamps correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function creates `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function with the frequency specified in `self.freq`. This results in the creation of bins and labels for resampling based on the start and end timestamps extracted from the input `ax`.
   
2. The bug arises when there's a clock change at midnight local time, making the timestamps ambiguous. The function does not handle this ambiguity correctly, leading to an error during the resampling process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the issue described on GitHub, the function needs to take into account the ambiguity in timestamps, especially on clock change days. This can be achieved by modifying how the bins and labels are created to ensure that the timestamps are correctly assigned to the appropriate bins.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on the frequency and handling of ambiguous times
    labels = binner.copy()
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version now properly handles the ambiguity in timestamps, ensuring that the function works correctly for resampling, as expected in the GitHub issue scenario.

By incorporating the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the creation of bins and labels, this fix addresses the root cause of the bug and ensures the function aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
