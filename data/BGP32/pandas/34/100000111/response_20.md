### Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to arise from the way it handles time boundaries during the clock change day in Cuba. The function fails to address the ambiguity in timestamps correctly, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem statement with `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Error Location:
The main issue lies in how the function calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps and how it generates the `binner` and `labels` arrays.

### Bug Explanation:
During a clock change day in Cuba, where there is an ambiguous timestamp, the function fails to handle the transition correctly. This results in misaligned bins and labels, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps to consider the ambiguous time correctly.
2. Ensure that `binner`, `labels`, and other generated arrays align properly with the time boundaries to avoid the ambiguous timestamp error.
3. Handle the clock change day scenario explicitly to account for the transition.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor("D")  # Adjust time to the start of the day
    last = ax.max().ceil("D")    # Adjust time to the end of the day

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the clock change day issue in Cuba by adjusting the time boundaries correctly and ensuring proper alignment of bins and labels. It should now handle the ambiguous timestamps without raising `AmbiguousTimeError` as described in the GitHub issue.
