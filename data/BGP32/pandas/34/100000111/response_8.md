### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` takes multiple parameters and is aimed at processing datetime-related data for time resampling.
2. The function needs to handle datetime data accurately, especially in scenarios like clock changes.
3. The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue highlights the failure in handling AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba due to an issue with grouping by daily frequency.
4. The function creates time bins based on the input datetime index, frequency, and other parameters.

### Bug
The bug lies in the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change in Cuba, leading to errors when grouping by daily frequency.

### Fix Strategy
To address the issue, we need to ensure that the time bins created respect the day boundaries correctly, especially during ambiguous time periods like clock changes. Adjustment of labels and bins based on the frequency and timezone information is critical for correct grouping.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Ensure correct handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zones
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        normalize=True  # Normalize to avoid ambiguity
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted time edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match bin count if necessary
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function includes adjustments for handling ambiguous timestamps during clock changes and ensuring correct day boundaries for grouping by daily frequency.

This fix aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba while grouping with daily frequency.
