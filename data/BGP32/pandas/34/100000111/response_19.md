### Fixing the Bug

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the handling of ambiguous time during a clock change in Cuba. The `pd.Grouper` does not handle this scenario as expected, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue arises when trying to group data based on daily frequency on days with a clock change, resulting in unexpected behavior.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the timestamp range accounts for ambiguous times during the clock change by correctly setting the `first` and `last` timestamps.
2. Adjust the bin edges according to the actual data distribution to account for the ambiguous time.
3. Maintain the frequency consistency throughout the process to handle the binning correctly.

#### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function accounts for the potential ambiguity during the clock change while ensuring correct binning based on the provided frequency.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle the issue reported on GitHub related to daily grouping with a clock change in Cuba correctly.
