### Analysis
The bug seems to occur due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba. The `ax` input is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`, and the function `_get_time_bins` should return `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` after processing the input. However, the issue arises during the creation of `binner` and `labels` for the output, leading to incorrect bin assignment and raising the `Values falls after last bin` error.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because on a clock change day, the timestamp for midnight is ambiguous, causing misalignment between the bins and labels. Specifically, the labels for the bins might not match the actual data distribution due to timezone differences and daylight saving time.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we should handle situations where the clock change leads to ambiguous timestamps. Adjusting the bin edges and labels is necessary based on the expected output, taking into account the timezone differences and potential timestamp discrepancies.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor("D")
    last = ax.max().ceil("D")
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly and align the bins and labels appropriately, addressing the issue raised on GitHub (`AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba`).
