## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when there is an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is crucial in handling datetime indices and generating bins during resampling. The bug is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Identification
1. The function checks if `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, which is correct.
2. The function calculates `first` and `last` timestamps correctly but might encounter an issue with ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in some timezones.
3. The function constructs `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` which can be problematic if ambiguous timestamps are not handled properly.
4. The function adjusts bin edges `bin_edges` based on `ax_values`, but the adjustment may introduce errors if not handled carefully.
5. The function uses `lib.generate_bins_dt64` to generate bins but might not account for potential issues related to ambiguous timestamps.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the improper handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically during a clock change day leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. The function needs to ensure that the bins and labels are correctly aligned with the ambiguous timestamps without omitting any data points during the clock change.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days.
2. Adjust the bin edges and labels to include all data points accurately.
3. Verify that `lib.generate_bins_dt64` accurately creates the bins considering potential timestamp ambiguities.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function ensures proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days and accurately aligns bins and labels with the data points. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue.
