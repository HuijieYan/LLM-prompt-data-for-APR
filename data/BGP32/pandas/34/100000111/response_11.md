### Analysis:
The bug likely originates from the handling of the timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba, specifically related to the AmbiguousTimeError. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where the call to groupby raises this error due to the ambiguity present in the timestamps.

### Identified Errors:
1. The issue arises due to the handling of timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.
2. Insufficient adjustments in the labeling of the bins and labels which can cause misalignment due to the ambiguous timestamp.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change, leading to errors when grouping data on that specific day.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion and handling of timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba are correctly managed. Additionally, adjustments in the labeling process should be made to account for any ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly and don't replace them to avoid swalloing nanoseconds
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba. It ensures proper handling of the timestamps and adjusts the labeling process to prevent misalignments caused by ambiguous timestamps.
