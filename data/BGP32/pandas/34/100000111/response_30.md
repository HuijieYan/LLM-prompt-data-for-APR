### Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `groupby` function fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba due to how `pd.Grouper` handles timestamps. The provided buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the resampling functionality of Pandas, and it seems to be generating time bins incorrectly. The problem is likely due to how timestamps are handled around the clock change period.

### Error Location
The issue in the buggy function seems to stem from the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`. The handling of ambiguous time during the clock change day is not properly considered in setting up the bins.

### Cause of Bug
The bug is causing incorrect labeling and handling of timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The function's current implementation does not properly address the ambiguity in time during the clock transition, leading to incorrect bin labels and overlapping bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how `binner` and `labels` are created in the `_get_time_bins` function. It is essential to handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day correctly, ensuring that the bins and labels do not overlap or have incorrect timestamps.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function based on the identified issue and expected input/output values:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="comply", nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    bin_edges = np.zeros(2 * len(binner) - 1)
    bin_edges[0::2] = binner
    bin_edges[1::2] = binner[1:]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner[1::2] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = DatetimeIndex([NaT] + binner, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
        labels = DatetimeIndex([NaT] + labels, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.
