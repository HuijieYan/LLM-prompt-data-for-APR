### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. In the provided expected case, the function is expected to handle a scenario involving clock changes, specifically in Cuba on November 4th, 2018. The bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on that specific day during the groupby operation.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to arise due to the improper handling of ambiguous timestamps around the time of the clock change on November 4th, 2018, in Cuba. Specifically, the issue occurs during the creation of `binner` and `labels` when generating time bins between `first` and `last` with `date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely occurs because the `date_range` function used to create `binner` and `labels` does not handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly on the day of the clock change. This leads to discrepancies resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data based on time bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function handles the ambiguous timestamps correctly during the generation of `binner` and `labels` to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The updated function now uses `date_range` to generate both `binner` and `labels`, ensuring consistent handling of ambiguous timestamps. This adjustment should prevent the occurrence of the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.
