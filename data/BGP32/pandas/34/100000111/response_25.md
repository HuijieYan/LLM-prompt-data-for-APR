### Bug Analysis:
The issue described in GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day, specifically in the context of time grouping operations. The bug occurs when attempting to group data by daily frequency that includes a clock-changing day, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely arises in the `_get_time_bins` function, particularly during the creation of the `binner` and `labels` for time bins. Handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time on the clock-change day seems to be the root cause of the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `date_range` function used to create `binner` and `labels` does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly. This leads to incorrect labeling of time bins and subsequent errors when grouping data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps on the clock-change day.
2. Adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` to account for ambiguous times and prevent errors during grouping operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Avoid using replace() to maintain nanosecond precision on the last bin
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using proper handling of ambiguous times
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or (self.closed == "left" and self.label == "right"):
        labels = labels[1:]
        
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function includes adjustments to properly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days and ensure correct labeling of time bins. It aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub post related to grouping with daily frequency on critical clock-change days.
