### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to create time bins for resampling purposes.
- The issue described in the GitHub problem is related to ambiguous time on the day of a clock change in Cuba.
- The issue is due to improper handling of ambiguous times during the creation of time bins.
- The function calculates the first and last timestamps for the time bins, but the handling of nanosecond precision and ambiguous times is not done correctly.
- The algorithm used for binning and label adjustments also needs to be corrected to handle the ambiguous times properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. When calculating the first and last timestamps, ensure that the nanosecond part is preserved.
2. Adjust the bin edges correctly to handle the ambiguous times without losing precision.
3. Update the label adjustment logic to consider the ambiguous timestamp properly.
4. Handle the case of inserting `NaT` values when `ax.hasnans` is `True`.
5. Adjust the labels if the number of labels exceeds the number of bins.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function includes fixes to handle ambiguous times and adjust the time bins and labels accordingly.

This fix should address the issue related to ambiguous times on clock change days in Cuba as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
