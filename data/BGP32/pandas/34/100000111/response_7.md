### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins for resampling in Pandas. The issue reported on GitHub relates to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, specifically focusing on Cuba's time zone. The bug seems to affect the correct grouping of data due to the improper handling of ambiguous timestamps.

### Identified Error:
The bug arises from not properly handling ambiguous timestamps caused by a clock change. This leads to incorrect grouping of data and raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug's primary cause is the failure to adjust the time bins correctly when there are ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days like the one mentioned in the issue related to Cuba's time zone.

### Strategy for Fix:
To resolve the bug, it is necessary to adjust the time bins properly to handle the ambiguous timestamps. This involves ensuring that the grouping is done accurately without raising errors related to ambiguous times.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels to handle more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function should now handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, ensuring correct grouping of data without raising errors related to ambiguous times.
