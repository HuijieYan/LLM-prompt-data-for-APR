### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
- The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a clock change day issue when grouping by daily frequency in certain timezones like Cuba.
- The problematic section seems to be when creating the date range where the timezone localization is causing the issue.
- The GitHub issue details a similar problem with clock-change days in Cuba.
- The expectation is to have three groups for each day: 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November.
- The bug occurs because the date range generation doesn't handle ambiguous times properly on clock-change days in the given timezone.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to the handling of ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions in certain timezones.
- In this specific case, on the clock-change day in Cuba, the date range generation does not properly account for the ambiguity in timestamps.
- The use of `tz=ax.tz` during the generation of the date range without proper handling of ambiguous times leads to the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the AmbiguousTimeError on clock-change days, we need to update how the timezone localization is applied during date range generation. Specifically, we should explicitly handle ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Update timezone handling for ambiguous times
    loc_tz = ax.tz.localize(Timestamp(first, tz=ax.tz).to_pydatetime())
    binner = binner.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(loc_tz, ambiguous="NaT")

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling ambiguous times during the timezone localization step, we aim to address the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock-change days. This correction should ensure proper grouping by daily frequency on days with daylight saving transitions.
