### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class but mistakenly called as `groupby._get_time_bins()`.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the timestamp around the change of time due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) in Cuba.
3. The bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` because the code doesn't handle the situation where the timezone change results in ambiguous times.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adapt the code to be more aware of ambiguous times during timezone changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the code not handling ambiguous time arising from the timezone change on the clock change day in Cuba when creating the bins for grouping.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
1. Adjust the code to handle the ambiguous time issue during the timezone change.
2. Specifically, ensure that the first bin remains inclusive of the ambigous timestamp while still capturing all the data points correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges ,labels = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, labels)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes the adjustment needed to handle the ambiguous time during timezone changes, ensuring correct bin creation for grouping.
