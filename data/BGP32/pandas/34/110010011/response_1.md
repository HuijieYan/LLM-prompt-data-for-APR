### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a clock change day in Cuba.
- The GitHub issue explains that the expectation is to have three groups, one for each day, and to correctly label the group for the ambiguous timestamp.
- The bug arises from the usage of `date_range` function which is not handling the ambiguous timestamp properly.

### Error Cause:
- The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is caused by the `date_range` function being unable to handle the ambiguity of timestamps during clock change days.
- The error message mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the inability to infer DST time on the ambiguous timestamp during the clock change day in Cuba.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the date range is generated to properly handle the ambiguity of timestamps during clock change days.
- Specifically, we need to adjust the generation of date range to handle ambiguous timezones and labels correctly for the grouped data.
- We can modify the logic to properly deal with ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the expected grouping and labeling are achieved.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change days
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous time as NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering timezone ambiguity
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By modifying the `ambiguous` parameter to handle ambiguous time as `NaT` in the `date_range` function call, we can address the issue of ambiguous timestamps during clock change days in Cuba. The corrected version should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and correctly label the grouped data during such time shifts.
