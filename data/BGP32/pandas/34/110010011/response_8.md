### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample.py` file.
- The error message received indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions on a specific date.
- The GitHub issue mentioned is related to handling daily frequency with DST transitions in Cuba leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The issue arises on long clock-change days like November 4th when midnight is an ambiguous timestamp due to DST changes.
- The problem occurs while calling the `groupby` method with a frequency of 1 day.

### Error Cause:
- The error occurs due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions, specifically on November 4th in this case.
- When trying to bin the data with a frequency of 1 day, an ambiguous timestamp is encountered during the bin creation process.
- This ambiguity leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` as the system cannot infer the DST time.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To resolve the issue, we can handle the ambiguous timestamps caused by DST transitions more robustly by adjusting the logic during bin creation.
- One approach is to explicitly manage the transition between the last hour before DST ends and the first hour after DST ends to avoid ambiguous timestamps.
- By excluding the ambiguous hour (e.g., 00:00:00) from the binning process, we can prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

### Updated Function after Fix:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        # Adjusting for ambiguous timestamp during DST transitions
        if ax.normalize().tz_localize(None).time() != pd.Timestamp("00:00:00").time():
            binner = labels = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first,
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
                ambiguous="infer",
                nonexistent="shift_forward",
            )
        else:
            binner = labels = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
                ambiguous="infer",
                nonexistent="shift_forward",
            )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # If we end up with more labels than bins
        # Adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

The updated function now explicitly handles ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions by skipping the ambiguous midnight hour to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This way, the function should be able to group the data correctly without encountering the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
