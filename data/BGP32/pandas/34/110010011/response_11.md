### 1. Analysis:
- **Buggy function**: `_get_time_bins`
- **Buggy class**: `TimeGrouper`
- **Error message**: `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`
- **GitHub issue**: The issue is related to handling daily frequency with ambiguous times during clock change days in Cuba.

### 2. Potential error locations:
- The error seems related to how the bins and labels are created for time grouping.
- Specifically, the issue arises when dealing with ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day.

### 3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the usage of `date_range` to create bins and labels for time groupings.
- During a clock change day with ambiguous times, the `date_range` function doesn't handle the ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### 4. Strategy to fix the bug:
- Adjust the logic for creating bins and labels to handle ambiguous times better.
- Ensure that the bins and labels generated are correct and consistent during clock change days.

### 5. Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the start and end without losing nanoseconds
    first, last = ax.nanos[0], ax.nanos[-1]
    start = pd.Timestamp(first.astype('datetime64[ns]'), tz=ax.tz)
    end = pd.Timestamp(last.astype('datetime64[ns]'), tz=ax.tz)

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on frequency and closed
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should handle ambiguous times during clock change days properly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and passing the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
