### Error Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises when handling an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba. The error message indicates that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the interpretation of the timestamp. This bug is associated with GitHub issue #25758.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Generating bins and labels using `date_range`.
2. Handling ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly generating date ranges that may lead to ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day. The timestamp `2018-11-04 00:00:00` in Havana timezone is ambiguous, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly by providing a solution to deal with the ambiguous hour during the clock change, such as incorporating additional logic to ensure that labels are created correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()

        # adjust for possible ambiguous midnight on clock change day
        if len(ax.unique()) != len(ax):
            last -= Timedelta(seconds=1)

        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are adjusted to handle the possible ambiguous midnight on a clock change day. This adjustment ensures that the labels are created correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
