### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with handling ambiguous time during a clock change, specifically in the context of a daily frequency groupby operation. The error seems to be related to the handling of timestamps around the transition time during daylight saving time changes.

The bug is most likely caused by the incorrect handling of time labeling and binning around ambiguous timestamps on days of a clock change.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the insufficient handling of ambiguous times when generating time bins and labels during a daily frequency groupby operation. Specifically, on days with daylight saving time changes, like in the given example, the code does not properly handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time or vice versa.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle ambiguous times during clock changes. This can be achieved by using appropriate functions that consider the specifics of time transitions in the given timezone, especially when generating time labels and bins.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter in the date_range function is set to "NaT" to explicitly handle ambiguous times by replacing them with 'Not-a-Time' values. Additionally, proper adjustments are made for bins and labels to ensure consistent handling of time transitions, resolving the issue with daily frequency groupby operations on days with ambiguous times.
