### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for grouping based on the frequency specified.
2. The error message from the failing test suggests that an `AmbiguousTimeError` occurs due to the DST transition on the day of the clock change in Cuba (November 4th).
3. The issue on GitHub clarifies that on such a day, the first midnight timestamp is ambiguous, which is not handled correctly by the grouping operation.
4. The bug arises from using `tz-localized` timestamps on DST transition days, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The function should account for this edge case to avoid errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle ambiguous timezones during DST transitions. One approach is to adjust the logic for generating time bins to consider the ambiguity and ensure the correct grouping.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for ambiguous timezones during DST transitions
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Infer ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the updated logic to handle ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions, this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue while grouping on such days.
