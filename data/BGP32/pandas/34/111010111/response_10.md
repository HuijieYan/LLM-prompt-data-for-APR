### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to calculate bins, bin edges, and labels for time grouping.
2. The code raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling timezones during a clock change in Cuba.
3. The issue is triggered due to handling ambiguous timestamps incorrectly around the clock change time on a specific day in Cuba.
4. The code fails to adjust for the ambiguous timestamp, leading to the unexpected error.
5. The GitHub issue confirms this bug and expects the grouping operation to proceed smoothly without raising errors during ambiguous time handling.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the failure to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during the clock change event in the specified timezone (Cuba). The code attempts to create bin edges and labels without considering the ambiguity of time around the clock change, leading to incorrect labeling and subsequent errors.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Detect the ambiguous timestamp around the problematic clock change day.
2. Handle the ambiguous timestamp appropriately during the calculation of bins, bin edges, and labels.
3. Adjust the logic around timestamp adjustment to ensure smooth grouping operation across the clock change day.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Adjust for the ambiguous timestamp near the clock change
    first, last = first.tz_localize(None), last.tz_localize(None)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the function now handles ambiguous timestamps properly, ensuring a smooth grouping operation in scenarios like the clock change day in Cuba without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
