### Analyzing the buggy function and the issue:

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is called to generate time bins for groupby operation. The issue arises when dealing with ambiguous time on clock-change days, such as in the provided GitHub issue.

2. The function first checks the type of the input `ax` to ensure it's a `DatetimeIndex`. Then, it calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps based on the min and max values of `ax`, and generates `binner` and `labels` for that range. The function also performs some adjustment of bin edges and generates bins using the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function.

3. Based on the provided error message, the specific problem occurs due to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the call to `date_range` within the function `_get_time_bins`. This error arises when transitioning between standard and daylight time, as described in the GitHub issue. The expectation is to properly handle ambiguous times and generate the correct bins and labels.

4. To address the bug and handle the ambiguous time correctly, we need to adjust the behavior of the `date_range` call within the `_get_time_bins` function. By considering the specific case of clock change days in the time zone, we can ensure that the datetime range is correctly generated, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Proposed Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous time correctly:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    offset = to_offset(self.freq)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=offset,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This modification includes using `to_offset(self.freq)` to get the offset for the frequency, which helps in handling ambiguous times appropriately within the `date_range` call.

By making this adjustment, the function should now properly handle the issue described in the GitHub bug report, allowing for correct grouping on clock-change days without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
