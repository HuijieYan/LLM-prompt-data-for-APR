### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper` and is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax`, which should be a `DatetimeIndex`. The function calculates `first` and `last` timestamps using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` helper function and then creates `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges` for the time bins.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight-saving time transitions, specifically when converting timezones (as mentioned in the GitHub issue).

### Bug Cause:
1. The error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from ... as there are no repeated times` occurs when the code tries to generate time bins on November 4th, the day when daylight savings time ends in Cuba. This results in an ambiguous timestamp due to the time zone conversion which the function doesn't handle correctly.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
1. Handle the ambiguous time issue by modifying the creation of the `binner` and `labels` arrays. Since the error arises at midnight on November 4th, adjust the bins to consider both possible representations of this time. Use forward-shift on November 4th to prevent the ambiguity.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use forward shift to handle ambiguous datetimes during DST transitions
    first = first + self.freq
    last = last - self.freq

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After applying this fix, the function should handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly during the DST transition, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
