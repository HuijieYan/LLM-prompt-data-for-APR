### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is responsible for getting the time bins for groupby operations. It expects the input parameter `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`, which must be true for the function to proceed.
2. The bug occurs when handling a situation involving a clock change day in Cuba where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is related to inferring the DST time from a specific timestamp where there are no repeated times, causing the error.
4. The expected output should consist of three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled correctly and contain the data points for that day.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to address how midnight local time is handled on the clock change day and ensure that groupby operations work correctly in such scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Handle the situation where midnight local time is ambiguous on the clock change day in Cuba by adjusting the logic that determines the time bins.
2. Identify the specific issue causing the error regarding the DST time inference and ensure that the labeling and grouping are done correctly.
3. Make necessary adjustments to the code to handle the ambiguous timestamp situation and generate the expected groups without triggering the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        # Adjust labels based on the bins
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the logic to handle the ambiguous timestamp situation on clock change days, the corrected function should now generate the expected groups without causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
