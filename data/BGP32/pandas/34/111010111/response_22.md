### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` expects the input `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`, and then it calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps based on the min and max values of `ax`. The issue arises during the creation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, where an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the handling of daylight saving time changes.
2. The issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes, specifically when converting timestamps from UTC to a timezone like 'America/Havana'.
3. The expected output should be three groups representing each day: 3rd, 4th (comprising 25 hourly data points), and 5th of November. The labels for the groups should reflect the correct times before and after the clock change on the 4th of November.
4. The erroneous behavior results from the incorrect handling of timestamps in the 'America/Havana' time zone, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. To fix this, the `date_range` function should be adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
5. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function handles the ambiguous time correctly by adjusting the behavior specifically for dates with daylight saving time changes.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the daylight saving time ambiguity error:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the behavior of the `date_range` function with the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter, the corrected function should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly during daylight saving time changes, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and providing the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
