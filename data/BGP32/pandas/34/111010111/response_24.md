### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class, which extends the `Grouper` class. The function aims to calculate time bins for groupby operations on a DatetimeIndex.
   
2. The bug seems to originate from the use of the `date_range` function to generate bins and labels. On days where there is a daylight saving time transition like in the given test case for Cuba's time zone, this can lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the incorrect handling of time, specifically around the repeated times during the transition.
   
3. The function tries to generate time bins and labels based on the `first` and `last` timestamps, but as the error message suggests, the call to `date_range` can't handle the ambiguous time during the daylight saving transition. This results in the error being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To correct the bug introduced by the `AmbiguousTimeError`, we need to adjust how the bins and labels are defined. This adjustment should properly handle the ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time transition.
   
2. One approach could be to manually create the bins and labels instead of using the `date_range` function, ensuring that the ambiguous times are dealt with appropriately.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate the bins and labels manually
    all_bins = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(all_bins, ax_values)
    
    # Calculate bins using the generated bins not with date_range
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By manually creating the bins and labels based on the start and end time range, we aim to circumvent the issue of ambiguous times that can arise during daylight saving time transitions as seen in the test case for Cuba's time zone.
