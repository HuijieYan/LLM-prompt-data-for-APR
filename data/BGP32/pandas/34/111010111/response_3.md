### Analyzing the buggy function and related information

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The function expects the input parameter `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`; otherwise, it raises a `TypeError`.
3. The function calculates the `first` and `last` timestamps based on the minimum and maximum values of the `DatetimeIndex` `ax` using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, and then creates `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function.
4. The computation of `binner` and `bin_edges` is done via the `_adjust_bin_edges` method within the `TimeGrouper` class.
5. The function then uses `lib.generate_bins_dt64` to generate bins based on axis values, bin edges, closed setting, and the presence of nans.
6. The issue arises when handling ambiguous timestamps related to daylight saving time changes and results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the test execution.
7. The expected fixed behavior should handle the ambiguous time situation correctly, ensuring that the grouping is done consistently.

### Error Cause and Bug Fix Strategy

The bug is related to handling ambiguous time during daylight saving time changes while grouping by daily frequency. The error occurs because the timestamp adjustment in the `_get_time_bins` function takes place directly without considering the potential ambiguities introduced by the timestamp shifts. To fix this, we need to ensure that ambiguous times are resolved correctly for accurate grouping.

To address this bug:
- We need to handle the ambiguous time scenario by refining how the timestamps are adjusted and labeled.
- It involves ensuring that the handling of timestamps around daylight saving time changes is done in a way that doesn't lead to ambiguous time errors.

### Corrected Function Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function considering the handling of ambiguous timestamps around daylight saving time changes:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of ambiguous timestamps when generating bins and labels. It incorporates adjustments to handle the timezone shifts around daylight saving time changes, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered in the failing test case.
