### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
2. The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax`, which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling daylight saving time transitions incorrectly.
4. The expected input values include a specific list of timestamps representing hourly intervals in the `ax` parameter.
5. The expected output includes generating `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` based on the provided timestamps and frequency information.

### Bug and Cause:
The bug seems to arise due to the fact that the function `date_range` is used in an incorrect way. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to how daylight saving time (DST) transitions are handled. In certain cases, like the example provided in the GitHub issue, there can be ambiguity in the timestamps. The code doesn't properly handle this ambiguity, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle DST transitions correctly by considering the daylight-saving differences in timestamps. One way to address this is to adjust how the `date_range` function is used to accommodate DST transitions. Additionally, proper handling of ambiguous time points like the one presented in the failing test should be considered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust for daylight saving differences
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',  # Handle ambiguity
        nonexistent='shift_forward',  # Adjust for non-existent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if necessary
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to handle daylight saving time transitions appropriately by adjusting the `date_range` call parameters to account for ambiguity and nonexistent times. This adjustment should help in resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and properly generate time bins in the presence of DST transitions.
