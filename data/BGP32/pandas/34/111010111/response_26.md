### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class. It is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` arising from an issue with handling the daylight saving time change in a particular timezone (Cuba in this case) during the grouping operation.
3. The function is supposed to generate `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` based on the input `ax`. The error occurs when trying to apply a frequency that involves ambiguous time transitions.
4. The expected output should be correctly segmented bins for the given input with appropriate labels during the daylight saving time transition.

### Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time transitions during daylight saving time changes. Specifically, the error arises when constructing the time bins and labels which do not account for the ambiguity in the time transition for the mentioned timezone.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time transition appropriately. This involves ensuring that the time bins and labels are correctly adjusted to accommodate the change in daylight saving time.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Update to handle daylight saving time ambiguity
    binner, bins, labels = lib.group_bins_for_time_weighted(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, self.label, has_nans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction uses the `lib.group_bins_for_time_weighted` function to properly handle the time transition ambiguity during daylight saving time changes, ensuring the bins and labels are correctly adjusted. This update should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and provide the expected time grouping behavior.
