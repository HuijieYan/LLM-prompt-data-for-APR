### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to generate time bins for resampling but is failing due to an issue related to daylight saving time (DST) transitions. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` deals with resampling time series data across DST transitions, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Location
The buggy function fails when creating `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`. The error occurs during DST transition causing an ambiguous time which leads to the error when generating the bins for the time series data.

### Bug Explanation
1. The error originates from the DST transition happening at midnight during the resampling process.
2. During the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, the clocks shift forward by one hour. In this shift, there is a repeated hour (after 23:00 standard time, it jumps to 01:00 daylight saving time).
3. The function fails to handle this transition, leading to an ambiguous time error since the same hour appears twice in the generated `labels`.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` exacerbates the issue due to the DST transition at midnight on November 4, 2018.

### Proposed Fix
To fix this issue, you can handle the DST transition explicitly by adjusting the labels and bins accordingly. When dealing with ambiguous times during DST transitions, it is essential to consider the duplicated hour to avoid errors.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function after handling the DST transition explicitly:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate bins considering DST transitions
    dt_range = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
                          ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(dt_range, ax.asi8)

    # Generate bins based on relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Adjust labels and bins during DST transitions
    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = binner
        if self.label == 'right':
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After applying this correction, the function should properly handle DST transitions, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` and passing the failing test case.
