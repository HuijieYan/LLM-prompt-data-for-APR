## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on a `DatetimeIndex` input. The function calls the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function from the same file and `date_range` from the imports to calculate the time bin edges and create the bins.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Getting the first and last timestamp incorrectly.
2. Generating the bins and labels based on the calculated edges.
3. Handling the case when the number of labels is greater than the number of bins.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug might occur due to incorrect handling of the edge timestamps while generating bins and labels. If the timestamp processing is not accurate, it can lead to discrepancies in the bins and labels generated, causing unexpected behavior in downstream processing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation of the first and last timestamps is correct.
2. Verify the generation of bins and labels based on these timestamps.
3. Address the scenario where the number of labels exceeds the number of bins by adjusting the labels accurately.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Avoiding nanosecond part issues while calculating bins
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function has been updated to handle edge cases correctly, ensure accurate calculation of bins and labels, and address issues where labels exceed the bins in number.
