### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is used for time-interval grouping. The function aims to generate time bins based on the provided axis (`ax`). However, there are issues in the calculation of the time bins and labels due to the implicit assumption of the frequency (`self.freq`) being one day.

The problem arises when dealing with Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, as the frequency of one day may not hold during such transitions. This causes mismatched labels and bins, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug
The bug stems from assuming a fixed frequency of one day without considering possible shifts due to DST transitions. This assumption leads to incorrect calculation of bin edges, resulting in mismatched labels and bins.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to account for potential shifts in time frequencies during DST transitions. We should handle this dynamically rather than assuming a fixed frequency, ensuring that the labels and bins align correctly even during DST changes.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = ax.copy()
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first.floor("D"), end=last.ceil("D"), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version dynamically adjusts the bin range based on the minimum and maximum values in the input axis `ax`, considering any potential DST shifts. It ensures that the labels and bins are correctly aligned even in cases of DST transitions.
