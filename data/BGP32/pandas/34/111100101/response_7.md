### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins based on the input `ax` provided that it is a `DatetimeIndex`. The function calculates the first and last timestamp edges, creates bins, and adjusts labels accordingly. However, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of time zones, which results in a mismatch between the labels and the bins.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the time zone conversion applied to the date index `ax` within the function. While the data contains timestamps in different time zones (America/New_York and America/Havana), the conversion leads to misaligned binning and labeling, causing the failure in the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to maintain consistency in time zones throughout the function's operations. It is essential to ensure that the time zone information is accurately preserved during calculations and comparisons to avoid discrepancies between bins and labels.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Ensure consistent time zone handling
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Preserve input time zone
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version explicitly preserves the time zone information throughout the function's calculations to ensure consistent binning and labeling, resolving the bug that caused the test case failure.
