### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on a `DatetimeIndex` input. However, there is an issue in calculating the `last` timestamp while creating the bins, which leads to incorrect ranges.

#### Bug
The bug is in the calculation of the `last` timestamp. The `last` timestamp is calculated based on the `ax.max()` value, which might not be accurate when dealing with time changes such as Daylight Saving Time (DST). This can lead to incorrect binning and mismatch between labels and bins.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to provide a more robust and accurate way of calculating the `last` timestamp that takes into account the potential pitfall of time changes like DST. One way to achieve this is by directly adding the frequency to the `first` timestamp after generating bins. This would ensure that the `last` timestamp is correctly calculated and avoids the DST issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    start = first
    while start < first + self.freq:
        start = start + self.freq
    last = start - self.freq

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix, the function should now calculate the `last` timestamp correctly, avoiding issues related to Daylight Saving Time changes.
