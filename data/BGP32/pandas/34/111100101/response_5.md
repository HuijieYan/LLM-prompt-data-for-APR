### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input datetime index. The issue arises when generating the `labels` variable, which determines the date-time labels for the bins. Due to incorrect slicing logic, the labels do not align properly with the bins, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `labels` variable is being incorrectly sliced based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes. This logic is flawed and results in misaligned labels.
2. When the `self.closed` attribute is set to `"right"`, the labels should be shifted to the right by one compared to the bins. However, the current logic does not handle this properly, leading to incorrect labeling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic responsible for generating the `labels` variable to ensure proper alignment with the bins. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where `self.closed` is set to `"right"` and adjust the labels accordingly.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function addresses the slicing logic for `labels` based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes, ensuring that the labels align correctly with the bins. This fix should pass the failing test case provided.
