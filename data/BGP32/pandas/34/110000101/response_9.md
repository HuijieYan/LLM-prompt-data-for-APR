### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, which is causing issues in generating the correct bins and labels. The timestamp generation uses `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to get the first and last timestamps, but there is an issue in how these timestamps are calculated.

The incorrect calculation leads to the creation of bins and labels that do not align properly with the timestamp range of the input datetime index. This results in incorrect binning and labeling of the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps based on the input datetime index and the specified frequency. By ensuring that these timestamps are correctly calculated, we can generate the appropriate bins and labels for the given datetime index.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)  # Adjusted to floor the min timestamp
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)  # Adjusted to ceil the max timestamp
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function addresses the issue by correctly calculating the `first` and `last` timestamps by flooring the minimum timestamp and ceiling the maximum timestamp to align with the provided frequency. This ensures that the bins and labels are generated correctly based on the input datetime index and frequency.
