### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the way `binner` and `labels` are created and adjusted during the binning process. The issue arises when manipulating the labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters. This bug causes incorrect alignment between the bins and labels, potentially leading to errors such as "Values falls after last bin."

The main issues in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect initialization of `binner` and `labels` without considering the closed parameter correctly.
2. Incorrect adjustment of labels based on the label parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the creation and adjustment of `binner` and `labels` align correctly with the closed and label parameters. This involves correctly setting the start and end dates for binning and adjusting the labels based on the closed and label parameters.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner.copy()
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by adjusting the labels based on the closed and label parameters correctly and ensuring alignment between the bins and labels.
