### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to get the time bins based on the given axis (`ax`) for time-interval grouping. The function seems to have a bug where the labels and binner are not being generated correctly, causing mismatched bins and labels.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be arising from incorrect label and binner generation based on the time range of the axis. Due to improper handling, the labels end up being shorter than the bins, leading to an erroneous state.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the labels and binner are generated appropriately to match the bins. Specifically, we need to adjust the label generation logic based on the frequency and time range of the axis to avoid any mismatches.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version of the function, the labels and bins should be generated correctly based on the time range of the axis, ensuring proper matching and alignment between the generated bins and labels.
