### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas` library.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on a given `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug arises due to handling ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions, particularly in the case of time intervals like daily grouping on days where there is a change in time.
4. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` aims to group hourly data into daily intervals with a timezone change in between, leading to ambiguous timestamps.
5. The bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` while grouping data.
6. The expected return values involve creating appropriate bins and labels for time intervals correctly considering the daylight saving time transition.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to incomplete handling of ambiguous times during time zone transitions, specifically when generating time bins for grouping.
- The algorithm doesn't consider the effect of ambiguous times and doesn't adjust the bins and labels accordingly, leading to errors.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the bin edge calculation to properly handle ambiguous times during timezone transitions.
2. Ensure that the labels and bins are aligned correctly, accounting for changes in time resulting from daylight saving time.
3. Update the logic to address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report about daily frequency grouping on days with time changes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, considering daylight saving time changes
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust the labels if more than bins to align
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test by properly handling ambiguous timestamps during time zone transitions.
