### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module.
2. The function expects an input `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex`, and its purpose is to compute time bins based on the input.
3. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, specifically on clock change days.
4. The expected behavior is to handle ambiguous timestamps and group the data correctly without raising any errors.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with clock change days in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to originate from the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the function, specifically when dealing with daylight saving time transitions.

### Bug Cause:
When encountering ambiguous timestamps like on a clock change day in Cuba, the function fails to handle the AmbiguousTimeError properly, leading to incorrect binning of the data. This results in an inconsistency in the grouping of the data based on the time bins.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensure proper binning of the data. This can be achieved by identifying and addressing the specific issues related to handling ambiguous time transitions on clock change days.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version strengthens the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensures that the binning of data is carried out without errors, specifically on clock change days in regions like Cuba.
