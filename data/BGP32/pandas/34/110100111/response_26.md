### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file.
2. The function expects a `DatetimeIndex` as input for the `ax` parameter. It performs operations like determining the first and last timestamps, creating bins, adjusting labels, and generating bins based on the provided frequency and closed label.
3. The bug is related to timestamp ambiguity on the day of the clock change in Cuba, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test case.
4. The failing test case uses a scenario where the data spans over a clock change day in Havana, leading to ambiguous midnight timestamps that the function fails to handle properly.
5. The expected output should provide three groups representing each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), correctly labeling the groups including the ambiguous midnight timestamp and assigning correct data points.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the function not handling the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day correctly. During the label adjustment and bin generation steps, there are inconsistencies in how the midnight timestamp is processed, leading to discrepancies in the output and consequent test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day correctly. This involves adjusting the labels, bin edges, and bins generation processes to account for the special case of the ambiguous midnight timestamp.

### Correction:
Based on the analysis and issue's details, we can correct the function as follows:

```python
# import necessary modules if not already imported

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction includes handling the ambiguity in the timestamp during the clock change day scenario, ensuring that the labels, bin edges, and generated bins are adjusted correctly to match the intended behavior, as described in the failing test case scenario. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass the failing test case.
