### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which handles grouping for time intervals.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug is likely causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data on the specific day with ambiguity.
4. The issue is due to the incorrect handling of timestamps around the clock change on that specific day.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in calculating the time bins during the transition period.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Implement logic to handle the ambiguous time segment correctly by adjusting the time bins and labels accordingly.
2. Ensure that the time bins and labels correctly represent the days around the clock change without causing any data loss or errors due to ambiguity.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()  # Make a copy to avoid mutating binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should handle the ambiguous time periods correctly during the clock change day in Cuba without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
