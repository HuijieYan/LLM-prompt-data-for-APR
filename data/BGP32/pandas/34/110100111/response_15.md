### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` inside the `TimeGrouper` class is failing in the presence of ambiguous time on the day of a clock change in Cuba.
2. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of ambiguous time shifts during grouping with daily frequency, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The bug is triggered when the function attempts to generate the bins and labels for the daily grouping, particularly around the time of the clock change.
4. The bug's context and symptoms align with the GitHub issue where the expected output is missing grouping for the ambiguity in the day of the clock change.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Address the issue of ambiguous times during the daylight saving time transition within the `_get_time_bins` function by ensuring correct handling of the time shifts.
2. Adjust the bin generation logic to account for ambiguous time slots and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. Verify the behavior with the provided failing test to ensure correct grouping output in the presence of ambiguous times.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor("D")
    last = ax.max().ceil("D")
    bin_edges = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, bin_edges)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, changes have been made to ensure proper handling of ambiguous times during daily grouping, addressing the bug identified.

The corrected function should now correctly handle daily grouping on days where an ambiguous time shift occurs, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
