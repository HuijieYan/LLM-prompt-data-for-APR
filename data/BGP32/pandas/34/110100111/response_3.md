### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `resample.py` file of pandas library.
2. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input ax (DatetimeIndex).
3. The bug reported on GitHub is due to the function not handling ambiguous time correctly during a clock change day in Cuba.
4. The main issue arises from the conversion of `ax` to `binner` and `labels`, where the midnight value is being incorrectly handled.
5. The function needs to handle the ambiguous time correctly to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
6. The fix would involve adjusting the way the `binner` and `labels` are generated, particularly around the ambiguous time near midnight.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous time when generating `binner` and `labels` during a clock change day in Cuba. The function does not consider the ambiguity correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation. This results in incorrect bin edges and labels for the time intervals.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Handle ambiguous times correctly during the generation of `binner` and `labels`.
2. Adjust the processing near midnight to handle the ambiguity appropriately.
3. Ensure that the bin edges and labels align with the expected behavior during the clock change days.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After applying the suggested fix in the corrected function, the ambiguity near midnight on the clock change day in Cuba should be handled correctly, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` and providing the expected output during the groupby operation.
