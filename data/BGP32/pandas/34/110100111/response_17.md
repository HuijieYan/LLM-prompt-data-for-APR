### Analysis
The bug is located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The issue involves handling daylight saving time adjustments and ambiguous timestamps. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the problem where the expected output differs due to ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change.

The function fails to properly handle the time bins and labels when dealing with daylight saving time shifts. This leads to incorrect binning on the day of a clock change where the timestamps are ambiguous.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from how the function processes timestamps on the day of a clock change with daylight saving time. It particularly affects midnight timestamps which are ambiguous due to the clock change. The improper handling of these ambiguous timestamps leads to incorrect bin boundaries and labels, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles the binning and labels on the day of the clock change. Specifically, we should ensure that the timestamps are properly adjusted and the bins and labels align correctly with the expected behavior during daylight saving time adjustments. It is important to consider the timezone information and the ambiguous nature of the timestamps on the day of the clock change.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')  # Floor to get the start of the day
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')  # Ceil to get the end of the day

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by adjusting the start and end timestamps of the bins based on the day of the clock change while considering the timezone information and the ambiguous nature of the timestamps.
