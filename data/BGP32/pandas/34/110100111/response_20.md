## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which inherits from `Grouper` in the `pandas` library.
2. The buggy function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if not.
3. The bug seems to occur due to handling of timestamps around the transition point during daylight saving time changes.
4. The issue posted on GitHub mentions that the `groupby` call raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba, due to midnight local time being an ambiguous timestamp. This aligns with the bug in this function.
5. The expected output should be three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, 5th of November) with proper labeling before and after the clock change on the 4th.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when creating bins and labels for the time interval grouping around clock change days with ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes. The labels and bins are not handled correctly, leading to errors like `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Focus on properly handling the timestamp range around the ambiguous time during daylight saving time transitions.
2. Ensure that the bins and labels are generated correctly considering the ambiguous timestamps.
3. Adjust labels and bins based on the time zone information to account for the transition points.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
        
    first = ax[0].to_period(freq=self.freq)._start_time
    last = ax[-1].to_period(freq=self.freq)._end_time

    if ax.tz is not None:
        first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz)
        last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        name=ax.name,
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(binner) < len(bins):
        labels = labels[: len(binner)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After updating the `_get_time_bins` function with the corrected logic for handling ambiguous timestamps around daylight saving time changes, the function should now correctly create bins and labels while taking into account the time zone information and transition points. This fix should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported on GitHub in scenarios like clock change days in Cuba.
