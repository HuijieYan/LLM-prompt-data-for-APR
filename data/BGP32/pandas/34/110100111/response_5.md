### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, relating to time-interval grouping during a groupby operation.
2. The function seems to handle the creation of time bins for the given `DatetimeIndex` values based on frequency and other parameters.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling time bins and labels around the clock change in Cuba causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
4. The function seems to incorrectly adjust labels and bins leading to incorrect grouping.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug seems to arise due to incorrect label and bin adjustment around ambiguous timestamp transitions during the clock change.
2. The `binner` and `labels` adjustments based on the frequency and label type seem to be incorrect leading to errors.
3. The time labels and bins are not properly aligned causing misinterpretation of data on the clock change day.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper alignment and handling of labels and bins around ambiguous time transitions.
2. Correct adjustment of labels based on the frequency, closed end, and label type.
3. Update the code to handle ambiguous times and time zone transitions correctly.
4. Validate the handling of bins and labels based on the time interval to prevent errors.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels.shift()
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift()

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust labels to match number of bins
    labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

With the corrected function, the labeling of time bins should be handled correctly around ambiguous timestamp transitions, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
