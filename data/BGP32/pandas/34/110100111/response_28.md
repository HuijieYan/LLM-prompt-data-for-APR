## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper`. It expects an input parameter `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex` and performs operations on this input to calculate time bins, labels, and binner.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous time in the input DatetimeIndex.
3. The failing test case demonstrates an issue with `pd.Grouper` on clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The expected output is to have three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) without raising the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the problematic ambiguous time scenario during the creation of the `binner` and `labels` by appropriately adjusting the timestamps based on the frequency and timezone.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `date_range` function call where the start and end timestamps are not handled properly on the clock change day (e.g., November 4th). It fails to consider the ambiguity in the midnight timestamp which leads to the error when grouping data on that particular day.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the start and end timestamps for the date range creation to avoid the ambiguous time issue on clock-change days. We should ensure that the labels and binner are constructed correctly with the appropriate timestamps in the timezone.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.tseries.offsets.Hour(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated version takes into account the ambiguous time issue by adjusting the end timestamp of the date range creation to consider the potential ambiguity on clock-change days. This modification should resolve the issue mentioned in the failing test case.
