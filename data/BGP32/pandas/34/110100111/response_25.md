### Analysis:
1. The `TimeGrouper` class has a `_get_time_bins` function that is meant to handle time-interval grouping but has a bug causing it to fail.
2. The bug appears when dealing with a time change due to a clock change, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of time ranges during the clock change day.
4. The expected behavior is to correctly group the data by day, even on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
5. We need to adjust the time handling logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle clock changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when generating the time bins and labels for the grouped data. Incorrect handling during the clock change day leads to the AmbiguousTimeError.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for creating the time bins and labels to correctly account for the clock change on the day. Specifically, during the clock change, adjust the timestamps accordingly to avoid ambiguity.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.floor('D'),
        end=last.ceil('D'),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts the time range handling to properly handle days with clock changes, avoiding the AmbiguousTimeError when grouping by time intervals.
