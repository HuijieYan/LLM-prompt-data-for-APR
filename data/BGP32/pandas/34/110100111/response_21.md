### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for generating time bins for time-interval grouping.
- The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous time during daylight saving time transitions, specifically on the day of a clock change.
- The function seems to have issues with adjusting bin edges correctly, potentially leading to incorrect labeling and binning of time intervals.
- The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the issue when down-sampling with a frequency of 1 day on a day where daylight saving time changes occur.
- The function fails to properly handle the transition period, leading to incorrect outputs and raising `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the function does not appropriately handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions, especially on days when the clock changes.
- The incorrect adjustment of bin edges and labeling leads to mismatched results and errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic for handling ambiguous times and adjusting bin edges to accommodate daylight saving time transitions effectively.
- Consider using appropriate functions or methods to handle the conversion of timestamps correctly during day light saving time changes.
- Ensure that the bins and labels are adjusted accurately based on the specific time intervals and time zone considerations.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This bug-fixed version adjusts the handling of ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, ensuring correct bin edges adjustments and labeling. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
