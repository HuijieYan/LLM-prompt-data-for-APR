### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class which extends `Grouper`. It is responsible for generating time bins for the given `ax` parameter.
2. The bug seems related to handling ambiguous time due to the clock change in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. The function generates `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` based on the provided `ax` values and other parameters like `freq`, `closed`, and `label`.
4. The `labels` and `binner` could have misaligned indices due to handling of nanosecond parts causing potential issues.
5. The bug causes the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail, impacting the grouping process for the given time range.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is related to the handling of time ambiguities during time binning which leads to misalignment of `binner` and `labels` indices. Particularly, the `replace` method distorts the nanosecond part of `Timestamp` objects causing issues. This results in an incorrect labeling of bins especially during transitions like daylight saving time changes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust how `binner` and `labels` are calculated to ensure consistent indices with accurate labels. To overcome issues with nanosecond precision, direct usage of `first` and `last` Timestamp objects is preferred over using `replace` method. Ensure compatibility with time zone conversions to maintain consistency in time representations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Align labels and adjust for nanosecond part
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the time ambiguity issue and ensure the correct alignment of `binner` and `labels` for accurate time binning, allowing the test case to pass successfully.
