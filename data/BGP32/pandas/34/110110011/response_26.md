### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `resample.py`.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` from `test_datetime_index.py` tries to create a DataFrame and perform a groupby operation, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError due to issues in the `_get_time_bins` function.
3. The error occurs when handling ambiguous times, specifically during transitions like clock change days, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised.
4. The GitHub issue #27787 describes this problem in detail, indicating that `DatetimeIndex` fails when handling such ambiguous times during groupby operations.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises from the handling of ambiguous time during the groupby operation in the `_get_time_bins` function.
- The function does not appropriately handle the ambiguity, leading to errors on clock change days, as seen in the failing test.
- The incorrect processing of time bins and labels based on daylight saving time transitions in Cuba causes the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to address the way time bins and labels are generated in the `_get_time_bins` function. Proper handling of ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions is essential to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Version of `_get_time_bins` Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate time range based on frequency with appropriate handling of ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label != "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version in `resample.py`, the groupby operation on ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, as depicted in the failing test, should now work as expected.
