### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` from `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` during groupby operation due to a bug in the `_get_time_bins` function.
3. The error message points to the issue of not handling ambiguous timestamps during date range generation on clock-change days, specifically on 2018-11-04 in the test case. This causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` as there are no repeated times.
4. The GitHub issue related to this bug describes a similar problem, showing the expectation of getting three groups for each day without facing the `AmbiguousTimeError`, as well as providing the expected output and the versions of packages used.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the function `_get_time_bins` handles ambiguous timestamps during the date range generation for the `TimeGrouper` class. On clock-change days, such as 2018-11-04 in the failing test, the function fails to account for the ambiguity in the timestamps, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the date range generation in the `_get_time_bins` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the date range generation properly handles ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the unique timestamps from the index
    unique_timestamps = ax.drop_duplicates()

    # Generate the date range considering ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=unique_timestamps.min(),
        end=unique_timestamps.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function handling ambiguous timestamps properly during date range generation, the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
