### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class which is a subclass of `Grouper`.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. Then it proceeds to calculate time bins but fails in scenarios where there is an ambiguous time due to daylight savings or other similar issues.
3. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates this bug when trying to group data using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a day with ambiguous time.
4. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when trying to group data due to the presence of non-repeated times, such as during a clock change causing an ambiguous time.
5. The GitHub issue refers to a specific case in Cuba where the bug occurs due to the handling of ambiguous times on clock change days.

### Solution Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, a strategy is needed to handle the ambiguous times correctly. This can involve adjusting the way the time bins are generated or labels are assigned.
2. One approach could be to ensure that the time bins align correctly with the given time range even in the presence of ambiguous times.
3. This may involve using more sophisticated logic to identify and handle ambiguous times appropriately.
4. Taking into account the specificity of the issue in Cuba, adjustments related to timezone conversions and daylight savings transitions may be necessary.

### Fixed Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Directly using first/last without replace() to handle nanosecond part
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the function should handle ambiguous times more effectively, allowing the grouping operation to proceed correctly without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
