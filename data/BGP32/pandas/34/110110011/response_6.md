### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class that extends `Grouper` in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is located in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`.
3. The error message highlights an incompatibility in handling ambiguous time caused by Daylight Saving Time transition in the timezone conversion.
4. The GitHub issue `#23742` was similar but resolved in version 0.24. However, this issue still persists in version 0.24.2.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the use of `date_range` function without considering the ambiguity in time conversions when daylight saving transitions are involved. This causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` as pandas cannot infer the correct time during the transition.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, handle the ambiguous time issue during the conversion from UTC to local time. An ideal solution is to provide a safe conversion method that accounts for the ambiguity during such transitions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version introduces the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter when creating the date range. This parameter informs pandas to infer ambiguous times during the assignment of timezone information.

This fix addresses the issue by ensuring that ambiguous times are appropriately handled during the time binning process. It resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered during the test involving a time zone transition.
