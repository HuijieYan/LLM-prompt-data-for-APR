### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
- The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample data based on a daily frequency, but encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time (DST) transition.
- The failing test error message points out that on a clock change day in Cuba, midnight local time is ambiguous, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- The root cause of the bug lies in handling timestamps during the DST transition when generating date ranges, which leads to the incorrect labeling of bins and subsequently causes the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the conversion of timestamps during the DST transition, where the handling of ambiguous timestamps is not correctly managed.
- The `date_range` generation method does not handle ambiguous timestamps during the clock change, leading to issues in bin labeling and subsequently causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps during the DST transition when generating date ranges.
- Specifically, when creating bins and labels for the time intervals, we need to account for the ambiguity in timestamps that occur during the daylight saving time changes.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the timestamp range considering the DST transitions
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate date range with proper timezone handling and ambiguity resolution
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer"  # Handle ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on timestamps considering the DST transitions
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately during DST transitions, we can resolve the issue and ensure that the down-sampling operation on the DataFrame works correctly without encountering the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
