### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class defined within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is located in `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`.
3. The error message points to an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised when trying to group data on a long clock-change day in Cuba due to handling of midnight timestamps. This error aligns with the GitHub issue `groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba`.
4. The issue is related to how the time bins are calculated when encountering ambiguous timestamps like midnight during daylight saving time transitions.
5. To resolve the bug, adjustments need to be made to handle ambiguous times properly during grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the method of generating time bins using `date_range` and handling ambiguous timestamps incorrectly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the lack of handling of repeated times.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how time bins are calculated to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially during daylight saving time transitions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    bins, mask = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, binner)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts how the bin edges are handled to properly account for ambiguous timestamps and resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue during grouping on days with daylight saving time transitions.
