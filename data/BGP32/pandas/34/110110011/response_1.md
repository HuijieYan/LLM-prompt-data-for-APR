### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class which extends the `Grouper` class.
2. The function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.
3. The bug seems to occur when trying to resample datetime entries during a clock change, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
4. The `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to handling midnight timestamp during the clock change day.
5. The bug causes incorrect labeling and grouping of data during the clock change.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in the timezone, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the creation of bins and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps during the clock change.
2. Explicitly handle midnight timestamp when the clock changes during resampling.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Handle ambiguous time during clock change day
    binner, labels = _adjust_ambiguous(binner, labels, self.closed, self.label, ax)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

def _adjust_ambiguous(binner, labels, closed, label, ax):
    if closed == "left" or (closed == "right" and label == "left"):
        labels = labels.insert(0, ax[0])
    if closed == "right" or (closed == "left" and label == "right"):
        labels = labels.insert(len(labels), ax[-1])
    return binner, labels
```

### Note:
In the corrected function, the `_adjust_ambiguous` function has been added to handle ambiguous timestamps during clock change. It inserts the required timestamps based on the closed end and label types chosen. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` during resampling.
