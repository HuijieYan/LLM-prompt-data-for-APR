### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` calls `groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()`, which eventually tries to execute the `_get_time_bins` function causing the issue.
3. The error message `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` is raised due to ambiguous timestamp handling.
4. The GitHub issue mentions the failure occurring on a clock-change day in Cuba when midnight local time becomes ambiguous.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inability of the current implementation to handle ambiguous times on clock-change days, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This issue affects the generation of bins and labels during the datetime indexing, resulting in incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug and pass the failing test, we need to enhance the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. Specifically, we should improve the handling of ambiguous timestamps during datetime range creation to ensure accurate grouping.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Get the timestamp range with specific time zone handling
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",           # Handle ambiguous times with NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering ambiguous times
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label settings
    labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins due to ambiguous times
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By modifying the handling of ambiguous times and ensuring correct labeling and binning, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test related to the clock-change day ambiguity.
