### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` expects an input parameter `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The buggy function calculates `first` and `last` based on the minimum and maximum timestamps from the input `ax`.
3. The function generates `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` with certain parameters.
4. There is an adjustment of bin edges happening based on the input `ax_values`.
5. The function generates `bins` using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` based on the adjusted bin edges.
6. There are conditionals based on the `closed` and `label` values.
7. The function makes adjustments for handling NaN values in the input data.
8. There is a slice operation to align the number of labels and bins.

The function seems to be failing due to incorrect timestamp calculations around the clock change time in the input data.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the calculation of `last` which uses the maximum timestamp from the input `ax` without considering the potential ambiguity caused by the clock change. This leads to an overlap between the two adjacent days causing the AmbiguousTimeError during the groupby operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of `last` to consider the clock change and potential ambiguity on the day it occurs.
2. Ensure that the label for the bin corresponding to the ambiguous timestamp is correctly handled.
3. Make necessary adjustments in the `binner` and `bins` generation to properly handle the situation around the clock change.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Consider the clock change and potential ambiguity
    last = last.normalize()
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that the `last` timestamp considers the potential ambiguity around the clock change, and the bin generation handles it correctly.
