### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the resampling functionality in pandas.
- The function expects an input `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex` and needs to handle cases where `ax` is empty.
- The main issue arises due to the handling of ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
- The function computes `first` and `last` values based on the minimum and maximum values of the input `ax`.
- It then generates `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`, and adjusts bin edges based on the input `ax_values`.
- Finally, it generates bins based on the adjusted bin edges.

### Bug:
- The main bug arises due to the handling of ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, leading to incorrect binning and label assignment.
- When `ax` includes ambiguous timestamps (e.g., in the Cuba time zone), the labels and bins are not correctly aligned, resulting in errors.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions.
2. Ensure that the bins and labels align correctly, especially when dealing with the transition times.
3. Update the generation of bins to consider ambiguous times correctly.
4. Make sure the labels are adjusted properly based on the binning strategy.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Handle ambiguous times correctly
    # Adjust label assignment based on freq and closed
    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, closed='right', tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    else:
        labels = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(labels, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the handling of ambiguous times and aligning the labels and bins correctly, the corrected function should now work as expected and pass the failing test case.
