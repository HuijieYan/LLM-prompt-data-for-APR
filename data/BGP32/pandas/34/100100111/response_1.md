### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to handle time bins for resampling in pandas.
2. The function checks if the axis `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, raises a `TypeError` if not.
3. It then proceeds to calculate `first` and `last` values for the time range based on the `ax` values.
4. The function constructs `binner` and `labels` `DatetimeIndex` objects based on the time range.
5. Further adjustments are made based on the frequency, labels, and if the axis contains `NaN` values.
6. Finally, the bins are generated using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` and the labels are adjusted if needed based on the count.
7. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post relates to handling ambiguous timestamps related to daylight saving time changes.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Construction of `binner` and `labels` based on `date_range` may lead to issues related to daylight saving time changes.
2. Handling of labels based on the `closed` and `label` parameters might need to be reexamined.
3. Adjustment of bins in case of unequal lengths of `labels` and `bins` may raise issues.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug may arise due to improper handling of ambiguous time zones like those affected by daylight saving time changes, leading to unexpected errors in the resampling process.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Utilize additional arguments or methods to handle ambiguous time zones effectively during the resampling process.
2. Ensure that the labels and bins are aligned properly considering the characteristics of the time range data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function aims to address the issues related to ambiguous time zones and ensure proper alignment of labels and bins during the resampling process.
