### Analysis:
1. The `_get_time_bins` function checks if the `ax` input is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises an error if it's not.
2. It then proceeds to calculate `first` and `last` timestamps using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
3. The `binner` and `labels` are created using the `date_range` function based on the frequency, start, end, and time zone of `ax`.
4. The `bin_edges` are adjusted based on the `ax_values` and `binner`.
5. The function generates `bins` based on the adjusted values and some conditions involving `closed` and `label`.
6. Finally, additional handling is present for cases where `ax` has missing values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating `first` and `last` timestamps.
2. Creating `binner` and `labels`.
3. Adjusting `bin_edges`.
4. Generating `bins`.
5. Handling more `labels` than `bins`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could arise in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` timestamps when there is an ambiguous time zone change due to daylight saving time. This issue is likely to manifest when handling dates that include ambiguous timestamps.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` to account for ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time.
2. Ensure that the timestamps align correctly with the time zone changes.
3. Handle situations where ambiguities might arise during the time range calculation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate 'first' and 'last' without using replace() to handle nanoseconds
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times due to daylight saving change
    tz_ambiguous = (ax.is_dst - ax.is_dst.shift(1)).astype(bool)
    if any(tz_ambiguous):
        last = last - Day()  # Adjust 'last' by subtracting a day to align with daylight saving time

    # Create 'binner' and 'labels' based on adjusted timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate 'bins' based on updated data
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust 'labels' based on 'closed' condition if needed
    labels = binner[1:] if self.closed == "right" else binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Handle missing values in 'ax'
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Align 'labels' with 'bins' if their lengths don't match
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test associated with the bug.
