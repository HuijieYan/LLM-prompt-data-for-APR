### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for calculating time bins based on a DatetimeIndex provided as input. The issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to errors in the grouping process, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps.
2. Adjustment of bin boundaries with `_adjust_bin_edges`.
3. Generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
4. Handling of label adjustments based on `closed` and `label`.
5. Inserting `NaT` values if there are NaN entries in the input DatetimeIndex.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by how the function handles time bins on clock change days, specifically ambiguous timestamps. The use of `tz` information and adjustment procedures in the function fail to account for these cases, leading to errors in bin generation and labeling.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. It involves adjusting the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps, ensuring correct bin boundaries, and handling label adjustments appropriately. Careful consideration of the timezone information and bin generation is crucial for accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly and ensure accurate bin generation, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
