### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` checks if the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to manipulate the timestamp values. 
   
2. The issue on GitHub describes a problem related to time groups on a clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous. This issue seems to be caused by the handling of timestamps by the `groupby` function in such scenarios.

3. The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a datetime range with hourly frequency and performs a grouping operation based on daily frequency. The expected output is to have three groups (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) with specific labels and data points.

4. The current implementation might cause errors related to handling timestamps on clock-change days, leading to incorrect grouping results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the timestamp manipulation does not lead to issues with ambiguous time on clock-change days.
2. Adjust the labels and bins calculation to correctly handle timestamp ranges on such days.
3. Verify that the labels and bins produced align with the expected grouping behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Align labels and bins based on the length of bins
    # to handle potential mismatch as described in the GitHub issue
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version includes adjustments to handle timestamp manipulation on clock-change days and ensures proper alignment between labels and bins based on their lengths. This fix aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to `groupby` behavior in ambiguous time scenarios.
