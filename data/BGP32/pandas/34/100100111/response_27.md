### Analysis:
#### Issue:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle the specific case of an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change in Cuba. This issue is related to the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` which expects the grouping to correctly handle the ambiguous time event.

#### Bug Location:
The bug seems to arise from the incorrect handling of timestamps close to a clock change, specifically the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

#### Bug Cause:
1. The function is not considering the possibility of an ambiguous time due to a clock change.
2. The function is not adjusting for the correct bin edges around the ambiguous timestamp.
3. Lack of proper handling of labels when there are more labels than bins.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the timestamps around the ambiguous time are correctly accounted for in the binning process.
2. Adjust the bin edges to cover both sides of the ambiguous timestamp.
3. Handle the scenario where there are more labels than bins appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust for potential ambiguous time due to clock change
    first = first.tz_localize(None)
    last = last.tz_localize(None)
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=None,  # drop timezone for accurate comparison near ambiguous time
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Handle the case where there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected function should now properly handle the case of an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
