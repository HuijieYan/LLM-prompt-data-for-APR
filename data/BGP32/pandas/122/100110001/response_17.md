### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames based on their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column values and expects them to be unequal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning True instead of False, causing the assertion error.

### Error Location:
The issue is likely in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. Since the DataFrames created in the failing test have different column values, sorting the blocks by type name and locations might not capture the actual differences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on type name and locations, which does not properly account for the content differences between the DataFrames.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to directly compare the values in corresponding blocks rather than relying on sorting by type name and locations. This way, we can accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, the corrected version of the `equals` function should correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames in the given test scenario.
