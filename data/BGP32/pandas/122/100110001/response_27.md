## Analysis:
The `equals` method is supposed to compare two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) for equality by checking the equality of their axes (indexes in columns) and blocks (data). The error specifically occurs when comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

## Bug Identification:
The bug originates from the way the function is structuring the comparison between DataFrames. It is currently comparing them by sorting the blocks based on data type and location, leading to a false positive in the comparison process.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect comparison strategy implemented with the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method, where the sorting order of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs can lead to erroneous results when the content is different.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revamp the way equality between DataFrames is determined, ensuring a more accurate comparison of the content rather than just sorting blocks based on dtype and location. This could involve comparing values directly or taking another approach based on the structure of DataFrames.

## Bug-fixed Function Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_data = self.to_numpy().flatten()  # Convert DataFrame to numpy array and flatten
    other_data = other.to_numpy().flatten()  # Convert DataFrame to numpy array and flatten

    return all(d1 == d2 for d1, d2 in zip(self_data, other_data))
```

By directly comparing the flattened two-dimensional arrays of the DataFrames, we ensure a proper and accurate comparison of their content which fixes the bug.
