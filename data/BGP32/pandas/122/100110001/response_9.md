### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is not comparing the DataFrames correctly. The function checks if the lengths of the axes and blocks match but then proceeds to sort and compare the blocks based on their data type names and manager locations, which is incorrect for comparing two DataFrames.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `equals` function's approach to comparing DataFrames. It sorts the blocks based on data type names and manager locations, which is not a correct way to determine DataFrame equality.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames directly rather than sorting and comparing the blocks. Instead of sorting the blocks, we should compare the values in the DataFrames directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return False

    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False

    if not self.dtypes.equals(other.dtypes):
        return False

    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

By comparing the shape, columns, data types, and values directly, we ensure that the DataFrames are compared correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
