### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two objects `self` and `other` of the same class based on their axes, blocks, and content.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and checks if they are not equal. 
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because the comparison resulted in `True` rather than `False`.
4. The bug might be due to the incorrect sorting or comparison logic within the `equals` function, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function compares the `self` and `other` objects in a way that correctly identifies differences.
2. Update the logic for comparing the blocks so that it correctly handles the provided test case where column order is different.
3. Make sure that the sorting and comparison strategy is robust to handle different block types and content configurations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_dict(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both `dtypes` and `values` for sorting blocks, the corrected function should be able to correctly compare DataFrames that have the same data but in different column orders. This change should address the failing test case provided.
