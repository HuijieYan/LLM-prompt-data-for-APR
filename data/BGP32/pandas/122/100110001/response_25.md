### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is defined within the pandas `IntBlock` class. The function is responsible for checking the equality of two `IntBlock` objects. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that calling the `equals` method on the first DataFrame with the second DataFrame should return `False`. However, due to a bug in the implementation of the `equals` method, the assertion fails.

### Bug in the Function:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the canonicalize function. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on the block's `dtype.name` and its `mgr_locs`. The sorting operation on `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might cause misalignment between the blocks in different positions.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the sorting is not affecting the alignment of the blocks while comparing them.
- A potential fix is to directly compare blocks without sorting since the DataFrame order is already maintained during the creation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and directly comparing the blocks, the corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
