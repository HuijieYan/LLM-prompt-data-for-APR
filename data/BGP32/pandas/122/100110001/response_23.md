The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` to fail with an AssertionError. The function is intended to compare two DataFrames for equality, but it is incorrectly implemented.

By examining the error message, we can see that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because `True is False`. This means that the `equals` method of DataFrames is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the given input DataFrames. This is due to an issue in the `equals` method implementation.

The potential error location in the buggy function is likely in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks using a canonicalize function that combines the type name and manager locations. If the blocks are not correctly sorted or compared, it may lead to incorrect equality comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks of the DataFrames. One way to approach this is to ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are done accurately. Additionally, the comparison logic within the function should be reviewed to guarantee that it accurately determines the equality of the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks in the DataFrames directly
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other.blocks:
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block in the DataFrames and check if it exists in the other DataFrame. If any block is missing or different between the DataFrames, we return `False`. Otherwise, if all blocks match, we return `True`.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately determine the equality of DataFrames, and the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass without any errors or assertions.
