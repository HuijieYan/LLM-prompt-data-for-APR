### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is used to compare two pandas objects for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values to test the equality check.
3. The error message indicates that the equality check is failing when it should return `False`.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug:
The bug is likely due to the comparison logic not handling scenarios where the values are different between the two DataFrames.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality check properly compares all aspects of the DataFrames.
In this case, we can modify the canonicalize function in the `equals` method to handle cases where the blocks are different in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, type(other.blocks[0])):  # Check block type
            return (block.values.tolist(), block.index.tolist())
        return (type(block), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the canonicalize function to properly handle different block values and types, we can ensure that the two DataFrames are compared correctly for equality.
