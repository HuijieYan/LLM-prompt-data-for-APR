Based on the error message provided, the failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, expecting them to be not equal. However, the comparison results in an unexpected `True` value instead of `False`. This discrepancy is caused by the buggy implementation of the `equals` method in the Pandas library.

The buggy function has several potential error locations:
1. The `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls may alter the internal state of the DataFrames `self` and `other`, potentially impacting the comparison later.
2. The sorting of blocks based on "dtype.name" and "mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()" may not result in a reliable order for comparison.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the calls to `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` as they can modify the original DataFrames.
2. Sort the blocks using a more stable and predictable criterion to ensure consistency in the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version avoids modifying the original DataFrames and uses a more suitable method to sort and compare the blocks, ensuring that the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass as expected.
