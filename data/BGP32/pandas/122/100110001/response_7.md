### Analysis:
- The `equals` function from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is buggy and causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` to fail.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it evaluates to `True is False`, which is not correct.

### Identifying the Bug:
- The bug lies in the `equals` function's logic where it is comparing two DataFrames column-wise instead of element-wise.
- The comparison of two DataFrames should be based on the elements in the DataFrame and not on the column names.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method which checks for column equality only, resulting in the failure of the test.
- DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have the same columns, but the values within those columns are not the same, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames' elements directly instead of comparing column names only.
- This can be achieved by comparing the values in the DataFrames element-wise.
- We can create a helper function to compare DataFrames element-wise and return `True` if all elements match or `False` if any element does not match.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.values.shape != other.values.shape:  # Check if shapes are equal
        return False
    return (self.values == other.values).all()  # Element-wise comparison
```

### After applying the fixed version provided above, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass without any errors.
