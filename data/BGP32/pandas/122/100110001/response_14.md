### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method defined in a class within `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method compares two objects and checks if they are equal based on certain criteria.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The test creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they should not be equal when compared using the `equals` method.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error where `assert True is False`, meaning that the bug in the `equals` method causes it to incorrectly return `True` when expected to be `False`. The error message also shows mismatched DataFrame representations that are supposed to be equal based on the buggy logic.
4. The bug is likely related to how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare blocks within the DataFrames. If the sorting does not match the expected order of elements correctly, the comparison could yield incorrect results.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting and comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function is correct and consistent to accurately determine equality between the DataFrames.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use the `type` and binary representation of the block's `mgr_locs` instead of `dtype.name`, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now correctly sort and compare the blocks of DataFrames, ensuring accurate equality checks.
