### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `managers.py` is comparing two data structures by checking whether they are equal or not.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns "a" and "b" and asserts that they are not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and it tries to compare the two DataFrames which are not equal.
4. The bug is with how the `equals` function is implemented; it does not handle the case where two DataFrames with different column values are considered equal.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
Since the current implementation of the `equals` function does not consider the values within the DataFrames, a fix is needed to compare the actual data values in the DataFrames to determine equality. We can modify the `equals` function to compare the columns and values for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if (self.values == other.values).all() and self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. The corrected version compares the actual data values using `self.values` and `other.values`. If all values are the same and the column names match (using `equals` method for columns), the DataFrames are considered equal.
2. If the values or columns are not equal, it returns `False`.

By making these changes, the corrected function will correctly compare the data in the DataFrames for equality, thereby passing the failing test case.
