### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the buggy code is supposed to compare two `DataFrame` objects for equality. However, the bug arises from how the function is comparing the data blocks of the `DataFrame`. It sorts the blocks based on a custom ordering using the `canonicalize` function, but the issue lies in how the blocks are then compared.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with different data for the columns `'a'` and `'b`. The test then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating the `DataFrame` objects are not equal. However, due to the buggy implementation of the `equals` method, when comparing the blocks of data within the `DataFrame`, it follows a custom ordering mechanism that leads to comparing blocks incorrectly.

In the failing test error message, we can see that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing. This happens because the buggy implementation of `equals` leads to the function returning `True` when it should have been `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to be restructured so that the unequal data in the columns `'a'` and `'b'` of the two `DataFrames` are correctly identified, and the function returns `False` as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Correcting the comparison of blocks
    return len(self_blocks) == len(other_blocks) and all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the comparison of the data blocks within the `equals` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
