### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` package is used to compare two objects.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file compares two DataFrames and asserts that they are not equal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because the actual value returned by `df1.equals(df2)` is `True`.
4. The bug is likely due to comparing DataFrames with different column values in a different order, causing them to appear equal when they are not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mismatch in the column values and their order between `df1` and `df2`, leading to the `equals` function returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to identify a more robust way to compare DataFrames in the `equals` function. One approach is to sort the DataFrame columns before comparing them to ensure that the order of columns does not affect the comparison result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, sort DataFrame columns for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.columns.to_list(), block.dtypes.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` function should now compare DataFrames by sorting their columns and their data types before checking for equality, ensuring a more accurate comparison. This fix should make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
