### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the pandas module `managers.py` is the `equals` method.
2. The failing test in the test file `test_internals.py` is testing the equality of two DataFrames using `df1.equals(df2)`.
3. The failing test shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with the error message indicating that `True is False`, meaning the DataFrames are considered equal when they should not be.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the `equals` method causing it to incorrectly determine the equality of the DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `equals` method is using the `equals` method of individual blocks within the DataFrames to compare them. This approach is incorrect because it does not capture the relationship between columns and values in the DataFrames.
- The implementation of `equals` should directly compare the DataFrames as a whole, rather than comparing individual blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `equals` method to compare the DataFrames as a whole by checking column values and index alignment.
- Implement logic that compares each cell in the DataFrames to ensure all values are the same and in the same order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    
    return self.values == other.values
```

By directly comparing the index, columns, and values of the DataFrames, the corrected function should now correctly determine the equality of DataFrames.
