### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test is the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with the comparison between `True` and `False`. It shows that the `equals` method did not return `False` as expected.
4. The bug in the `equals` method might come from the sorting operation on blocks. Since the data in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are different in terms of data types, the sorting operation might not be applying correctly.
5. To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle sorting based on actual values rather than data types, which should lead to correct comparison for the `equals` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort based on values rather than data types, the corrected version should fix the bug and make the `equals` method behave as expected, passing the failing test.
