### Error in Analyzing the Buggy Function
1. The `equals` function in the buggy code snippet is attempting to compare two internal structures (`self` and `other`). 
2. It checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, but fails if there's a mismatch without considering the data within the structures.
3. The root cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison logic based solely on the sizes of axes and blocks, leading to the test failing due to a false assertion (True is not False).
4. To fix this issue, we need to compare the actual data within the `self` and `other` structures rather than just comparing lengths of axes and blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. We need to modify the `equals` function to compare the data of `self` and `other` instead of just comparing the structures' sizes.
2. We will iterate over the data within `self` and `other` to check for equality.
3. This modification will allow the function to correctly identify if the data in the structures being compared is equal or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    if self.shape[0] != other.shape[0] or self.shape[1] != other.shape[1]:
        return False

    for i in range(self.shape[0]):
        for j in range(self.shape[1]):
            if not self.blocks[i][j].values.equals(other.blocks[i][j].values):
                return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if `other` is an instance of a `BlockManager` to ensure compatibility.
- Next, we check if the shapes of the two structures (`self` and `other`) match. If not, we return False immediately.
- Then we iterate over all the blocks in the two structures to compare the actual data within the blocks. If any data values within the blocks are not equal, we return False.
- If all data comparisons pass, we return True to indicate that the structures are equal.

This corrected function should address the issue and pass the failing test.
