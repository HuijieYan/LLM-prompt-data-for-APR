1. The buggy function "equals" in the "managers.py" file is meant to compare the equality of two data structures. It compares two objects based on their axes, blocks, and individual elements. The test function "test_dataframe_not_equal" creates two DataFrames with different values in the columns "a" and "b" to check if the "equals" function correctly identifies them as not equal.

2. One potential error location within the "equals" function is the sorting of blocks using a custom key. This sorting might be causing the mismatch in the comparison of DataFrames.

3. The bug occurs because the buggy "equals" function is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different values in the columns properly. The custom sorting based on the block's data type name and the manager's locations can lead to incorrect results when the DataFrames have columns with different values.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to check for equality based on the content of the DataFrames rather than sorting the blocks using a custom key. We can compare the values directly to check for equality.

5. Here is the corrected version of the "equals" function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return self._mgr.equals(other._mgr)
```
In the corrected version, we remove the sorting of blocks and directly compare the internal data representations of the DataFrames using the internal "_mgr" attribute which represents the data structure of the DataFrame content.

This corrected version should pass the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" by correctly identifying DataFrames with different column values as not equal.
