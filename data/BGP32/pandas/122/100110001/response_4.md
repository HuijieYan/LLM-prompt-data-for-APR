### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is failing in the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file due to an incorrect implementation of comparing two DataFrames.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the way the function compares two DataFrames. It uses `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to compare the blocks of data within the DataFrames. However, in the given failing test, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have different values for columns 'a' and 'b'.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy implementation of the `equals` function compares the DataFrames based on block order and dtype, but it fails to correctly compare the actual values within the DataFrames. Therefore, the test fails as it expects the DataFrames with different values to be considered unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug and make the `equals` function correctly compare DataFrames based on their values, we need to update the comparison logic within the function to compare the actual values in the DataFrames rather than just their blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

By directly comparing the values of the DataFrames using the `equals` method available for DataFrame values, we ensure that the DataFrames are considered equal only when they have the same values, which aligns with the expectations of the failing test.

After making this correction in the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully, as the corrected implementation properly compares the actual values of the DataFrames.
