The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it compares DataFrames. The function should compare DataFrames element-wise, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to the failing test case.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic inside the `equals` function that compares blocks for equality could be flawed.
2. The handling of DataFrames and their columns within the function may not be correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with the same column names but different values in those columns. The bug in the `equals` method causes it to return True incorrectly, indicating that the two DataFrames are equal, which is incorrect. This results in the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the DataFrames `self` and `other` element-wise, ensuring that the values in corresponding positions are checked for equality. This can be achieved by properly iterating over the blocks of the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare DataFrames element-wise
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

After fixing the function as shown above, it should correctly compare the DataFrames and return the proper equality result.

By updating the `equals` function with the corrected logic for comparing DataFrames element-wise, the bug causing the failing test has been addressed. The corrected function should now pass the failing test without any assertion errors.
