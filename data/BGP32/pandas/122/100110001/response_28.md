### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file is attempting to compare two DataFrames by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The buggy function sorts the blocks and then compares them, but the function is not handling the case where the DataFrame columns are in different order.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Issue with sorting the blocks in `canonicalize` function.
2. Inadequate handling of DataFrame column order difference.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in its current state does not account for differences in column order between the two DataFrames. The two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have different column orders, resulting in a false assertion when comparing them using the buggy `equals` function. The error message emphasizes that it expected `True` and received `False`, exposing the incorrect handling of column order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the DataFrames taking into account the column order as well. The function should first check the equality of columns between the two DataFrames before proceeding with comparing the blocks. To achieve this, we can sort the columns before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = self.blocks.sort_index(axis=1)
    other_blocks_sorted = other.blocks.sort_index(axis=1)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks_sorted, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks_sorted, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the columns of the DataFrames (`self.blocks` and `other.blocks`) before comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, we can ensure that the comparison takes into account the column order. This corrected version should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
