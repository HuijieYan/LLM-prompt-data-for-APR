1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The test that is failing is `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the logic for comparing the blocks of the dataframes `df1` and `df2`.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function compares the blocks of the dataframes. It is expected that the function should return `False` when the dataframes are not equal. However, the `equals` method implementation has some issues that are causing the comparison to fail and return `True` instead of `False`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks in the dataframes is done correctly. This may involve revising the logic used to compare the blocks or modifying the condition under which the function returns `False`.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the data blocks between the dataframes
    for i, (self_block, other_block) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks of both dataframes and comparing them individually, we ensure a more accurate comparison of the dataframes. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
