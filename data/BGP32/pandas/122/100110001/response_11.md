### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `DataFrame` objects to check their equality. The issue lies in the comparison logic that should confirm the equality based on the values in the `DataFrame` objects. The bug arises from the fact that it does not correctly handle the comparison of different data types in the columns of the DataFrames.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` uses two `DataFrame` objects with columns having different data types compared to each other. Since the buggy `equals` function is not handling this scenario properly, it incorrectly returns `True` for the equality check, leading to test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the values in columns even if they have different data types. The fix should ensure that the comparison considers the actual values in the DataFrames rather than just the data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) # Get values for proper comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison will consider the actual values in the DataFrames instead of just the data types. Now, the corrected function should ensure that the DataFrames are equal only if their values match, resolving the bug and making the failing test pass.
