### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is used to check the equality of two objects based on their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in their columns `a` and `b`, then asserts that the `equals` method should return `False`, which is correct. However, the buggy implementation fails this test and always returns `True`. This discrepancy causes the failing test.

### Bug
The bug stems from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks and then compares them using the `equals` method. Since the DataFrame blocks have different values in this case, the blocks are not equal even if sorted. This leads to the incorrect result when comparing two DataFrames.

### Fix
A potential fix for this issue is to first check if the lengths of the DataFrames are the same. If not, return `False` immediately. Then, iterate over the column names and compare the values from each DataFrame. This will give a correct comparison result instead of relying on block sorting.

### Corrected Version of the equals Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check if the length and columns are the same
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns) or self.columns.tolist() != other.columns.tolist():
        return False
    
    # Check equality of values in DataFrame
    return self.values.tolist() == other.values.tolist()
```

The corrected version compares the lengths of axes and columns first, then directly compares the values of the DataFrames, ensuring a correct equality check. This fix should make the test pass successfully.
