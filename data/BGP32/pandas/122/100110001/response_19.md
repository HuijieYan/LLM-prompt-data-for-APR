### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is failing for the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with columns in different orders. The function is not handling this case correctly and asserting that the DataFrames are equal. The error message shows that the assertion fails on `True is False`, indicating that the buggy function is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Issue:
The issue lies in how the function `equals` handles the comparison of DataFrames. It does a column-wise comparison without considering the order of columns. So, even if the columns are in different orders, it wrongly considers the DataFrames as equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for the order of columns as well. We can compare column names and values while considering column order in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns) or not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False

    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first check for column equality based on their names and order.
2. Then, we compare the values of each column to ensure that the DataFrames are equal.

This updated logic will correctly handle the case where columns are in different orders in the DataFrames.
