### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This method is intended to compare two objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` which are intentionally made different to test the equality check.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` method is related to the way it performs the comparison between the two dataframes. Dataframes are being compared row-wise, but the indices are not aligned correctly resulting in the false assertion that the two dataframes are equal, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to compare the data in a structured manner. Since the error message indicates that the dataframes are being compared as if they were instances of a class (`<bound method NDFrame.equals>`), the issue may lie within how the data is being processed. We need to ensure that the comparison is done correctly and that the data from each dataframe is aligned properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if all blocks are equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

After making this correction, re-running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should result in a successful assertion.
