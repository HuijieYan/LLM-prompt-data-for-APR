### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is supposed to compare two objects and determine if they are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` constructs two dataframes with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and expects them to be unequal.
- The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function is not working as expected.
- The function is currently comparing the blocks within the objects, which does not align with the test's intention of comparing the dataframes as a whole.

### Issues:
1. The `equals` function is comparing blocks within the objects instead of comparing objects as a whole.
2. The sorting of blocks based on different properties might lead to incorrect comparisons.
3. The function is not considering the values in the dataframes for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the dataframes as a whole. This comparison should be based on the values present in the dataframes rather than individual blocks. Additionally, we should ensure that the order of columns and rows in the dataframes is accounted for during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the index, columns, and individual column values to determine the equality of the dataframes. This approach aligns with the test's expectation of comparing dataframes as a whole based on their content.

The corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
