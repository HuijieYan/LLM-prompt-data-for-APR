## Analysis
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks attributes. The function first checks if the number of axes is the same for both objects and then compares each axis. It then consolidates the internal structures of both objects and compares the blocks.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation lies in the way the `canonicalize` function is defined and used within the function. The `canonicalize` function tries to create a unique representation of each block for comparison purposes. However, there is an issue in the `return` statement of the `canonicalize` function where `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is used. This causes an AttributeError because `as_array` is not a valid method or attribute of `mgr_locs`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to generate a proper representation of the block. We can achieve this by using the `mgr_locs` attribute directly without trying to call invalid methods on it.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now simply returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to compare the blocks correctly.
