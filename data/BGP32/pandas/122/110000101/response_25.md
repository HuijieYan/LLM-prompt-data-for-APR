The bug in the `equals` function is due to the use of `block.dtype.name` in the `canonicalize` function. The `block.dtype.name` retrieves the string representation of the dtype, but in the buggy code, it is used to sort the blocks. Different dtypes can have the same name representation (e.g., `int64` and `float64` both have the same name `'int64'`), causing incorrect sorting and equality checks.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype as a tuple element for sorting. This way, we can accurately compare the blocks based on both dtype and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining dtype,
    # mgr_locs for accurate sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a tuple that includes both the dtype and location, thereby accurately comparing them for equality.
