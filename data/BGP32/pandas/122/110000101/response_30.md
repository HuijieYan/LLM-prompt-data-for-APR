The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and underlying data are equal.

**Bug:**
The bug is likely due to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before comparison. The function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and memory locations. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly inside the `canonicalize` function.

**Fix strategy:**
To fix the bug, we need to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object inside the `canonicalize` function.

**Corrected version:**

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice(0))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug by correctly accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object inside the `canonicalize` function.
