The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs when trying to consolidate and compare the blocks in the two instances.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by considering the block's properties. We should compare the block's `dtype` and `mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are compared based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, which should correctly handle the comparison between two instances of the `BlockManager` class as described in the provided test case.
