### Buggy Function Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The function checks if the lengths of the axes are equal and then iterates over the axes to check if each axis is equal.
- After that, it consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other` instances and checks if the number of blocks is equal.
- It then sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function and compares each block for equality.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the current implementation seems to be in the canonicalization function `canonicalize(block)` where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not properly accessed or converted, causing an error in sorting the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object is accessed correctly to get the array representation for sorting.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly use the type name and array representation to canonicalize the blocks for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correctly accessing the `mgr_locs.as_array.to_list()` and converting the type name to a string, the blocks can now be properly canonicalized and sorted for comparison, resolving the bug in the `equals` function.
