## Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class. It compares the `axes` and `blocks` attributes of both instances to determine equality. In the buggy code, the comparison of blocks is not taking into account the block data itself, only the block order and the block type.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares the blocks based on their order and type but doesn't compare the actual data within the blocks. This can lead to false negatives where two `BlockManager` instances with identical data are considered unequal due to different block order or types.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to also compare the actual data within the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing each element in the blocks to ensure their equality. Additionally, we should ensure that the block data itself is being compared, not just the order and type.

## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added the `block.values` to the `canonicalize` function to include the block data in the comparison. This modification ensures that the `equals` function now compares not only the block order and type but also the actual data within the blocks. This change should fix the bug and make the comparison more robust.
