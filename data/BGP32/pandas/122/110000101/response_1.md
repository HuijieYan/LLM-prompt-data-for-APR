### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It checks if the axes are equal, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks based on a key function `canonicalize`, and then compares the blocks for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function. In the `canonicalize` function, `block.dtype.name` is used to get the dtype name of a block. However, `block.dtype` does not have a `name` attribute. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `name`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the type name of the block. We can use `type(block).__name__` to get the class name of the block. This will ensure that the comparison key is correctly generated for sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
