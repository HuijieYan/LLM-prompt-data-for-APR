The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, there is a bug in the sorting logic when comparing blocks.

The bug occurs when trying to sort the blocks by `canonicalize` function, where the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs` is being accessed incorrectly. The correct attribute to access should be `locs`, not `as_array`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs.locs.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction should ensure that the `equals` function sorts the blocks correctly before comparing them, addressing the bug identified.
