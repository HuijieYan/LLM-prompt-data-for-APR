#### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks in `self` and `other` without considering the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function only considers the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. However, when comparing blocks for equality, we also need to consider the `mgr_locs`.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks are correctly compared based on both `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks are compared correctly based on both `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.
