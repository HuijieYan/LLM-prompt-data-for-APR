### Analysis
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes, blocks, and block locations of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. However, there is a bug in the function where it fails to handle the comparison of block locations correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function that is used to create a key for sorting the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. The issue is with the use of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is converting the `mgr_locs` to a list, but it should compare the array directly without converting it to a list. This conversion to a list causes the comparison to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the `mgr_locs.as_array` directly without converting it to a list. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on their data type and manager locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `canonicalize` function to directly return `mgr_locs.as_array` without converting it to a list. This should fix the bug in the comparison logic and ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on their data type and manager locations.
