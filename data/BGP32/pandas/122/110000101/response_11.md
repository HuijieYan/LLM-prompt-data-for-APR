### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` class. The function is trying to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which might not be the correct way to ensure equality. To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks directly based on their values instead of sorting them. 

### Corrected version of the equals function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we directly compare the `values` attribute of each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` instead of sorting them based on dtype names and manager locations. This ensures that the equality check is based on the actual data content of the blocks.
