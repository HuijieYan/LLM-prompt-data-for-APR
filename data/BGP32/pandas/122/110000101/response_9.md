## Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, there are potential issues in the current implementation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but the comparison of blocks should be based on the block values instead.
2. The comparison of blocks should take into account the dtype and values of the blocks instead of just equality.

## Bug Explanation
The current implementation of the `equals` function does not correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The sorting of blocks based on type and `mgr_locs` does not ensure the correct comparison of blocks. Additionally, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method is not sufficient as it does not consider the actual block values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to:
1. Sort the blocks based on a unique identifier that considers the block values.
2. Compare the block values within the sorted blocks to ensure equality.

## Corrected Version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and (block.dtype == oblock.dtype)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function properly sorts the blocks based on their values and dtype before comparing them for equality. It ensures a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
