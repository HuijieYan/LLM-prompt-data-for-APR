## Explanation of the bug

The buggy function `equals` is comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, then it consolidates the blocks of each instance and compares them. However, there is a bug in the sorting of the blocks. The sorting key `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object. This leads to incorrect comparison of blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. We should convert the `mgr_locs` to a list using the `as_array` attribute before sorting the blocks.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now properly compare the blocks while handling the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly.
