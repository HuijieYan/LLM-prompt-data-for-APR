### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering their contents.
2. Using the `equals` method within a list comprehension without a proper check for each element.
3. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without first ensuring they are consolidated.
4. Comparing the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without checking their contents.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, it fails to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparison. This can lead to incorrect comparisons if the blocks are not sorted in the same order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances have their blocks consolidated before comparison.
2. Update the logic for comparing the axes to properly handle comparison of contents.
3. Implement a stable sorting mechanism for blocks based on type and `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

By consolidating the blocks before comparison and using a stable sorting mechanism, the corrected version ensures that the comparison is done accurately even when the block order may vary.
