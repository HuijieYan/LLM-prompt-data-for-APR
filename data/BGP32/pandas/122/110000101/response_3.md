The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function attempts to sort blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. However, the issue is with comparing the mgr_locs, which are objects and cannot be compared directly for equality using `==`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare mgr_locs using a suitable method that can determine equality for BlockPlacements. One way to achieve this is by converting mgr_locs to a tuple before comparing. This will allow us to use tuple comparison which is appropriate for comparing the properties of the BlockPlacement objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function, we can now correctly compare the mgr_locs of different blocks when sorting. This fix addresses the buggy behavior by ensuring a proper comparison strategy is used for the BlockPlacements.
