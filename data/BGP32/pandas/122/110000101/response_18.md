### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the equality of two instances based on their `axes` and `blocks`. However, there is a bug in the function where it fails to account for the comparison of the blocks correctly. The function attempts to compare blocks by sorting them first, but the approach does not consider their actual content.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `equals` function where it sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting method does not guarantee the correct comparison of the block content.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks directly rather than relying on sorting blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the blocks for equality without relying on sorting.
