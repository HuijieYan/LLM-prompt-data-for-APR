The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the way blocks are being compared after sorting. The function is comparing blocks from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their type names and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` attribute is only used in the `canonicalize` function and not in the actual comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to include the `mgr_locs` attribute when comparing blocks. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `equals` method for blocks is consistently comparing the block data.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare each block in sorted lists
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are compared properly, including their `mgr_locs`, to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
