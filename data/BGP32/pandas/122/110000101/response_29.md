### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the `BlockManager` class relies on comparing the equality of its internal structures, specifically the `blocks`, which are lists of blocks containing data. The comparison logic in the `equals` function does not handle the comparison of these internal block structures correctly. It attempts to sort the blocks based on type and location, but the block comparison logic itself is flawed leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should compare the data within each block to check for equality. This can be achieved by iterating through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and comparing the blocks based on their data content. Additionally, we should handle cases where the number of blocks in `self` and `other` may be different.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        # Check if the blocks are equal
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    # Check for equality of each block in self and other
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not compare_blocks(block1, block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison logic correctly checks for equality of the internal block structures by comparing the data content within each block. It addresses the bug by iterating through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and comparing them using the `equals` method provided by the blocks themselves.
