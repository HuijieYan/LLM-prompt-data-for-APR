The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is made using the `equals` method, but this method does not properly handle the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` class.

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic between blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Instead of using the `equals` method, we should directly compare the blocks using their attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the number of blocks is the same
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in self_blocks and other_blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block = self.blocks[i]
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape or self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
            return False
        
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the attributes of each block in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists to determine if they are equal. This approach ensures a proper comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` class and should fix the bug in the `equals` function.
