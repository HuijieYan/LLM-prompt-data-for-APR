### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function is sorting the blocks based on a `canonicalize` function which uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for comparison. However, the bug occurs because the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` does not have an attribute `as_array`, causing an AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `block` objects without raising an AttributeError on `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. We can extract the essential information from the block object that allows it to be uniquely identified and compared.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function utilizes the `type(block).__name__` and `block.values` to uniquely identify and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects for equality.
