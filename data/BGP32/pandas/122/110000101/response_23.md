The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks. The bug in the function occurs when comparing the blocks' data types and memory locations. The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle the block's memory locations comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the memory locations comparison of the blocks. This will ensure that when sorting blocks, they are correctly compared based on their data type and memory location.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now includes sorting based on both data type and memory locations, ensuring a correct comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
