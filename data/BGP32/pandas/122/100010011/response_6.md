### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other` based on their axes, blocks, and ordering.
2. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the function returned `True` incorrectly.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the specific case where identical blocks with different locations are not being correctly handled by the `equals` function.
4. The issue arises from the `canonicalize` function, which helps sort and compare blocks based on their dtype name and locations, causing the erroneous comparison result.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks for comparison does not consider blocks with identical content but different locations, which leads to `equals` incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames with blocks in different positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate a more detailed method for identifying and comparing blocks, considering the content and the locations. This will ensure that even when blocks are in different positions, the comparison will correctly identify them as different.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_dict(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrections in the `canonicalize` function, the function should now correctly handle cases where DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.
