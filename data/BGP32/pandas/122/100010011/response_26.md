### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file is used to check if two objects are equal. The error message is indicating that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring when comparing two DataFrames with different values but the same shape. The comparison method used in the `equals` function is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks in the two DataFrames.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison method used within the `equals` function. The function is unable to accurately identify the differences between the blocks of two DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to correctly identify the differences between the blocks of two DataFrames and return `False` when they are not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.values.data.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function provided above, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass successfully. This updated logic should accurately identify differences between the blocks of two DataFrames and return `False` when they are not equal.
