### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two pandas objects for equality.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals()` method returns `True` instead of `False` in a specific case where the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.
- The function relies on sorting the blocks using a canonicalization function that includes block dtype name and manager locations. In cases where blocks have the same content but different locations, this leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to accurately identify identical blocks irrespective of their locations.
- We should modify the comparison logic to account for these changes and ensure that the function correctly identifies equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # New canonicalize function to accurately identify identical blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Result:
- The corrected version of the `equals()` function should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
