### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames based on their column axes and blocks.
2. The test case provided in the GitHub issue is failing because the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have the same columns but in a different order, which should result in `equals()` returning `False`, but it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting mechanism used in the `canonicalize` function. This sorting is done based on the data type name and block locations, which can result in identical blocks with different locations being compared as equal. In the case of the test example, the columns are the same but in a different order, leading to an incorrect `True` result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the column names in the sorting criteria. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the complete block content and structure instead of just the data type name and block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self_columns = self.columns.tolist()
    other_columns = other.columns.tolist()
    
    if self_columns != other_columns:
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self._data.items()
    other_blocks = other._data.items()

    # check the equality at each block level
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the DataFrames based on their columns and blocks directly, ensuring that both the column names and the block content are considered in the equality check. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals()` function behave correctly.
