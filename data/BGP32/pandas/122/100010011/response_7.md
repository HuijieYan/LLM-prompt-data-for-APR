### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing the blocks within each DataFrame.
2. The failing test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` since the data in the DataFrames are not the same, but the actual output is `True`, leading to the assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is mistakenly considering DataFrames with different data but identical blocks as equal due to the way it compares the blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrames rather than just the blocks themselves.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the data within the blocks to check for actual equality
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_data[i], other_data[i]) for i in range(len(self_data))
    )
```

By comparing the actual data within the blocks using `np.array_equal`, we ensure that the DataFrames are considered equal only if their data is the same, not just their block structure. This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the test pass successfully.
