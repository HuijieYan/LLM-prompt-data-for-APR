### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `DataFrame` objects to check if they are equal. 
- The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`, resulting in an assertion error.
- The GitHub issue highlights that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. In this case, it is expected to return `False`.
- The issue is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on the block's data type name and manager locations, which may lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
- The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may lead to the blocks being sorted differently even if they have the same data, resulting in a wrong comparison outcome.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their data values rather than their dtype names and manager locations. This way, identical blocks with different locations will still be considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the comparison of `DataFrame` objects and return the correct result when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
