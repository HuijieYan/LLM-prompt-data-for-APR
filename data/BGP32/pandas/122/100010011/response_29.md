### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is supposed to compare two DataFrame objects to check if they are equal.
- The error message indicates that the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it returned True instead of False.
- The GitHub issue also points out that the `equals` function wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The issue is related to how the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort and compare blocks in the DataFrames.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks based on type and location might cause blocks to be considered equal when they are not.

### Suggested Fix:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to include the actual content of the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block content for comparison, the corrected version should fix the bug and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
