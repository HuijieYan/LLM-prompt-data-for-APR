### Analysis:
- The function `equals` is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects but fails to handle the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations.
- The error message points to a specific failing test where two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with the same data but in a different order, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
- The GitHub issue also highlights the exact problem with `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Cause:
- The current implementation of the `equals` method does not consider the case where blocks have identical content but may be stored at different locations.
- The function attempts to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which may lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data within blocks to properly differentiate blocks with identical content but different locations.
- Update the comparison step to handle the case where blocks with identical content are stored at different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's values, dtype name, and manager locations, the corrected `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This change should address the specific issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
