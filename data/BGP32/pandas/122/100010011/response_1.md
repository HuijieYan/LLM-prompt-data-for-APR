### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is meant to compare two `DataFrame` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test is trying to check if two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are equal, but the assertion fails.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing with `assert True is False`.
- The GitHub issue highlights the specific case where the `equals` method fails to return False when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

### Error:
The error occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks by type name and manager locations is not able to distinguish between two DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations. This causes the `equals` method to improperly return True.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames when blocks are identical but located differently.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block values instead of locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return repr(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks by their values instead of locations. This change ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are properly compared for equality.
