### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing the equality of two sets of blocks in a DataFrame.
2. The error message indicates an assertion error where the function is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when given two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be the comparison of blocks without considering their locations.
5. A possible strategy to fix the bug is to modify the comparison logic to also consider the locations of the blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check if blocks are identical in content and location
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2) and block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs)

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account both the content and location of the blocks when comparing DataFrames for equality. This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function returns the correct result.
