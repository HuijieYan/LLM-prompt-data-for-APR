### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas is not correctly identifying DataFrames as equal when the blocks within the DataFrames have different locations. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The failing test case provided in the GitHub issue highlights this problem.

### Identified Potential Error:
The error occurs when comparing the blocks of the DataFrames using the `equals` method, as the comparison does not consider the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, which is not accounting for cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations. This can be achieved by ensuring that the block comparison considers the content of the blocks and not just their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then the content of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the content of the blocks by using `block.values` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which accounts for unconsolidated blocks with identical content but different locations. This modification ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
