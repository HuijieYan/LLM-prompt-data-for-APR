### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file is used to compare two internal data structures in pandas. The error message from the failing test shows that the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs due to the comparison not accounting for the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations, leading to a mismatch in the result.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting mechanism in the function which sorts blocks based on the tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting method can lead to false positives in comparison when blocks having the same data but different locations are compared.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include sorting based on `block.values`, which contain the actual data values, instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This change will ensure that the comparison factors in the actual data in the blocks instead of the type name and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the data values from the blocks for sorting instead of the type name and locations, the corrected function should now properly compare the blocks and handle cases where the data is the same but the locations differ.
