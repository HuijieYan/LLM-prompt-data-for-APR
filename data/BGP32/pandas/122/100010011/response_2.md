### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function provided is used for comparing two `DataFrame` objects to check if they are equal. The issue seems to be related to comparing DataFrame objects where the columns have the same data but in different locations.
2. The error message from the failing test suggests that the comparison between the two DataFrames is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug likely occurs due to the comparison being based on the order of blocks in memory rather than the actual data.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual data rather than the memory locations of blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on memory locations, we should compare them based on the actual data they contain.
2. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on both column values and ignoring the order of the columns, as the order of columns should not affect the equality check.
3. By ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual block data rather than their locations, we can fix the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column values
    def sort_block(block):
        return tuple(block.get(item) for item in block._info_axis)[0]

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_block)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on column values and comparing them for equality without considering their memory locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
