### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is responsible for checking the equality of two objects. In this case, it is used to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.
- The error message indicates that the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed due to `True is False`.
- The bug is related to the issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The issue's description mentions that when two DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`, resulting in a failed test.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug stems from the fact that the `equals` method does not handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly. This leads to a false positive in the equality check.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we should update the `equals` method to consider the block contents as well as their locations during comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    canonicalize = lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above corrections, the `equals` method should now properly compare the values and locations of blocks in the DataFrames, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
