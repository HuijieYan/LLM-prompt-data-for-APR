### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is used to check if two DataFrames are equal based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the function is returning `True` instead of `False`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where the function incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The issue seems to be related to how the function handles block comparison.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the comparison of blocks in DataFrames. Specifically, the `canonicalize(block)` function does not consider the actual values within the block when determining equality. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, resulting in an incorrect return value from the `equals` function.

### Strategy to Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to compare not only the block properties but also the actual values within the blocks to determine equality. This will ensure that DataFrames with different block locations but different values are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `block.values` for comparison, ensuring that the actual values within the blocks are considered when determining equality. This should address the bug and fix the failing test case as described in the GitHub issue.
