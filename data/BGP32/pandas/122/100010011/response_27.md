### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, resulting in `assert True is False`. This implies that `df1.equals(df2)` erroneously returned `True` instead of `False`. The issue in the GitHub post suggests that the `DataFrame.equals()` method incorrectly returns `True` in cases where there are identical blocks but with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function's implementation does not properly handle the case where two DataFrames have identical blocks but differ in their locations. This is due to the way the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block values and their locations when comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. This modification should ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both values and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
