### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is designed to compare two DataFrame objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block data are equal. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue aligns with the GitHub issue description where the user expected the comparison to return `False` but it returned `True`.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison of DataFrame blocks where two DataFrames have identical data but different locations due to unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of `canonicalize()` function to sort the blocks based on block type and locations. This leads to the incorrect comparison of blocks having the same data but different locations, resulting in the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider only the block data and type for equality and not the block locations. By removing the sorting based on locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the DataFrame blocks based on their values only, using `tobytes()` method to convert block values to bytes for comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
