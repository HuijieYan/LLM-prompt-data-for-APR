### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is supposed to compare two internal data structures for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic between blocks in the two DataFrames.
2. The canonicalization of blocks based on type names and locations might not be accurate.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused due to the fact that the comparison of blocks in the two DataFrames is not taking into consideration the different block locations. In the provided test case, the blocks in the two DataFrames are identical but located in different positions. The canonicalization of blocks based on type names and locations is leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider both the content of blocks and their respective locations. By modifying the canonicalization function to include block locations uniquely, we can ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Adjusted canonicalize function to include block data and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block values along with their locations, we ensure that identical blocks in different locations are not considered equal. This correction will address the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
