### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `DataFrame` objects for equality. The error message from the failing test indicates that when comparing two dataframes with different values and data types, the function returns `True` incorrectly instead of `False`, leading to a failed assertion.

### Potential error locations:
1. Comparison logic inside the `equals` function.
2. Potential issues with sorting the blocks for comparison.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the comparison logic that does not correctly handle cases where blocks have the same elements but different data types or ordering. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type names and `mgr_locs`, which may not guarantee a proper comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle cases where data types or ordering are different.
2. Refactor the sorting method to ensure a correct comparison order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block, oblock, check_dtype=False) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. Blocks are sorted based on the `dtype.name` and `index` to ensure a correct comparison order.
2. The comparison now uses `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` to handle cases where data types may be different.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
