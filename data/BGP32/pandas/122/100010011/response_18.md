### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in pandas appears to be incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the failing test to assert that `True is False`, leading to the failed test case.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be correctly handling blocks with identical data but different internal locations.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function might not be deterministic, leading to different orderings on different runs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the comparison of DataFrames based on the blocks without considering the fact that blocks with identical data but different internal locations should not be considered equal. This was not properly handled in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual data content and not just the locations of the blocks. This might involve modifying the `canonicalize` function or the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a tuple of data values to canonicalize instead of location
        return tuple(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the actual data values for canonicalization instead of block locations, we can ensure that the correct comparison is made. This should address the bug and allow the function to correctly compare DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
