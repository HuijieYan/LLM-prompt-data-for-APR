### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames by their axes, blocks, and block equality. However, the bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect result.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison logic for the blocks may be incorrect.
2. Sorting logic for the blocks based on their type name and locations may not be capturing the uniqueness properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared. This leads to incorrect results in DataFrame comparison due to the sorting logic based on block type names and locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for blocks to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly. The sorting logic should be updated to reflect the uniqueness of blocks based on their actual content rather than just their types and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import pandas as pd

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on actual content, not just type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._is_numeric, block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

# Apply the corrected version to the DataFrame class
pd.DataFrame.equals = equals

# Test the corrected version
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should handle comparing identical blocks with different locations correctly, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
