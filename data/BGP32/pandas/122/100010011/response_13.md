### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `DataFrame` objects and check if they are equal. The error message indicates that the test is failing with a `True is False` assertion error, which suggests that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. The GitHub issue also confirms this problem with the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly.

### Error Location:
The issue is likely to be with the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations, but this sorting may not be effectively distinguishing between unconsolidated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of unconsolidated blocks within the DataFrames. When sorting the blocks, their type name and locations are not sufficient to differentiate between them, leading to incorrect equality check results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are sorted to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are distinguishable based on more specific criteria, such as checking if the blocks are categorical. This adjustment should prevent the faulty equality comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version updates the `canonicalize` function to use the block type and values for sorting, which should provide a more accurate distinction between blocks. This modification should resolve the issue and make the equality comparison work correctly.
