### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
- The error message indicates that the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are considered equal by the `equals` method, which is incorrect.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where two DataFrames are considered equal even though they have different block locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be properly distinguishing blocks with different locations.
2. The comparison logic between the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` method fails to properly differentiate between identical blocks that have different locations. Due to this, DataFrames with differently ordered columns are mistakenly considered equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to ensure that the location information of blocks is considered when determining equality. We should update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information, and modify the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to account for this information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # Include block location

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block location in the `canonicalize` function and using it during sorting and comparison, we ensure that DataFrames with different block locations are correctly identified as unequal. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
