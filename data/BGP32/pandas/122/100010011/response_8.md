### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is used to compare DataFrames for equality based on their axes, blocks, and data values.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated `True is False`.
- The issue on GitHub highlights a bug where `DataFrame.equals()` incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The issue is caused by the way blocks are sorted and compared, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when DataFrames contain identical blocks with different locations, resulting in incorrect equality evaluation.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their types and locations.
- Even for DataFrames with the same blocks but different locations, the function evaluates them as unequal due to block sorting based on locations.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the comparison logic to consider block equality based on their content, not just locations.
- Instead of sorting blocks by type and location, compare blocks directly for equality.
- Update the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content to handle cases with identical blocks but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality without sorting based on locations, the corrected version should properly handle cases where DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations and return the correct equality evaluation.
