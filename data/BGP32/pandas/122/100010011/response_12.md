### Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two DataFrame objects for equality, considering their axes and block values.
- The provided error message indicates that the test failed with an unexpected result. The expected output was `False`, but the actual output was `True`.
- The GitHub issue highlights a bug in the code where identical blocks with different locations are mistakenly considered equal.
- The issue arises due to the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks, which does not account for the location of blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Identification of Error:
- The `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks does not consider the locations of blocks, leading to false equality comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not differentiate blocks with the same content but different locations. Hence, when sorting blocks using this function, blocks with identical content but different locations can be considered equal.

### Fixing the Bug:
- One way to fix the bug is to incorporate block locations into the sorting mechanism, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are not wrongly identified as equal.
- This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Incorporate block's content and location into the sorting key
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), list(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

- The corrected version ensures that blocks are sorted based on content and location, preventing false equality comparisons.
- With this modification, the `equals` function should provide correct results and address the issue reported on GitHub.
