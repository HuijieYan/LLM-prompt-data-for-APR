### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is failing to correctly identify that two DataFrames are not equal when they have identical blocks but with different locations. This issue is causing the tests to fail with an assertion error stating that `True is False`.

### Identified Potential Error:
The issue lies in the comparison of DataFrames in the function `equals()`. The DataFrame blocks are not properly compared due to the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function is sorting DataFrame blocks based on the data type's name and `mgr_locs` instead of comparing the actual data values.
2. This sorting mechanism causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal, leading to incorrect results in the equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function or sorting mechanism to accurately compare DataFrame blocks based on their actual values.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the data within the blocks rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        # Check if blocks are equal
        if block.shape != oblock.shape:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
            return False
        return True

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `equals()` function to compare actual values in the blocks rather than their locations, the function will now correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal. This updated version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
