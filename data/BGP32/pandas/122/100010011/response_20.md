### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two objects for equality by comparing their attributes and blocks.
2. The failing test provides two DataFrames that have identical blocks but in different locations.
3. The failing test expected `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it returned `True`, causing the assertion error.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. When sorting the blocks in the function, it uses a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` to distinguish blocks. This method fails to account for the scenario where two blocks have the same content but different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function to accurately determine equality based on block content rather than solely on block type and location. This adjustment will address the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # change the canonicalize function to compare block content and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_dict(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the function now accurately compares blocks based on content and data type, resolving the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations. This fix should pass the failing test and address the bug reported on GitHub.
