### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) to check if they are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The issue on GitHub also describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method fails to return `False` for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
4. The problem seems to be related to how the blocks are compared and sorted for equality.

### Bug Cause:
The issue likely arises because the function `canonicalize` is generating tuples to sort the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. If identical blocks are at different locations, the sorting based on mgr_locs can incorrectly consider them as different.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the dtype name for sorting the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic to loop through the sorted blocks and check for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now successfully compare DataFrames and return `False` for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
