### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is used to compare two DataFrames for equality.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes in both DataFrames are equal. If not, it returns False.
3. It then proceeds to compare each block of data within each DataFrame.
4. The bug seems to occur when comparing blocks with the same data but different memory locations.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by combining the type name and memory locations (`mgr_locs`) may lead to different memory locations being considered unequal, even if the data is the same.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to better handle blocks with identical data but different memory locations. One approach could be to compare the data itself rather than focusing on memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to simply return the block data itself, we ensure that blocks with identical data are considered equal regardless of memory location. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
