### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the fact that the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not comparing the block values correctly. Specifically, when calling `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` inside the `canonicalize` function, it was resulting in incorrect comparison of block locations. This caused the function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks had the same values but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done based on their values rather than their locations. One way to achieve this is to compare the block values directly instead of comparing the block locations. By doing so, we can accurately determine if the blocks are equal irrespective of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function which compares the blocks based on their values:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._internal_get_values())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._internal_get_values())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `x._internal_get_values()` as the key for sorting the blocks, we are comparing the actual values of the blocks, hence fixing the bug and ensuring that the function returns the correct result.

This correction should address the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
