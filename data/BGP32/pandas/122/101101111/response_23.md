## Bug Analysis:

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the sorting logic based on block characteristics like dtype and mgr_locs, which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly deemed unequal.

In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, DataFrame `df1` and `df2` have identical data but differing column order. The `equals` function should return False in this scenario but is erroneously returning True due to the incorrect block comparison logic.

The runtime values and types of variables within the `equals` function indicate issue locations where block sorting might lead to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To resolve this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic within the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, we should compare the blocks directly without canonicalizing them.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks within `self` and `other` instances without relying on sorting by dtype and mgr_locs. This adjustment ensures that identical data with different locations are properly recognized as equal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
