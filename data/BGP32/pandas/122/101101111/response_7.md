### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue is that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This happens because when comparing blocks for equality, the function sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which results in identical blocks with different locations being considered as unequal.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks based on dtype and locations, we should directly compare the blocks in the original order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the function directly compares the blocks in their original order without sorting based on dtype and locations, resolving the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
