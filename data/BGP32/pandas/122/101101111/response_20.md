### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes, blocks, and block types between two instances. The issue arises from the fact that when comparing blocks, the locations of the blocks are not taken into account.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the `equals` function to return False for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on the block type and locations before comparison.
- The bug is causing the function to return True incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from not considering the locations of blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` function. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks considers the actual locations of the blocks to differentiate between them.
- The key for sorting the blocks should be a combination of block type and block locations for a complete check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.get_tuple_location())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `get_tuple_location()` method in each block to retrieve the correct locations, we ensure that blocks are correctly sorted and compared, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
