### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to stem from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The issue arises when blocks have identical content but different locations. The `canonicalize` function currently compares block types and locations, leading to erroneous true comparisons. To fix this issue, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider block content for comparison. This change will accurately determine block equality without being affected by block locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function modifies the `canonicalize` function to compare block content only using the `values` attribute. This change ensures that blocks with identical content are treated as equal, regardless of their locations. By updating the comparison metric, the function now correctly determines the equality of blocks based on content, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
