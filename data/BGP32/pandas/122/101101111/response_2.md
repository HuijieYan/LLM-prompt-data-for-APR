## Bug Fix for the Buggy Function

### Bug Analysis:
The bug arises in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class where it is incorrectly determining the equality of blocks within two `BlockManager` objects. The bug is primarily due to the incorrect comparison of blocks without considering their ordering in the comparison. This causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks have the same elements but in a different order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a canonical representation. This canonical representation should take into account the type name and the manager locations of the blocks. By sorting the blocks in a consistent way, we can ensure a correct comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Expected Outcome:
The corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager` objects. It will return `False` for cases where the blocks have identical elements but in a different order, which aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
