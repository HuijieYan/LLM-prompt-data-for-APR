### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It fails to correctly compare blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Specifically, the bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks' locations instead of their actual contents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Perform a proper comparison of the content of the blocks rather than their locations.
2. Update the comparison logic within the `equals` method to compare the blocks individually based on their content.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Perform actual comparison of blocks by their contents
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By updating the logic in the `equals` method to compare the blocks' values rather than their locations, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and correctly compare `BlockManager` objects.
