The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of blocks between two instances. The issue arises due to the comparison of block locations in addition to the data values. This results in the function erroneously returning `True` when blocks with identical data but different locations are compared.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block data type for comparison purposes. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies blocks with the same data values as equal, regardless of their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Other class methods are assumed to remain unchanged
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block data type for sorting blocks, we eliminate the erroneous behavior of the `equals` function when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
