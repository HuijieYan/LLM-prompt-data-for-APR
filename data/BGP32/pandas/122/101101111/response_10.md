### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the block ordering not being properly handled. The function tries to compare blocks between two `BlockManager` instances but fails to consider the order of blocks in them. This results in incorrect comparisons and the function returning the wrong result.

### Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block sorting is consistent between the two `BlockManager` instances before performing the block-level comparisons. By sorting the blocks based on their properties, we can eliminate the inconsistency in comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), str(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))  # Sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the changes made to include the sorting based on dtype name and manager locations in the blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
