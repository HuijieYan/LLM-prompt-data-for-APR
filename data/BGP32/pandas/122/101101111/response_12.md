After analyzing the buggy function, specifically the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, and considering the provided runtime and expected values, I've identified the issue causing the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.

### Issue:
The issue lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` method. It fails to consider different block locations in cases where blocks are identical but in different locations. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to properly handle cases where block locations might differ but the content of the blocks is the same.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the updated version of the `equals` method with a modification to properly compare blocks with different locations:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, incorporating block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method now accounts for block locations in the comparison logic, ensuring accurate equality checks between two `BlockManager` instances.

By applying this fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
