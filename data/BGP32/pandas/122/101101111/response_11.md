### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The function compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, compares the number of blocks, and then sorts and compares the individual blocks.
- The bug seems to be related to the way the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
- The issue arises from the incorrect usage of the `canonicalize` function in sorting the blocks.
- The `canonicalize` function uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, which does not seem to be a reliable identifier for block comparison.
- This incorrect identification causes the function to incorrectly report equality for blocks with different locations.

### Solution:
- We need to identify a better way to canonicalize or sort the blocks for comparison to ensure correct equality checking.
- Utilize more reliable attributes or properties of the blocks for sorting and comparison.
- Update the sorting mechanism to match the expected behavior of the equals function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on more reliable properties for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.shape, block.dtypes))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.shape, block.dtypes))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version adds a sorting mechanism based on the values, shape, and data types of the blocks for more accurate comparison. It should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
