## Bug Analysis:

### Issue:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to consider the order of the blocks during comparison, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug lies in the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a combination of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, it does not handle the case where the blocks have the same content but different locations, causing the comparison to fail.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` which combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
2. If two blocks have the same content but different `mgr_locs`, they will be sorted separately and fail the comparison.
3. This leads to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `False` for blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider only the content of the blocks and not the specific locations. The goal is to correctly identify blocks with the same content, even if they are located differently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def content_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.shape)  # Sort based on shape
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.shape)  # Sort based on shape
    return all(
        content_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the sorting mechanism to sort the blocks based on their shape to avoid considering the specific locations in the comparison.
2. Introduced `content_equals` function to compare the content of two blocks accurately.

By making these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now give the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
