The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

The bug is due to the sorting mechanism used within the function to compare the blocks. When sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, it fails to properly differentiate between blocks that have the same content but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block content (not just dtype and mgr_locs) for a more accurate comparison. By considering the block values besides dtype and mgr_locs, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as different.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are properly identified as different. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected.
