### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values but equivalent underlining data structure, leading to a False comparison. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior.
3. The buggy function incorrectly returns False when comparing the axes, then proceeds to compare the blocks without considering block locations.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to consider the actual locations of the blocks when comparing them. This involves ensuring that identical blocks with different locations do not falsely indicate inequality. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks considering the actual positions
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = dict((canonicalize(block), block) for block in other.blocks)

    for block in self_blocks:
        canon_block = canonicalize(block)
        if canon_block not in other_blocks or not block.equals(other_blocks[canon_block]):
            return False

    return True
```

By modifying the `equals` method to sort and compare blocks based on their canonical representation, taking into account the block location, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are considered equal. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
