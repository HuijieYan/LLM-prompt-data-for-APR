## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison order of blocks is not canonicalized correctly before comparing, leading to a false positive result in some cases. The issue is that the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) is not considering the type name (dtype) and locations of the blocks, which can vary for blocks of the same type. This results in identical blocks being considered unequal.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the canonicalization process should consider both the type name and the block locations. By updating the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the type name and block locations, we ensure that blocks are sorted according to these criteria before comparing them. This way, blocks with the same values but different locations will not be falsely flagged as unequal.

## Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both dtype and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects and provide the expected results, passing the failing test case provided.
