## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block type. The issue arises when handling identical blocks with different locations, which leads to incorrect equality comparison.

## Bug Location
The bug occurs within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the way identical blocks with different locations are handled during the comparison process inside the `equals` function. Due to the sorting based on block type and manager locations (mgr_locs), identical blocks at different locations can be mistakenly considered unequal.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider identical blocks with different locations as equal. One way to achieve this is by defining a function that compares blocks without considering their locations, ensuring that blocks are compared solely based on their content.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b.dtype.name)

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `compare_blocks` function to compare blocks based on their values irrespective of locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug as described.
