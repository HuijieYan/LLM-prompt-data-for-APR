### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality where the blocks are present in a different order within the `blocks` attribute. The function incorrectly considers the ordering of the blocks during comparison, leading to false positives in equality checks.

In the failing test case provided, when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances is different, resulting in `equals` incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be adjusted to consider the equality of blocks irrespective of their order. This can be achieved by properly sorting the blocks before comparison based on a criteria that defines their equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to sort blocks for comparison
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.values))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type and values before comparison, the corrected `equals` function ensures that the order of blocks does not affect the result, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
