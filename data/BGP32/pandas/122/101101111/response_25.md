## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations. The current implementation does not account for the locations of the blocks when performing the comparison, leading to false positives where identical blocks with different locations are deemed equal.

The function first ensures that the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal in length. Then, it proceeds to compare each block in the `self.blocks` attribute with the corresponding block in the `other.blocks` attribute. However, by sorting the blocks based only on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` without considering their actual content and locations within the `BlockManager`, the function can mistakenly return `True` for cases where the blocks are in different physical locations but contain the same data.

## Fix Strategy

To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to properly identify the blocks based on both their content and physical locations. By considering both the block's data and its location within the `BlockManager`, we can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both data and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between blocks takes into account both the content (`values`) and physical location (`mgr_locs`) of each block, providing an accurate assessment of equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
