## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test case to fail. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances, checks if they have the same axes, consolidates them in place, and then compares their blocks by canonicalizing them based on type name and manager locations.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug may be due to comparing the blocks before consolidating them in place. This can lead to incorrect comparisons when blocks have the same content but different locations. The `equals` function should consolidate both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances before comparing their blocks.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to consolidate both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances before comparing their blocks. This will ensure that blocks are compared accurately regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function consolidates both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances before comparing their blocks. Sorting the blocks by type and manager locations ensures a consistent comparison even for blocks with the same content but different locations.

After applying this correction, the `df1.equals(df2)` test case should return `False` as expected.

By making these changes, the Bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
