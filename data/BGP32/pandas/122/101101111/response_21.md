The problem in the buggy function lies in the comparison logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue arises when blocks have identical content but are in different locations (mgr_locs), causing them not to be considered equal.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to focus only on the content of the blocks and not their locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider only the `dtype.name` for sorting. This change will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are now correctly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the comparison now focuses purely on the dtype name, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as equal. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and allows the failing test to pass successfully.
