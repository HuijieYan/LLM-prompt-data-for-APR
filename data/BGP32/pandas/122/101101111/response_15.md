To address the bug in the `equals` function and ensure it passes the failing test, we need to make the following corrections:

1. The bug lies in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by sorting them using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function currently relies on `block.dtype.name` to uniquely identify blocks, which might not be sufficient when blocks have identical types but different locations (as indicated in the GitHub issue).

2. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the location of blocks as well, ensuring that blocks with the same type but different locations are treated as distinct.

3. We also need to update the expected values of specific variables in the function's return to reflect the corrected comparison logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrections made, the `equals` function should now properly handle comparisons between blocks with distinct locations and pass the failing test.
