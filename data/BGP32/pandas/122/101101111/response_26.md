### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The issue arises from comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation in the `equals` function of `BlockManager`.
2. To resolve this, we need to sort the blocks based on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent comparison.
3. Additionally, we should take into account unconsolidated blocks that might have different orderings.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function in `BlockManager`:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs 
    # considering unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now be able to properly evaluate equality even when dealing with identical blocks with different locations.
