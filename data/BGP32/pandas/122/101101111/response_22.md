### Analysis
The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects containing axes and blocks. It checks if the axes are the same length and if each axis is equal, then consolidates both objects in place, sorts the blocks for comparison, and checks if each block is equal with the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` highlights a case where two `DataFrame` objects should not be considered equal, but the buggy function returns `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not consistent with the desired behavior. It sorts based on the block's data type name and the `mgr_locs` converted to a list, which might vary even if the blocks are logically equivalent. This inconsistency leads to incorrect equality determination.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks with the same data type name and locations are considered equal. We can compare the actual data in the blocks instead of relying on potentially differing `mgr_locs` representations.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())  # comparing block values instead of mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the block values in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks are sorted consistently based on their actual content, leading to correct equality evaluation.

This corrected version should resolve the bug identified in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
