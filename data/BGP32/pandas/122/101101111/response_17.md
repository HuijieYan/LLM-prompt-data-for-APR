### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, but the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` where `block.dtype.name` might not be unique when comparing two blocks that have different data types but equivalent values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is not solely based on the dtype name, as it might cause blocks with different data types but equivalent values to be considered equal. We can enhance the `canonicalize` function to take into account the block values while sorting, ensuring a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison is based on the block values, ensuring that blocks with different data types but equivalent values will not be wrongly considered equal.
