### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function sorts blocks by their type name and `mgr_locs` to try to distinguish them. However, when comparing the blocks for equality, it fails to consider the order of the blocks. This can lead to the function returning `True` when the actual blocks are not in the same order in both `self` and `other` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of blocks when comparing them for equality. We can modify the comparison process to ensure that not only the blocks themselves are equal but also their positions in the BlockManager. This will correctly handle cases where the blocks are identical but in different positions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = list(sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize))
    other_blocks = list(sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Expected Outcome:
The corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where the blocks are identical but in different positions. The failing test should now pass as it correctly identifies that `df1` and `df2` are not equal and return `False`.
