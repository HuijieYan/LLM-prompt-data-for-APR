### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager.equals()` function using `sorted()` with a custom key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function is comparing blocks based on their data type and the location of the blocks within the manager. However, in the buggy function, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is used, which creates a list representation of the Block's location, losing the original object structure. This results in incorrect comparisons as the location information is not preserved.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately, taking into account the block locations. Instead of converting the `mgr_locs` to a list, we should use the original `mgr_locs` object itself for comparison within the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals()` function retains the original `mgr_locs` object in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that block locations are accurately compared.
