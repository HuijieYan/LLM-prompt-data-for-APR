Based on the runtime values and types of variables and the expected values and types, the issue arises because the `canonicalize` function is not used consistently to compare the blocks in both `self` and `other` instances of the `BlockManager` class. The identification of blocks should be consistent for proper comparison.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is applied consistently to both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them. This will ensure that the blocks are properly distinguished and compared based on their type and location.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Apply canonicalize function to blocks for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly compare the blocks in `self` and `other` instances based on their type and location, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test case.
