The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the sort order of the blocks being compared without considering their locations. This can lead to falsely identifying blocks with identical content but different locations as unequal.

To fix this bug, we need to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations in the comparison process.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Include block locations in the canonicalization process
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the block locations are included in the `canonicalize` function by using `tobytes()` instead of `tolist()`. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will be correctly identified as equal.

By making this change, the `equals` function will now properly handle cases where blocks have the same values but different locations, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
