### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block locations.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function is wrongly returning True even when the blocks have identical data but different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not consider the specific block locations while comparing, leading to incorrect equality results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for block locations.
5. We will update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for distinguishing between blocks that have identical data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider block locations in addition to data for accurate equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will now properly account for the block locations while comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
