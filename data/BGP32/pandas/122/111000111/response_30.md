### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug seems to arise when checking for equality between blocks. The bug causes the method to return `True` when it should return `False`, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the block comparison part of the function where it tries to canonicalize the blocks using the `canonicalize` function and then compares each block element-wise.

### Bug Explanation
The issue arises when comparing blocks due to the failure to correctly identify blocks that are identical in content but have different locations (as observed in the `df3.equals(df4)` case). The use of `mgr_locs` for identification is not considering the scenario where blocks are the same but located differently. This causes the `equals` method to erroneously return `True` when comparing such blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly identify identical blocks disregarding their locations. We should focus on the block content itself rather than the location within the `BlockManager`. This will ensure that if two blocks have the same content, the comparison will rightfully return `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare only based on content, ignoring location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their content rather than their locations. It should now properly handle cases where blocks have the same content but are located differently, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
