### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the length of the axes of both instances is the same, then iterates over the axes to compare them. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function then calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both instances to ensure the blocks are consolidated, then compares the length of the blocks. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
4. It then proceeds to sort the blocks of both instances by their type name and location to handle unconsolidated blocks.
5. Finally, it compares each block between the two instances using the `equals` method of the blocks.

### Issue:
The bug arises from a case where two identical blocks can have different locations but are still equal. The function fails to consider this scenario leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of individual blocks. Instead of solely relying on the `equals` method of the blocks, we should compare them based on their content rather than their locations.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if block.dtype == oblock.dtype else False for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content by checking their data type in addition to using the `equals` method. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post while maintaining the functionality of the function.
