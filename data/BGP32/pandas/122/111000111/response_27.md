### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. In the buggy function, the comparison of axes is correct, but when comparing blocks, it fails to consider the order of the blocks.
3. The bug is related to the comparison of the blocks without considering their order, resulting in `equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks before comparison based on a canonical form that considers both the data type name and the manager locations.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Create a canonicalize function that returns a tuple of data type name and manager locations as a list for a block.
2. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects based on this canonical form before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the canonical form, the corrected function will compare `BlockManager` objects considering the order of blocks, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
