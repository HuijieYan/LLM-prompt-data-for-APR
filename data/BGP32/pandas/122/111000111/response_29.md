The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by incorrect handling of block locations in the comparison. The bug can lead to `equals` wrongly returning `True` even if blocks have identical data but with different locations.

One potential strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers not only the content but also the block locations. One way to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block positions as part of the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and block data along with locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version enhances the `canonicalize` function to consider both block values and locations when comparing blocks. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that `equals` returns the correct result when comparing blocks with identical data but different locations.
