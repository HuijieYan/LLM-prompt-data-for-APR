### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks within them. 
2. The buggy function compares the exact block order which might lead to incorrect results because blocks with the same data but different locations would not be considered equal.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to false positives in the comparison of `BlockManager` instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks rather than just the order. By sorting the blocks based on content, we can correctly handle cases where the blocks have different locations.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their location within the `BlockManager`. This corrected version addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue and ensures correct comparison of `BlockManager` instances.
