### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing the `axes` attribute of two `BlockManager` instances and then proceeds to compare the blocks within them.
2. The bug identified in the GitHub issue is related to the comparison of blocks with different locations but the same data.
3. The issue arises from the fact that the comparison of blocks is done based on their order, and not the actual content.
4. To fix this bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks instead of just their order.
5. We should update the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to ensure that blocks with the same data are considered equal regardless of their specific order.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Map blocks to a unique identifier based on content
    def block_id(block):
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_block_ids = {block_id(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_ids = {block_id(block): block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if self_block_ids.keys() != other_block_ids.keys():
        return False
    
    for block_id, block in self_block_ids.items():
        if not block.equals(other_block_ids[block_id]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks in `self` and `other` based on the content of their `values` attribute. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly considered equal.
