The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The current implementation sorts and compares the blocks using a tuple of type name and manager locations as a key. However, this approach fails when there are identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect True returns.

To fix this bug, a more robust comparison criterion needs to be implemented. One possible solution is to iterate over the blocks and compare them based on both content and their positions in the manager. This way, identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version includes a loop that iterates over each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, comparing them using the `equals` method of the Block class. This ensures that blocks are compared based on their content and locations, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
