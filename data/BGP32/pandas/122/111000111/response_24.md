### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes, then consolidates the blocks of data within each `BlockManager` instance, and finally compares the blocks using a canonicalized order.
2. The bug in the current implementation is that it wrongly returns True even when the blocks have identical data but at different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this bug where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function does not consider the actual content of the blocks but rather their order and locations, leading to incorrect True values even for different locations of the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should focus on the content of the blocks rather than their order or locations. By comparing the data within the blocks directly, the function should correctly identify identical data as equal, even if they are located differently.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without considering order or location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b._get_values().reshape(-1).tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b._get_values().reshape(-1).tobytes())
    return all(
        self_block._get_values().equals(other_block._get_values())
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the data content of the blocks by converting the values into byte representations for comparison. This approach ensures that the blocks are considered equal if their content is the same, regardless of their locations within the block.
