### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks of both objects in place and compares each block by sorting them based on type and location.
2. The bug might be related to the block comparison step since it seems to be comparing the block objects directly without considering their content.
3. The bug occurs when comparing blocks of the same type but with different locations, leading to a false positive result for equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks instead of just their type and location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to compare the actual data within each block instead of just their type and location.
2. This can be achieved by iterating over the block data and comparing element-wise equality.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_block_data(block1, block2):
        return np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        compare_block_data(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function now iterates over the blocks and compares the actual values of the blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure accurate equality checking.
