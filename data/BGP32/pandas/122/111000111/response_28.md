### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking the equality of two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations.
4. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks without considering the block locations, which can lead to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Issue Cause:
1. The buggy function compares blocks using a canonicalization function that only considers the block type (`dtype.name`) and not the block locations (`mgr_locs`).
2. If identical blocks have different locations, this canonicalization will result in incorrect equality even though the blocks themselves are the same.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` along with `dtype.name` for canonicalization.
2. This modification will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are properly distinguished.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations `mgr_locs` within the canonicalization function, this corrected version ensures that blocks with the same data content but different locations are correctly distinguished when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
