### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes, blocks, and content. The bug seems to be related to how the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared in the function.

### Identified Errors
1. The function doesn't handle the comparison of blocks between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function may not yield the desired result in all cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations due to how the blocks are sorted and checked for equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Change the block comparison logic to ensure that blocks are correctly compared even if their locations are different.
2. Revise the block sorting approach to handle the comparison more accurately.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Existing functions here

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.data.tobytes()
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will now compare the blocks based on their actual values rather than sorting by certain block properties. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
