### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. 
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations but the same content, leading to an incorrect return value.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations when it should return `False`.
4. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic while iterating through `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
5. The strategy to fix the bug involves modifying the comparison logic to consider content instead of exact block locations.

### Bug Fix:
After analyzing the issue, we can fix the bug in the `equals` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their content, which will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are treated as equivalent. This change addresses the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
