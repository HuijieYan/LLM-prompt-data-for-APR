### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then sorts and compares their blocks.
3. The issue arises due to the comparison of blocks where the locations are not considered. This leads to incorrect equality check when blocks are identical but located differently.
4. The function should consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them to correctly determine the equality.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks when sorting and comparing.
2. Update the block comparison logic to also check the block locations along with the dtype.name.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function takes into account the block locations in addition to dtype name when comparing the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly evaluated as unequal.
