### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes, blocks, and their contents of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
   
2. The bug arises from incorrectly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances without considering the individual block data's order, which leads to the function sometimes returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to sorting the blocks based on a combination of block type and location when comparing them. If the blocks' order is not consistent between the two `BlockManager` instances, the function might return `True` even if the blocks themselves are different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic such that it ensures the blocks are compared based on their actual content rather than just sorting and comparing based on type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for idx in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[idx]
        other_block = other_blocks[idx]

        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances directly without sorting them based on type and location. It ensures that the content of each block is compared accurately to determine equality.
