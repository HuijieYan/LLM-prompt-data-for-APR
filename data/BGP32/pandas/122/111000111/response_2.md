The bug in the `equals` function is related to comparing blocks with different locations while considering them identical. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when the expected output should be `False`. To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle blocks with different locations correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `hash` function on the block values to uniquely identify blocks, thereby taking their locations into account for comparison. This adjustment ensures that blocks with different locations are not considered identical.

By making this modification, the `equals` function should now return the correct result based on the comparison of blocks' content and locations.
