The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks without considering their locations. When two blocks are identical but located differently, the function wrongly returns True due to not considering the actual data arrangement.

To fix this bug, we need to include the comparison of block locations in the equality check. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block locations in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the equality comparison considers both block contents and their respective positions. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
