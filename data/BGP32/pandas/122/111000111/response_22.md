### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axis labels, consolidating them in place, and comparing the blocks.
- The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is due to different block locations causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.
- The bug arises from the use of block locations (`mgr_locs`) in the canonicalization process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to avoid using block locations to determine block equality in `canonicalize()` function.
- We can modify `canonicalize()` to compare blocks based on their content only.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to deeply compare blocks
    def deep_equals(block1, block2):
        return (block1.equals(block2) and
                (block1.values == block2.values).all())

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype name to compare blocks effectively
    self_blocks = defaultdict(list)
    other_blocks = defaultdict(list)
    for block in self.blocks:
        self_blocks[block.dtype.name].append(block)
    for block in other.blocks:
        other_blocks[block.dtype.name].append(block)

    for dtype_name in self_blocks:
        if dtype_name not in other_blocks or len(self_blocks[dtype_name]) != len(other_blocks[dtype_name]):
            return False
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks[dtype_name], other_blocks[dtype_name]):
            if not deep_equals(block1, block2):
                return False

    return True
```

The corrected function includes a modified comparison method `deep_equals` and a new block sorting mechanism to compare blocks based on their content effectively. This approach addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
