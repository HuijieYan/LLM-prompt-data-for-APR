### Analysis
The buggy function `equals()` compares two `BlockManager` instances, checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them in place, sorting their blocks based on type name and location, and finally comparing each block.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison of block locations is not handled correctly in the `canonicalize` function.
2. The sorting of blocks based on the location is causing incorrect comparisons.
3. The comparison logic between blocks is not handling the case where the blocks have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This leads to `equals()` incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks are not actually equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the type name for sorting blocks, ignoring the location.
2. Update the sorting of blocks to remove the consideration of locations.
3. Modify the comparison logic to handle cases where blocks may have different locations but are still equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function should now handle cases where blocks have different locations but are still considered equal.
