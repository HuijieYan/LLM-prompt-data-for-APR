### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. It compares the axes, consolidates both instances, and then compares the blocks within them. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential error locations
1. Comparison of axes.
2. Consolidation of blocks.
3. Canonicalization of block order for comparison.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where blocks have identical content but different locations properly. The comparison of axes and blocks does not consider block locations, resulting in the function incorrectly returning `True` even for instances with the same content but different locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to take into account the actual block content rather than just the block locations. We should focus on comparing the content of the blocks instead of their locations.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [(block, block.to_array()) for block in blocks]
        
    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, block_content), (oblock, oblock_content) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks) if block_content.equals(oblock_content)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first create a list of tuples containing each block and its content for both instances. Then, we compare the content of the blocks in addition to their equality. This modification ensures that the function compares the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.
