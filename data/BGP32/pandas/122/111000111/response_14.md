### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations but with the same content, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
4. The bug affects the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, specifically in how block order and locations are handled.
5. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where `equals()` incorrectly returned `True` for DataFrames with blocks swapped.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function. The comparison should focus on the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Updated Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content to ensure correct comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the `equals()` function focuses on the content of the blocks by sorting them based on their values before comparison, ensuring correct equality evaluation.
