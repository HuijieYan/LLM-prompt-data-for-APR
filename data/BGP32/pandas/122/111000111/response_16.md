### Analysing the buggy function and the GitHub issue:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating the blocks within each instance, and finally comparing the individual blocks. The issue reported on GitHub states that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which indicates a bug in the block comparison logic of the function.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the block comparison part where it sorts and compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

3. The cause of the bug arises from the sorting order of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Identical blocks with different locations may end up being sorted differently, leading to a false positive in block comparison. This mismatch results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison considers the block contents irrespective of their locations. The comparison should not rely on the internal position of the blocks but should focus on the actual data. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to reorganize the block data for comparison purposes.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), str(block.dtypes))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function now reorganizes the block data based on their values and data types for comparison. This change ensures that the comparison focuses on the content of the blocks rather than their internal structure or locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
