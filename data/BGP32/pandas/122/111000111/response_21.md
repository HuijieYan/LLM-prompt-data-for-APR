### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. It sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` ('BlockPlacement') to ensure proper comparison.
2. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` in cases where identical blocks with different locations are present.
3. The bug could be caused by the sorting mechanism on blocks not taking into consideration unconsolidated blocks with different locations.
4. A potential fix involves modifying the comparison logic to properly handle blocks with different locations.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version incorporates an additional check to ensure that the length of `self_blocks` is equal to the length of `other_blocks` before proceeding with the comparison. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
