### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
   
2. The potential error locations in the function:
   - Incorrect comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering the internal structure of the axes.
   - Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key without handling the uniqueness of blocks.
   - Comparison between blocks using the `equals` method without ensuring consistent block order.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - When comparing the axes, the function directly compares the list of axes without considering the internal structure of the axes (like names or types).
   - Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations can lead to incorrect comparisons, especially if there are unconsolidated blocks.
   - Comparing blocks directly without ensuring a consistent order can result in incorrect equality checks.

4. Fix strategy:
   - Enhance the comparison of axes by checking the attributes that uniquely identify each axis.
   - Refine the block canonicalization process to consider unique block identifiers.
   - Ensure a consistent order of blocks before comparison to maintain accuracy.

### Bug-fixed version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = [ax.to_tuple() for ax in self.axes], [ax.to_tuple() for ax in other.axes]
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1 == ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fixed version includes:
- Comparing axes using a more detailed comparison approach based on axis attributes.
- Updating the canonicalization process to consider unique block identifiers properly.
- Ensuring a consistent block order before the comparison to prevent incorrect equality checks.
