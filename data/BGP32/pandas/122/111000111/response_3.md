### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the axes, consolidates both instances, and then compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The bug description mentions that the function wrongly returns `True` when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison of block equality after sorting by `canonicalize` function may cause the bug.
2. The `canonicalize` function does not properly handle distinguishing unconsolidated blocks, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the insufficient handling of unconsolidated blocks in the `canonicalize` function. When comparing blocks after sorting, unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations can be assumed as unequal, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should prioritize handling unconsolidated blocks effectively. One solution could be to modify the sorting method or improve the way unconsolidated blocks are handled during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the comparison order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs') and not block.mgr_locs.is_consolidated():
            # Ensure unconsolidated blocks are handled properly
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values), tuple(block.mgr_locs))
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now handles unconsolidated blocks appropriately by considering both the block values and their locations before comparison. This adjustment ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.
