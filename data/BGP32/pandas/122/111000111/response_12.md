### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of `pandas/core/internals/`.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `self` and `other` objects. The issue seems to be with sorting and comparison logic for blocks.
4. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
5. To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic for blocks needs to be adjusted to consider all cases of duplicate blocks in different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We will modify the `canonicalize` function to include identifying information about block locations.
2. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.
3. By sorting blocks based on type, location, and additional information, the function will correctly identify differences.
4. We will update the comparison logic between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to handle cases where blocks are not in the same locations but are still different.

### Updated Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, 
    # name, and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block location information into the sorting key and comparing the blocks accordingly, this updated function should now correctly handle cases where blocks have similar content but are located differently within the `BlockManager` instances.
