### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The comparison involves iterating over the axes and checking if each block in one `BlockManager` is equal to the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.

2. The bug arises when identical blocks with different locations are compared because the function doesn't properly handle scenarios where blocks can have different locations in the `BlockManager`.

3. The bug trigger can be observed in the `equal` function as it doesn't account for blocks' different locations within the `BlockManager`.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the comparison code to properly handle cases where identical blocks might have different locations within the `BlockManager`.
   - One approach could be to compare blocks based on their data content instead of relying solely on the block order within the `BlockManager`.

### Correction:
```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.equals, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- The blocks are sorted based on a tuple combining the block equals function and the block values.
- This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared based on their actual data rather than just their locations.

By implementing this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the function should return the expected results in the provided test case.
