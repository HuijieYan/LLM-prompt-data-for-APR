### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks they contain. The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the function returns `True` when it should return `False` due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location
The bug is most likely in the block comparison part of the function, where it canonicalizes the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` to detect unconsolidated blocks. This comparison logic is flawed because it can mismatch blocks that are identical but have different `mgr_locs`.

### Cause of the Bug
- The buggy function sorts and compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If identical blocks have different `mgr_locs`, the function incorrectly flags them as different.
- Due to this flawed comparison, even if the blocks are identical in content, the function may return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic of the blocks. Instead of relying on `mgr_locs`, the comparison should only consider the content of the blocks.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the blocks directly without considering `mgr_locs`. Now, the function should correctly return `False` when faced with identical blocks with different locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
