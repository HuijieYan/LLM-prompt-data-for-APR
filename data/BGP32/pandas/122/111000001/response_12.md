The buggy function is trying to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality by checking the equality of their axes, consolidating the blocks in place, and then comparing the blocks in a canonicalized order.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` without checking the actual axes for equality.
2. The sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function might not produce the expected result.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly constructed. The `mgr_locs` attribute should not be accessed as an array directly, and it should be used to get the integer location of each block instead.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function in the following way:

```python
# Modify the canonicalize function in the buggy function
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

# Replace the existing canonicalize function with the modified implementation above
```

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the `canonicalize` function fixed:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now compare two `BlockManager` instances properly for equality.
