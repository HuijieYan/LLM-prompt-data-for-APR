### Analysis:
- The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects for equality.
- It first checks if the axes of both BlockManagers are the same, then consolidates the data in place using `_consolidate_inplace()` method.
- The function then proceeds to compare the blocks in the two BlockManagers based on their type (`dtype.name`) and locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`).

### Identified Bugs:
1. The equality check for axes may not be accurate due to the internal data structure.
2. The `_consolidate_inplace()` method is called on both objects unconditionally, which may modify the data.
3. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function may not work correctly.

### Cause of Bugs:
1. The bug may arise from the comparison of axes which might not accurately represent the equality between two BlockManagers.
2. Modifying the data in place with `_consolidate_inplace()` before comparison alters the BlockManager objects.
3. Sorting blocks based on `canonicalize` may not provide a definitive order for comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Implement a better comparison strategy between the axes of the two BlockManagers.
2. Avoid modifying the data in place before comparison.
3. Update the sorting logic based on `canonicalize` to ensure a proper comparison order.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Improved comparison of axes
    for self_ax, other_ax in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not self_ax.equals(other_ax):
            return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()
    
    # Sort blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
