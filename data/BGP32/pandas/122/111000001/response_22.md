### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal.
2. The function uses attributes like `self.axes`, `other.axes`, `self._consolidate_inplace()`, `other._consolidate_inplace()`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` to perform the comparison.
3. Key issue: The bug may arise due to the `canonicalize` function where it compares the blocks based on their dtype name and the manager locations. If the blocks are not consolidated properly before the comparison, the equality check may give incorrect results.

### Error Location:
- The potential error lies in the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of blocks using `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` functions are called after comparing the axes, which may result in inconsistent block structures and hence incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, consolidate the blocks before comparing them to ensure consistency. Move the calls to `_consolidate_inplace()` functions before comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

In the corrected version, the blocks are consolidated before comparison, ensuring that both `self` and `other` instances have consistent block structures for accurate equality comparison.
