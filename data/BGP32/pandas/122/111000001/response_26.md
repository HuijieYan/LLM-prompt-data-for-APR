The bug in the provided function lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs when trying to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue arises from the way the blocks are sorted before comparing their equality.

Here is a breakdown of the bug:

1. The function first checks if the number of axes in each `BlockManager` object is the same.
2. Then it compares each axis for equality using the `equals` method.
3. After that, the function consolidates the `BlockManager` objects in place.
4. Next, it checks if the number of blocks in each `BlockManager` object is the same.
5. It then tries to sort the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects based on a canonicalization function which combines the block's data type name and manager locations as a tuple.
6. Finally, it compares each block of one `BlockManager` with the corresponding block of the other `BlockManager` for equality.

The bug likely occurs during the sorting of the blocks due to the way the blocks are being compared for equality. The issue could be related to how the `canonicalize` function is defined and used to sort the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent key for sorting blocks. One way to achieve this is to convert the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple before sorting. This will ensure that the sorting is consistent even if the `mgr_locs.as_array` changes its internal representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison of blocks for equality is done consistently. This should fix the bug in the `equals` function.
