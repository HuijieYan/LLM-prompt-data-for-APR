The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the class `BlockManager` does not have a `blocks` attribute defined within it, but the function tries to access `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `BlockManager` class to include a `blocks` attribute that holds the blocks data. We can initialize this attribute in the constructor of the class.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if both BlockManager objects have the 'blocks' attribute
    if not hasattr(self, 'blocks') or not hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality of each block
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if both `self` and `other` instances of `BlockManager` have the `blocks` attribute. If not, we return `False` to handle the case where the `blocks` attribute is missing in either object.

After confirming the presence of the `blocks` attribute, we proceed with the comparison of the blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances. The rest of the function remains the same while ensuring the correctness of the comparisons between the blocks.
