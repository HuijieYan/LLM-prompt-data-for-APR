The bug in the provided function is due to the usage of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` which are not defined in the `BlockManager` class. The current implementation of the `equals` function assumes the presence of these attributes which causes the bug.

To fix the bug, you need to replace `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` with the appropriate attributes that hold the data blocks in the `BlockManager` class. Since the `BlockManager` class is designed to manage labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays, you can use `self.values` and `other.values` instead to compare the underlying data.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_values, other_values = self.values, other.values
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if not np.array_equal(self_values, other_values):
        return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version:
- We replaced `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` with `self.values` and `other.values`.
- We also used `np.array_equal` to compare the underlying data arrays directly.

This corrected version should fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
