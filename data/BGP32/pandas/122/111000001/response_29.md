The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug in the current implementation likely arises due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. 

The issue is with the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

Here, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is causing a bug because `block.mgr_locs.as_array` is a method call that should be executed first before using the `tolist()` method to convert the result to a list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly call the `as_array` method before converting it to a list. Also, it's essential to ensure that all necessary attributes and methods accessed within the function are correctly defined in the `BlockManager` class.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` is called to ensure the correct execution and conversion to a list before comparison. This should resolve the bug in the function and enable correct comparison of two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
