## Analysis:
- The buggy function is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

## Bugs in the function:
1. The buggy function `equals` has the same name as another method in the class. This causes a conflict and only the last definition is retained.
2. The function does not have complete error handling for all possible cases.
3. The function does not handle the case where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the presence of two `equals` method definitions within the same class. When the function is called, it picks up the last defined `equals` method which may not be the intended one. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect comparisons.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Rename the buggy `equals` method to something more descriptive like `block_equals`.
2. Add error handling for cases where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty to return `False` immediately.
3. Update the code to use the correct block comparison logic.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def block_equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By renaming the buggy method and adding proper error handling, the corrected version of the function ensures that the block comparison is performed correctly and error-free.
