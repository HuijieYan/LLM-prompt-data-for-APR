The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas package. This method is responsible for comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.

The potential error in this function is related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs when the `BlockManager` instances have blocks in different order but otherwise are equal.

The bug arises from the sorting of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their data type name and the manager locations. However, this sorting may cause issues if the blocks are not consolidated or if they are in a different order in the two instances being compared.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the raw values of the blocks for comparison instead of just the data type name and manager locations. This way, blocks with the same data but different order will still be considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using a function that considers values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring() 
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the raw values of the blocks instead of just the data type name and manager locations, we ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal regardless of their order. This should fix the bug in the `equals` method.
