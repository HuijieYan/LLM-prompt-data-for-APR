### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks within the two `BlockManager` objects.
4. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but the bug might be due to incorrect comparison of the blocks or their order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the provided function `equals` arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic is based on sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The bug might occur if the `mgr_locs` of the blocks are not correctly compared or sorted.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract and compare the `mgr_locs` of the blocks in a consistent way. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly to reflect their actual equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `str(block.mgr_locs)` to properly compare the `mgr_locs` of the blocks when sorting them. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly for equality.
