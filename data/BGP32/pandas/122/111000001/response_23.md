Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is named "equals" which is already a method in the BlockManager class. This can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. There is no initialization of the "blocks" attribute in the BlockManager class or within the "equals" function.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function "equals" tries to compare two instances of the BlockManager class, but it relies on the "blocks" attribute which is not properly initialized within the class. Additionally, there is a naming conflict with the existing "equals" method in the BlockManager class.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rename the buggy function "equals" to a different name to avoid conflicts.
2. Ensure that the "blocks" attribute is properly initialized and populated within the BlockManager class or pass the necessary data as arguments to the function.

Corrected Version:

```python
    def check_equal(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

In this corrected version, the function name has been changed to "check_equal" to avoid conflicts with the existing "equals" method in the BlockManager class. The "blocks" attribute is assumed to be properly initialized and populated within the class or passed as an argument to the function. The comparison logic has also been updated to use the correct blocks for comparison.
