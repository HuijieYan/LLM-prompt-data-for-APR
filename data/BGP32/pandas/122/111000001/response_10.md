The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

The potential error locations within this function could be:
1. The `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls might modify the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, affecting the comparison.
2. Sorting the blocks might affect the order of blocks and their comparison.

The cause of the bug could be that the comparison is being done on the sorted blocks without considering the actual data within them.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` method to compare the data within the blocks directly, without sorting. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the `Block` objects within the `BlockManager` objects directly without sorting them. This should ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks.
