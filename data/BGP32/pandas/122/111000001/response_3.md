Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Calling `_consolidate_inplace()` method on `self` and `other` without checking if it's necessary.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without checking if they are already consolidated.
3. Using `block.equals()` and `oblock.equals()` without checking for edge cases.

Cause of the bug:

The bug might arise due to not ensuring that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are consolidated before comparison, which could lead to discrepancies in block comparison if unconsolidated blocks are present.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `_consolidate_inplace()` method is necessary for `self` and `other` before calling it.
2. Check if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are already consolidated before sorting them.
3. Handle edge cases when using the `equals()` method for block comparison to ensure accurate results.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        # Check if consolidation is needed before proceeding
        if not self._is_consolidated():
            self._consolidate_inplace()
        if not other._is_consolidated():
            other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if blocks are already sorted to avoid unnecessary sorting
        if not self._is_blocks_sorted():
            self.sort_blocks()
        if not other._is_blocks_sorted():
            other.sort_blocks()
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.make_block_same_class(self).mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Check for edge cases and compare blocks
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

In the corrected version:
- Ensures consolidation is done only when necessary.
- Checks if blocks are already sorted to avoid extra sorting operation.
- Added handling for edge cases in block comparison.
