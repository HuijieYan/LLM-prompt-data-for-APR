The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of the pandas package. 

The bug in the provided function lies in the usage of the `.equals()` method which returns `False` on invalid comparisons. This method is used inside the `equals` function to compare blocks. The issue occurs when the function uses `block.equals(oblock)` to compare blocks. The main problem is that `oblock` may sometimes be None which results in an error due to the `equals()` method's inability to compare to `None`. 

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `oblock` is not `None` or empty before attempting to compare it. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Check if the length of blocks is not equal
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if blocks are None or empty
        if any(block is None or oblock is None for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
