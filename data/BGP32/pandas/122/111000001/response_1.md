### Analysis:
- The `BlockManager` class has a `equals` method that compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
- The `equals` method first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are of the same length. If not, it returns `False`.
- It then iterates over the axes of both `BlockManager` instances and checks if all corresponding axes are equal.
- After the axis comparison, it consolidates the internal structures of both instances in place.
- Next, it compares the number of blocks in both instances. If the counts don't match, it returns `False`.
- Lastly, it sorts the blocks in both instances based on a canonicalize function and then compares the blocks element-wise.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `_consolidate_inplace` method might cause unexpected behavior if it modifies the internal state of the `BlockManager`.
- The sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function might be problematic if the `canonicalize` function doesn't return unique identifiers for each block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` method may occur due to the sorting of blocks with the `canonicalize` function, which may not uniquely identify each block, leading to incorrect comparisons between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function returns a unique identifier for each block. One way to achieve this is by incorporating some form of unique block identifier or properties that distinguish one block from another.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.dtype.name, len_block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `id(block)` to include a unique identifier for each block. Additionally, we may need to consider other block properties if needed to make the comparison more robust.
