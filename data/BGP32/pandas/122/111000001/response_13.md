## Identified Issues:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is overriding the previously defined `equals` method.
2. The function is intended to compare two BlockManager instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks, but it has a logic issue in canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.

## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes (self axes vs. other axes) and blocks. The bug arises in the sorting of blocks before comparison. The function tries to canonicalize the blocks using a custom function, but `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` leads to an AttributeError, as `block` does not have an attribute named `mgr_locs`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify a proper way to compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Avoid the AttributeError by using a correct attribute or method to compare and sort the blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    
    ...
    """

    def _equals_blocks(self, other):
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
                
        return True

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        return self._equals_blocks(other)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `equals` function compares the axes first and then consolidates the `BlockManager` instances before comparing their blocks.
- The method `_equals_blocks` specifically compares the blocks' equality by iterating over them and using the `equals` method defined for blocks in the `Block` class.
