### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking if two BlockManager instances are equal.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the internal data structures, checks the number of blocks, and then compares the blocks to determine equality.
3. The bug may arise due to the comparison of blocks not taking into account the `Block.__eq__` method properly or due to issues with the `canonicalize` function.
4. One strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by utilizing the `equals` method of the `Block` class if available.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now extracts the class name of the block instance and the locations of its data in a list form. This ensures proper sorting and comparison of the blocks based on their characteristics. Finally, the function compares the individual blocks using their `equals` method, ensuring a correct evaluation of equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
