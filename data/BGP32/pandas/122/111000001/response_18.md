## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager instances. The function sorts the blocks based on the type name and the manager locations (`mgr_locs`) of each block before comparing them. However, the bug might occur due to the way the location information is obtained and compared.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function, specifically how it attempts to retrieve the manager locations of each block. The current implementation uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to get the manager locations as a list. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute might be missing or not correctly defined, leading to errors when trying to access it. This results in a potential `AttributeError` or incorrect comparison between blocks.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is correctly defined and accessible within each block object. Additionally, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly retrieve and compare the manager locations of blocks.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function retrieves the block type by using the `type` function and the values of the block. This ensures a more reliable comparison method for the blocks.
