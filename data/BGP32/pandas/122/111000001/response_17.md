The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The bug in this function lies in the comparison of the `blocks` attribute between two instances.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without checking if they are present in both instances.
2. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`, which may not correctly identify blocks.
3. Comparison of blocks in a zip loop without considering if the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are equal.

The cause of the bug is that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists may not align correctly based on the criteria in the `canonicalize` function, potentially resulting in false negatives when comparing the blocks for equality.

To fix this bug, one strategy is to ensure that both `self` and `other` instances have the same blocks present before comparing them. We can also modify the sorting criteria to more accurately compare the blocks. Additionally, it's essential to handle scenarios where the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not be equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)

    # Sort blocks by types and locations to ensure correct comparison
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we make sure to handle scenarios where the blocks may be missing or in different orders between the two instances. We also aim to sort the blocks based on both their data types and manager locations to provide a more accurate comparison.
