There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function `equals` is defined twice within the `BlockManager` class, which will cause conflicts.
2. The `equals` function is comparing `block` and `oblock` using the `equals` method, but it's unclear what these objects represent based on the code provided.


Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed the second declaration of the `equals` function.
- Corrected the `canonicalize` function to include the type name of the block and convert the `as_array` to a list correctly.
- Updated the comparison between `block` and `oblock` using their `equals` method. If these objects do not have an `equals` method, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted accordingly.
