### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes, consolidates the data, and then compares the blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bugs:
1. The `equals` function is redefining the `equals` method, leading to overwriting the original `equals` method defined in the class.
2. The redefined `equals` function does not take into account the existing `equals` method that is used for comparison in the class.
3. The use of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not properly compared with the existing structure when returning the result.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to redefining the `equals` method within the class without considering the implicit usage of the original `equals` method. This causes the comparison to not function properly and results in incorrect equality checks between `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the redefined `equals` function to a different name to prevent overwriting the actual `equals` method in the class.
2. Ensure that the renaming does not collide with any other existing function or method names within the class.
3. Update the comparison logic to properly compare the blocks in a consistent manner with the original `equals` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # safely rename the buggy equals method
    def check_equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `check_equals` function is introduced to properly compare `BlockManager` instances. It follows a similar logic but different name to avoid conflicts with the existing `equals` method.
