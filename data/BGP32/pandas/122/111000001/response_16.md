## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.

## Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```
The function `as_array` is called on `mgr_locs`, which seems to be mistakenly used as an attribute of `Block`. The correct attribute related to locations of blocks seems to be `locs`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `mgr_locs` with `locs` in the `canonicalize` function to access the correct attribute.
2. Update the buggy line to:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.locs)
```

## Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
