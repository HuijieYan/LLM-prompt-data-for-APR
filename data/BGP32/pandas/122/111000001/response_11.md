### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, consolidating the data blocks in-place, and then comparing the data blocks of each `BlockManager`.
2. The bug in the function occurs when trying to access the attribute `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without checking if they exist. This can lead to `AttributeError` if the blocks attribute is not present in either of the instances.
3. The bug arises from the assumption that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` will always be present, but this is not guaranteed according to the provided class documentation.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to verify the existence of `blocks` attribute in both `self` and `other` instances before proceeding with the comparison. This can be done using the `hasattr()` function to check if the attribute exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Verify the existence of 'blocks' attribute in self and other
    if not hasattr(self, 'blocks') or not hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
        return False
        
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check for the existence of the `blocks` attribute in both `self` and `other` instances before proceeding with the comparison. This helps to prevent `AttributeError` and ensures the function behaves correctly even if the `blocks` attribute is missing in one of the instances.
