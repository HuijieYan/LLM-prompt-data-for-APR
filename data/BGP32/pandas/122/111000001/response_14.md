## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances have the same length, then proceeds to compare individual axes by calling the `equals` method on each pair of axes. After that, it consolidates the blocks of both instances with `_consolidate_inplace()` method before comparing the blocks for equality.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The `_consolidate_inplace()` method is expected to be called before the comparison of blocks because it might affect the equality result if called after.
2. The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are used without being defined within the `equals` function and are supposed to be attributes of the `BlockManager` class.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function arises because the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not defined within the `equals` function, leading to a `NameError`. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace()` method should be called before comparing the blocks to ensure consistent comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Define `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` function or ensure that these attributes are accessible from the `BlockManager` class instance.
2. Call the `_consolidate_inplace()` method before comparing the blocks to ensure the comparison is based on consolidated data.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_block)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_block)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    
    def canonicalize_block(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
```

In the corrected version:
- The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are now defined correctly within the `equals` function.
- The `_consolidate_inplace()` method is called before comparing the blocks.
- Added a separate method `canonicalize_block` to be used as a key function for sorting the blocks.
