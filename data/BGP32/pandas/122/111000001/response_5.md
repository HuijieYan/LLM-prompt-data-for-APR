Potential error locations within the `equals` function:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` without ensuring that both attributes exist.
2. Accessing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without verifying that these attributes are present in the class.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `equals` function tries to access attributes `self.axes` and `other.axes` without checking if they exist, leading to potential `AttributeError`s. Similarly, the function accesses `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without verifying their existence, which could result in errors if these attributes are not defined.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.axes` and `other.axes` exist before comparing their lengths.
2. Verify the presence of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before accessing them to avoid potential errors.

Corrected `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        if not hasattr(self, 'axes') or not hasattr(other, 'axes'):
            return False
        
        self_axes = self.axes
        other_axes = other.axes
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if not hasattr(self, 'blocks') or not hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
