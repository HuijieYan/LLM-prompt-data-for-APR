The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The bug in this function arises when trying to access the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other`. The `blocks` attribute is not defined within the `BlockManager` class.

To fix this bug, we need to add `blocks` as an attribute to the `BlockManager` class and ensure it is initialized properly. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define the canonicalize function to determine the order of blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Ensure that the `blocks` attribute is properly initialized within the `BlockManager` class and contains the necessary information for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.
