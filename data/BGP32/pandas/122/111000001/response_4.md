## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. The function compares the axes of two BlockManager instances, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within each instance to check for equality.

## Bugs:
1. The function is redefining the `equals` method within the same class, which is causing the original `equals` method defined in the class to be obscured.
2. The original `equals` method is not implemented correctly, as it's comparing the blocks directly which can lead to incorrect results.
3. The function is directly calling private methods like `_consolidate_inplace`, which might cause issues if not utilized correctly.

##  Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rename the function `equals` to something different to avoid overshadowing the existing function.
2. Implement a correct comparison logic by first checking the basic attributes like axes, shapes, and then compare the actual data blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def compare_blocks(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Compare blocks
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
