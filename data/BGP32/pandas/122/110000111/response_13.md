### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in different locations but with the same content, causing the function to incorrectly return `True`.
3. The bug is explained by the fact that the comparison is based on the block's type name and manager locations, which can be different even for identical blocks due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to compare the block values instead of the block's dtype and locations, we can accurately compare blocks with the same content even if they are in different locations.
