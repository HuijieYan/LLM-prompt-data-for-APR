### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`, specifically in the sorting and comparison logic.
3. The bug might be causing `equals` to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the block comparison logic properly handles cases where block locations are different but the content is the same.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from the logic used to canonicalize and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
- The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, assuming this uniquely identifies the blocks.
- However, in cases where blocks have identical content but different locations, the current logic fails to detect them as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of relying solely on sorting based on data type and manager locations, we need to improve the block comparison mechanism.
- One approach can be to add an additional step to check block content equality after sorting based on data type and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on data type and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check block content equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a step to compare the content of blocks after sorting based on data type and manager locations, ensuring correct in-depth equality checks between corresponding blocks. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
