### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The bug reported on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" indicates that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The bug arises due to the comparison of block locations leading to false positives in determining equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle block comparison.
5. We need to update the sorting of self and other blocks based on some properties that ensure correct equivalence regardless of location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block data for comparison and equality determination.
2. Sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the modified `canonicalize` function result.
3. Compare the sorted blocks for equality.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)  # Updated to include block values instead of mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction modifies the `canonicalize` function to consider block data for canonicalization, ensuring correct comparison and equality determination. Sorting based on this modification will lead to accurate results in determining whether two `BlockManager` instances are equivalent.
