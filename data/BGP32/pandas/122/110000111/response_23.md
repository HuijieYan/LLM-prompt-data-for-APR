### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations.
3. The cause of the bug could be the order in which blocks are being compared while sorting based on type name and manager locations. This can lead to identical blocks with different locations being considered as equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is done accurately by considering the actual content of the blocks and not just their locations.

### Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual content of the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic of blocks in the `equals` function to compare the content instead of locations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block, block.values.data.tobytes())  # Compare the block values data

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual block data using the `values.data.tobytes()` method, we ensure that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than just their locations. This should fix the bug and accurately determine the equality of `BlockManager` instances.
