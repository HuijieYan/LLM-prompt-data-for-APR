### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks and compares each block individually.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly compare blocks even if they have identical content but are in different locations.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this bug where `df3.equals(df4)` is expected to return False but incorrectly returns True due to the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality checks despite the blocks having identical content.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison criteria for blocks by taking into account not just the content but also the locations of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks by location and type name for proper comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their locations and type names, we ensure that the comparison considers the unique identifier for each block, thus accurately checking for equality even with blocks in different locations.
