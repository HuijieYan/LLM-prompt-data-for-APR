### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug causes incorrect comparison results when the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### 2. Error Locations:
- Incorrect comparison of axes length.
- Inconsistency in block order comparison.
- Missing sorting of blocks.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that simply comparing the axes and blocks without considering their internal consistency will determine equality. In cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison fails due to unsorted block order.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is done in a consistent and reliable manner. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks before comparing them based on their type and locations.

### 5. Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)) + str(block.values))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the inconsistency by sorting the blocks before comparison based on their type and values, ensuring that the equality check is more robust and reliable.
