### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class checks if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, where the comparison might incorrectly return `True` when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
3. The bug leads to incorrect results when determining equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. It relies on sorting the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which might not be sufficient to distinguish blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, you should revise the block comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of relying on sorting and comparing the `mgr_locs`. This will ensure correct equality evaluation between `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, a new method `get_blocks()` is used to retrieve the blocks from `BlockManager` objects accurately. Then, the equality check is performed based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. This ensures a correct evaluation of equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
