### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function first checks the equality of the axes of both `BlockManager` instances and then compares the blocks contained within them.
3. The bug arises when comparing the `blocks` attribute of both instances. The comparison logic is flawed, causing incorrect results.
4. The bug is reported on GitHub where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type names and locations before comparison, but the bug causes incorrect orderings.


### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` method due to incorrect block comparison logic. The current implementation sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` instances by type name and locations using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting may cause blocks with the same data but different locations to be ordered differently, leading to false inequality results.

In such cases, even if the data within the blocks is the same, the method incorrectly returns `False` because of the different block orderings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal regardless of their locations. We can sort the blocks based on their contents rather than their type names and locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are now sorted based on their data values using the `values.tostring()` method. This ensures that blocks with the same data are ordered consistently, allowing for correct comparison results.
