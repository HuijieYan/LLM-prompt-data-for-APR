### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are the same between the two instances and then compares the axes. It further consolidates the blocks and compares them in a sorted manner.
2. The bug arises from the way the blocks are sorted and compared, especially due to the use of `BlockPlacement` and `dtype.name` which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for the block locations properly and ensure that blocks with the same data are correctly identified based on their content rather than their locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block data along with their locations for proper comparison.
2. Ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.
3. Use a suitable method to identify blocks with the same data for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtype, str(block.index))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances, taking into account the block data, dtype, and index to ensure accurate results.
