The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing blocks that have identical data but different locations. This bug violates the expected behavior of returning `False` in such cases. The issue on GitHub provides a clear description of this problem and an example where the function fails to produce the correct output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal. One approach could be to compare the data within each block directly instead of relying solely on block order and location.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on the block values and their locations when comparing them. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
