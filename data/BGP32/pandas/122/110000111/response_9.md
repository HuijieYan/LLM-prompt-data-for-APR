### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing the attributes and blocks of two instances of `BlockManager`. The function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrectly comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. The function should check for the equality of the blocks based on their type and location to ensure proper matching.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared correctly by their type and location. We can sort the blocks based on a combination of type and location.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the combination of type and location, we ensure that the blocks are correctly aligned for comparison and should return the correct result for equality checking between two `BlockManager` instances.
