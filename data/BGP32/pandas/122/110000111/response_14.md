### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and if all their blocks are equal.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly check for equality between the blocks, especially when they have different locations but contain the same data.

### Error Location:
The main error lies in the comparison of the blocks within the `equals()` function. The function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the blocks without considering the possibility of blocks with the same data but different locations in memory. This leads to incorrect results when determining the equality of the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks rather than their memory locations. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are still considered equal.

### Code Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by content (data) instead of location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their actual data content, rather than their memory locations. It ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are still considered equal.
