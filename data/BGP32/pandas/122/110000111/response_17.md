### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in-place, and then comparing the blocks within them.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function include the comparisons of axes, blocks, and the sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises because the method is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly. Due to the sorting mechanism used based on block type and locations, the function fails to identify them as equal blocks.
2. When comparing blocks, the method does not account for blocks that are identical but have different locations due to the sorting mechanism used.
3. This issue leads to incorrect results where the function may wrongly return `True` even in cases where the blocks are identical but located differently due to the sorting order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of sorting blocks based on their dtype and locations, it would be better to directly compare each block's contents.
2. A modification in the block comparison logic is required to ensure that blocks with identical data are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without applying the sorting logic, the corrected version of the function should appropriately handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
