### Error Location:
The bug is located in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances based on their internal attributes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison done on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. When comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, it sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, mistakenly assuming this configuration uniquely identifies the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to consider all unique attributes of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. One way to achieve this is by directly comparing the blocks themselves for equality instead of sorting based on a subset of block attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly for equality, the corrected version of the `equals` function will ensure that both `BlockManager` instances are considered equal if their blocks are identical, regardless of their internal sorting.
