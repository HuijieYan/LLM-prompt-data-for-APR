### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas package.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by verifying if their axes are equal and then comparing the blocks of data within each `BlockManager`.
3. The bug reported on GitHub states that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` even in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug arises from canonicalizing the block order based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` combination. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that identical blocks regardless of their location are considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to only compare blocks based on their data content and not their physical locations.
2. Compare the blocks directly during the final comparison step while iterating through the sorted blocks of both `BlockManagers`.
3. Ensure that the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are compared based on their content and not their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version focuses on comparing the content of the blocks rather than their locations, ensuring that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their positions within the `BlockManager`.
