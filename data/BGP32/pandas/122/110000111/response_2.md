### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The function checks if the axes of both instances are equal, then consolidates them and checks if the blocks are equal.
   
2. The potential error locations are:
   - Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
   - Using the `equals` method on axes.
   - Sorting the blocks based on their properties.
   - Comparing the sorted blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely occurs when comparing blocks that are identical but have different `mgr_locs`.
The `equals` function assumes that blocks are equal if their properties are equal, which may not be the case if the blocks have different underlying data locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of relying solely on block properties for comparison, consider comparing the actual data within the blocks.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider the data values in the blocks.
   
### Revised Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By explicitly comparing the data within the blocks instead of relying solely on their properties, this revised function can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
