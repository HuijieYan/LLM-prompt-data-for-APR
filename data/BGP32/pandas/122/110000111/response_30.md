### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two BlockManager instances by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks in each instance before comparing them.
2. The bug seems to be related to not properly handling the comparison of blocks between two instances.
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks have identical content but at different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks, not just their order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function currently compares the blocks based on their order after sorting, which can lead to a false-positive result if the blocks have the same content but at different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the block along with their type and locations for sorting.
2. Modify the comparison step to check if the blocks have equal content instead of relying solely on their order.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, with content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function handles the comparison by including the values of the blocks in the sorting and then checks if the content of the blocks are equal, ensuring a proper comparison even with blocks in different locations.
