### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises when the blocks have identical data but different locations, leading to a false positive equality result.
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this problem, where the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` for two DataFrames with swapped columns.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers content and not just locations of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function only compares blocks based on their dtype and locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include checking the actual content of the blocks, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Changed the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their data content `values.tobytes()` rather than dtype and locations.
2. This change ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
3. The function now correctly compares the blocks' content for equality, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
