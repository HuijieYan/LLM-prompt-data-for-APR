### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares `self` and `other` BlockManager objects based on their axes and block data.
2. The function checks the equality of axes first and then checks the equality of blocks by canonicalizing them and comparing each block with the corresponding block in `other`.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns True when the blocks have identical data but are placed differently. This is due to the comparison based solely on data content without considering block locations.
4. The bug can be fixed by considering both the block data and their locations in the comparison process.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the equality comparison logic in the function to consider both the data content and the locations of the blocks.
2. Before comparing blocks, attain a canonical representation for blocks by combining the data type name and the block locations.
3. Sort the blocks based on this canonical representation before comparing them with corresponding blocks in the `other` BlockManager object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... previous code remains unchanged ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected function now considers both the data content and the block locations while comparing the blocks, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
