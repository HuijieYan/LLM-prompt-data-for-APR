### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The function compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then proceeds to compare the blocks within the BlockManagers. The bug arises during the comparison of the blocks.
3. The bug causes `equals` to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical data but are located at different positions.
4. The bug can be fixed by sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function that considers both the dtype name and the manager locations to ensure consistent comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises due to inconsistent block comparison in the `equals` function. Even if the blocks have the same data, if they are in different positions (unconsolidated), the comparison may fail and return `False`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` BlockManagers using a canonicalization function that takes into consideration both the dtype name and manager locations.
2. This will ensure that blocks are compared consistently, regardless of their actual position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- Blocks are sorted based on a canonicalization function that considers both the dtype and manager locations.
- This ensures consistent comparison and fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
