### Analysis:
- The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The expected input includes `self` and `other` BlockManager instances along with their corresponding axes and blocks for comparison.
- The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine equality.
- The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, which means the comparison logic is flawed.

### Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length.
2. Comparison of axes using `equals` method.
3. Sorting of blocks for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function does not consider the locations of the identical blocks while comparing them. It only checks for identical blocks without considering if they are at different positions in the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the comparison logic to account for the locations of the blocks while sorting and comparing them.
- Ensure a comprehensive comparison of the axes and blocks considering both their content and positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes sorting the blocks based on their dtype, shape, and locations to ensure a comprehensive comparison of identical blocks in different positions within the `BlockManager`.
