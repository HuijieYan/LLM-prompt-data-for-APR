### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. It goes through a series of checks including verifying the axes, consolidating the blocks, and then comparing the blocks themselves. 

### Potential error locations

1. Comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Length comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function.
4. Comparison of individual blocks using `equals` method.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue arises when identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal by the `equals` function. This is due to the fact that the function sorts the blocks based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, without considering that the blocks themselves have different locations. Thus, the comparison at the end of the function returns `True` when it should return `False`.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include information about the block's location as well. This way, the equality check will take into account both the block type and location.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type,
    # name, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's dtype name, location, and block information while sorting. This modification ensures that blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal during the comparison.
