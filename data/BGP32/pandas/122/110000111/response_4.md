### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to occur when comparing the blocks of both instances, where the comparison fails even if the blocks are identical but located at different positions.
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering the locations of the blocks during comparison. Due to sorting blocks without considering their positions, identical blocks with different positions are not recognized as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include the block positions while sorting the blocks before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
        
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)  # Include block positions in sort key
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes the block positions in the comparison logic, ensuring that identical blocks at different positions are recognized as equal.
