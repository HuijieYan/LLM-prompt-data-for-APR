### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects, specifically comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug occurs when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` due to unconsolidated blocks being incorrectly distinguished.
4. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks based on dtype names and mgr_locs.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that block comparison is done correctly for unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect comparison of unconsolidated blocks in the `equals` function. When sorting and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the function does not handle unconsolidated blocks properly, leading to incorrect `equals` result.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly. We should include an additional check to compare and sort unconsolidated blocks based on the actual block data. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are correctly compared without causing the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if not isinstance(block, (IntBlock, ObjectBlock)):
            return block.values   # For unconsolidated blocks, compare the actual values
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check in the `canonicalize` function to compare unconsolidated blocks based on their actual values when needed. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves correctly when comparing `BlockManager` objects.
