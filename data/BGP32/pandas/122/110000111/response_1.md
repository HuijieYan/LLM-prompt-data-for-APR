### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
- The bug is related to how the blocks are compared and sorted, which leads to incorrect results when the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Error Location:
- The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function where it only considers the dtype name and `mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks. This can lead to wrong results if blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function only takes into account the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to consider the actual block data. This leads to cases where blocks with the same data but different locations are mistakenly identified as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to include the block data itself when comparing and sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the equality check considers all aspects of the block, including the actual data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order taking into account block data as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block data, dtype name, and `mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are now treated as equal.
