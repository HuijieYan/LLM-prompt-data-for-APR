### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager`. It first checks if the axes of the two instances match, then consolidates them and compares the blocks within each instance.
   
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of blocks within the instances. The blocks are being sorted based on a canonicalization function that combines the dtype name and manager locations. However, the comparison of the blocks is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

3. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` even when the blocks within the two instances have different locations.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should compare the actual data within the blocks rather than using sorting based on dtype name and manager locations.

### Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))

def get_blocks(self):
    return [block for block in self.blocks]

# Assuming the Block class has an 'equals' method to compare block data
# Implement the 'Block' class if necessary to support the 'equals' method

```

This corrected version compares the actual block data within each instance of `BlockManager` rather than sorting and comparing based on dtype name and manager locations. It ensures that the `equals` function returns `False` when the blocks have different contents.
