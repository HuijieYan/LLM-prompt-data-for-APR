### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function checks the equality of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, then consolidates both instances and compares the number of blocks inside them.
3. The buggy part is the comparison of actual blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where it should consider the different locations of identical blocks.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the block locations.

### Bug Cause:
By not taking into account the different block locations, the function wrongly returns `True` when the blocks have the same values but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic for blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to account for different locations of identical blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks including mgr_locs for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now includes a comparison of `mgr_locs` for each block, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not falsely marked as equal.
