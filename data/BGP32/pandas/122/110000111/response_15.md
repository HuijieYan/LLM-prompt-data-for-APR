### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals()` function incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks have identical data but different locations.
4. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks using the `block.equals()` method while sorting the blocks based on data type and `mgr_locs`.

### Error Location:
1. The error lies in the `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.
2. The sorting is based on the combination of data type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `canonicalize()` function does not consider the possibility of two blocks having identical data with different locations. Sorting blocks based on data type and `mgr_locs` can lead to incorrect comparison results when the data is the same but the locations differ.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in the `canonicalize()` function to consider the block data itself for comparison instead of relying solely on data type and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Check if blocks have the same content
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Compare blocks content directly
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the content of the blocks, we can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. This corrected version considers the block values for comparison instead of sorting blocks based on data type and locations.
