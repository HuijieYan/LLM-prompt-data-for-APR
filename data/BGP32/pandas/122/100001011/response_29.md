### Issue Analysis:
- The `equals` function is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects which have identical blocks with different locations. Due to sorting the blocks based on their type and location, the function might incorrectly return `True` when comparing similar data structures.
- The GitHub issue provides an example where the function should return `False` but incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Location:
- The issue lies in the sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on their types and locations before the comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because during the comparison of `BlockManager` objects, the function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization method that combines the block's type and location. This can lead to the same data being compared incorrectly due to different block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are compared based on their content, rather than their type and location. This change should prevent the incorrect comparison of similar data structures that have different block locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, rather than type and location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the comparison part to directly compare the blocks' content instead of sorting them based on type and location before comparison. This change ensures that blocks are compared solely based on their content.
- This corrected version should fix the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
