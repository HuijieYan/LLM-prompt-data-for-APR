### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two objects for equality based on various conditions. However, the bug arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` where there is a discrepancy in their iterated order, causing incorrect equality results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of blocks using `sorted()` in the `canonicalize` function.
2. The zip operation in the final return statement that may lead to wrong block comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the fact that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are being sorted differently due to the `canonicalize` function. This leads to incorrect pairing of blocks for comparison, resulting in inaccurate equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted in the same order, so the correct blocks are compared during the final equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # check for block equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version ensures that the blocks in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on the same criteria (the dtype name) using the `canonicalize` function. This alignment in sorting order guarantees that the correct blocks are paired for comparison, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
