### Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because it incorrectly identifies identical blocks with different locations as equal, leading to an incorrect return value of `True` when it should be `False`. This behavior violates the expectation of the user, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function that utilizes `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` as the sorting key. This sorting approach fails to consider different block locations for identical blocks, resulting in wrongly identifying them as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks while considering their actual data content rather than just their dtype and locations. This can be achieved by sorting based on the block's actual data content to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not falsely identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_data(block):
        return block.get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_data)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their actual data content by using the `get_values()` method to retrieve the block's data, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal.
