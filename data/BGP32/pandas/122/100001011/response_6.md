### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The function compares the axes of `self` and `other` BlockManagers but fails to consider the actual values within the axes.
2. During block comparison, the function sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function, which does not accurately reflect equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function's comparison logic. It primarily focuses on the axes and block order but fails to dive deep into the actual data comparison within the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality evaluations.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug:
1. Enhance the axis comparison to check the values within the axes.
2. Revise the block comparison method to directly compare the blocks' data contents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check block equality based on block data
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def equal_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    return all(equal_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- Axis comparison considers the actual values within the axes.
- Block comparison directly compares the block values for equality.

By applying these changes, the function should now properly handle comparisons and correctly evaluate equality, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
