### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to check if two BlockManager instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the comparison of blocks more accurately. Instead of relying solely on dtype and mgr_locs, we should consider additional criteria to distinguish blocks effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            len(block),
            block.shape,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding additional criteria such as the size and shape of the block to the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure a more accurate comparison of blocks. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub by properly handling identical blocks with different locations.
