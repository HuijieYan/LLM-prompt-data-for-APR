### Bug Analysis:
Based on the provided GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations," the buggy function in `managers.py` is causing incorrect behavior in the `equals()` method for `DataFrame` objects. The function is erroneously returning `True` when comparing `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) but doesn't handle the case where blocks are in different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function doesn't take into account the block location information, leading to misordering when sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `equals` function doesn't properly consider the block locations when comparing the `BlockManager` objects. As a result, even when the blocks in `self` and `other` are the same but with different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider both the block contents and their respective locations. This involves updating the `canonicalize` function to incorporate information about the block locations, ensuring blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly distinguished.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block contents and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated version of the function, the comparison now considers both the block contents and their locations, ensuring that the function correctly handles cases where blocks are identical but located differently within the `BlockManager` objects.
