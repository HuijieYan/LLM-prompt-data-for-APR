### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Specifically, when comparing the blocks between two instances, the function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. However, the bug arises when two identical blocks exist but have different locations. This results in the comparison incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for cases where two blocks are identical but have different locations. Instead of solely relying on sorting based on data type and locations, the equality check should ensure that each block is properly compared without considering the location.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not compare_blocks(block1, block2):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version introduces a new function `compare_blocks` that directly compares individual blocks without the need for sorting based on locations. It iterates through each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and verifies their equality. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`, ensuring a proper comparison regardless of block locations.
