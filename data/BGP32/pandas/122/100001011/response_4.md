### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is primarily comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`). The bug seems to arise from the comparison of the order of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their block type and manager locations.

### Identified Issue:
1. The bug occurs when the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on block type and manager locations. This sorting criterion might cause inconsistent results due to the way it handles unconsolidated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function's implementation causes it to incorrectly determine equality between two `BlockManager` objects. It particularly struggles with distinguishing unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with blocks in different locations but the same content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the sorting mechanism based on block type and manager locations needs to be modified to ensure that even unconsolidated blocks can be correctly distinguished. It might be necessary to introduce a more robust way of comparing blocks that considers the actual content rather than just their position.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function compares the blocks directly for equality, thereby bypassing the problematic sorting mechanism. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected behavior for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
