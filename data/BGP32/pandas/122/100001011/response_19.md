### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, there seems to be an issue in the comparison logic where the function incorrectly identifies two `BlockManager` objects as equal even if they have identical blocks but located in different positions.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the section where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes. This sorting might lead to incorrectly identifying different blocks as equal when they are not.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the runtime values provided, the bug arises from the sorting of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Since the sorting is based only on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, blocks with the same content in different positions are mistakenly considered equal. This behavior contradicts the expected output and the GitHub issue description where the comparison should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to consider the block content and position while comparing two `BlockManager` objects. Instead of just sorting and comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can compare blocks content-wise to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects for equality without altering the order or sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This modification should resolve the issue stated in the GitHub problem description.
