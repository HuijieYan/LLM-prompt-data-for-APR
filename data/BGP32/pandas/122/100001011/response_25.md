### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the fact that the function sorts the data blocks based on their `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`, which might lead to wrongly returning `True` when encountering identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the comparison process to handle cases where identical blocks with different locations exist. Instead of solely relying on sorting by `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`, we should evaluate the equality of blocks considering other factors as well.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that accommodates situations where identical blocks with different locations need to be distinguished:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_slice(),  # Consider mgr_locs as a slice
            block.values.tolist()  # Include block values for more accurate comparison
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we introduce additional factors like `block.values` to the `canonicalize` function to make block comparisons more accurate. This modification should address the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
