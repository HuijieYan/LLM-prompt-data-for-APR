### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by their axes, blocks, and block order. The issue described on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison of axes `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting of blocks `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. Comparison of individual blocks in the sorted lists.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the way the blocks are sorted based on block type and manager locations, as described in the GitHub issue. Since the comparison doesn't account for the different locations of identical blocks, it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider the actual block contents rather than the block locations. This will ensure that blocks are considered equal regardless of their internal details.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now combines the block type and contents to ensure that blocks are sorted based on their actual values. This modification will address the issue described on GitHub and return the correct result when comparing identical blocks.
