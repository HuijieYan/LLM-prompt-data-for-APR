### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to inaccurately return `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations. The issue arises from not properly accounting for block locations in the comparison.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` function might be faulty.
2. The sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function might not be handling block locations correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks based only on the dtype name without considering the block locations. This can lead to blocks being compared incorrectly, resulting in a false `True` return even when the blocks are not equivalent but have different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, the comparison of blocks should include the block locations so that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. Updating the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function to consider both dtype name and block locations should fix the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, `canonicalize` function considers both the dtype name and block locations to ensure accurate comparison of blocks. By sorting blocks based on both criteria, the function will correctly identify when blocks are not equivalent due to different locations, resolving the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
