### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks within them. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function returns `True` for inputs that are expected to be `False` due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified Issue
The issue lies in the sorting logic used to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The `canonicalize` function currently uses `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` as the key to sort the blocks. However, this method fails to differentiate between blocks that are identical but with different locations.

### Bug Cause
The `canonicalize` function does not consider the content of the block but only relies on the type name and the locations. This leads to incorrect comparison results when blocks are equal but in different locations.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the sorting key should encapsulate more information about the content of the blocks to ensure that equivalent blocks in different locations are not considered equal. You should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values within the blocks for a comprehensive comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `block.values` to differentiate between blocks based on their actual content. This should prevent equal blocks in different locations from being incorrectly considered as equal.
