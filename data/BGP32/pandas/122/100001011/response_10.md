### Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises because the function doesn't handle the case when blocks have identical data but different locations, leading to a false comparison result.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which creates a key tuple using the block's data type name and locations. This causes the function to incorrectly identify blocks with identical data but different locations as different blocks, leading to an incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data within the blocks for comparison and not just the data type name and locations. By comparing the actual block data instead, we can correctly identify blocks with identical data but different locations as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now compares the block data locations directly, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified. This fix resolves the issue of `DataFrame.equals` wrongly returning `True` in such cases.
