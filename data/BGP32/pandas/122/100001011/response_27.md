### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by sorting their blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises when the `mgr_locs` are different for blocks that contain identical data, leading to a false positive result in the comparison, incorrectly returning `True`.

The bug is causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False` in scenarios where blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for cases where the data is the same but the locations differ. One approach could be to check for block data equality using a different comparison technique that considers the data itself rather than the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            tuple(block.get_values()),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison key for block sorting now combines the `dtype.name` and the block contents (values), ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equivalent. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
