### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The bug might be related to the sorting and comparing of blocks in the function.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the potential bug location of block sorting in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the content within the blocks rather than just their order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks for sorting.
2. Use a different approach for comparing the blocks based on their actual data rather than just ordering.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not just order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the sorting mechanism to consider the content of the blocks, we can ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than just their order. This should resolve the issue where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly identified as equal.
