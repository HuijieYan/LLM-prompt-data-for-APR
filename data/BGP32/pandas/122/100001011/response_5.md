### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by first checking the equality of the axes, then consolidating the blocks, and finally, comparing the blocks themselves. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block dtype name and `mgr_locs` to order the blocks for comparison. The bug likely causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal erroneously, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Description
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function only considers the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` of the blocks when sorting them. If the blocks have identical data but different locations (as in the GitHub issue example), they will be incorrectly marked as equal due to the faulty comparison logic in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function to differentiate between identical blocks based on their actual content rather than just their dtype name and locations. One way to achieve this is by comparing the data within the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the block sorting logic by directly comparing the blocks using their `equals` method. This way, identical blocks with different locations will not be incorrectly marked as equal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
