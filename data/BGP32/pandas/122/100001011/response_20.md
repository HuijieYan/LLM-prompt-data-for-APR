### Analysis
- The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The function compares the axes of both objects, then checks the blocks for equality.
- The bug seems to be related to the block comparison logic, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
- The function's error might be due to the order in which the blocks are compared.

### Bug Cause
1. The `equals` method compares the blocks by sorting them based on a canonical representation that combines the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of the block.
2. If two identical blocks have different locations (mgr_locs), the `equals` method does not account for this difference and falsely considers them equal because it sorts the blocks based on a canonical key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider the actual contents of the blocks rather than their canonical representation. Sorting based on a tuple of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` can lead to misleading equality checks.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare blocks without sorting them based on a canonical key. This adjustment should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
