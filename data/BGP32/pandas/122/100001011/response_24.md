### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue lies in the comparison logic of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function fails to correctly identify blocks with the same content but different locations as different, resulting in a false positive equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the sorting mechanism used within the function based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function compares blocks by their type name and manager locations. If blocks have the same content but different locations, they will be erroneously considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison criteria to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. This can be achieved by comparing the block content directly instead of relying on the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, we ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as not equal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
