### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as equal, leading to an incorrect `True` return instead of `False`.
3. The bug arises due to the comparison not taking into account the actual locations of the blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include the block locations in the comparison process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations.
2. Modify the block comparison to consider both block equality and block locations.
3. Ensure that the comparison logic reflects the correct implementation as per the GitHub issue description.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function includes block locations in the comparison. The block comparison now not only checks for block equality but also confirms that the block locations match. This adjustment addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by ensuring that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
