### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to check for equality between two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns True when the blocks have identical content but different locations. The function's logic needs to be modified to address this discrepancy.

### Error Location
The bug is likely caused by the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks in the function. The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs is the potential error location as it might not correctly handle identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the current sorting method used in the `canonicalize` function does not take into account the scenario where two blocks have the same content but different locations. This leads to incorrect results where the function incorrectly returns True for blocks that are not actually equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the sorting mechanism needs to be revised in a way that considers the content equality of blocks rather than solely relying on their dtype and locations for comparison. By modifying the sorting criteria to prioritize the actual content of the blocks, the function can accurately determine equality even when the blocks have different locations.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_block(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.astype(str)  # sort based on string representation of locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_block)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `sort_block` function sorts the blocks based on their locations converted to strings. This ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are considered equal during comparison. By updating the sorting criteria, the function can now accurately determine and return the correct equality status between two BlockManager objects.
