### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue described on GitHub points out that the function wrongly returns `True` when the blocks are identical but have different locations. This occurs because the function currently compares the blocks based on the order in memory, leading to a mismatch in expected outputs.

#### Identified Error Locations:
- The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs.
- Comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks using the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function does not consider the same blocks at different locations as equal. The comparison based on the dtype name and mgr_locs is not sufficient to identify whether the blocks are equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison mechanism to consider the content of the blocks rather than their order or memory location. We can compare the blocks element-wise to ensure that the content matches irrespective of their location.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_and_compare_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtpe.name, block.values.to_numpy().tobytes()))

    self_sorted_blocks = sort_and_compare_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_sorted_blocks = sort_and_compare_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) 
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and the values they contain. Then it compares the sorted blocks element-wise to ensure that the content of the blocks is identical, regardless of the location or order in memory. This approach fixes the bug reported on GitHub.
