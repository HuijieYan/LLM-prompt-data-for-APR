### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then if their blocks are equal.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, particularly in the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function which combines the block's dtype and mgr_locs.
3. The failed test case (Case 1) demonstrates that the function incorrectly returns `True` even for different blocks (e.g., different dtype and mgr_locs).
4. To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for blocks to properly detect differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Override the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just dtype and mgr_locs.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, the corrected version ensures that blocks are properly checked for equality without relying solely on their dtype and mgr_locs. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub.
