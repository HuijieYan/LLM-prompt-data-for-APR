### Bug Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects. The bug appears to stem from the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. The current implementation relies on sorting and comparing the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but this approach doesn't consider the case where identical blocks have different `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` even when the `BlockManager` objects have identical blocks with different locations due to the flawed comparison approach.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the block comparison logic to handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations. One way to achieve this is by comparing the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks directly involves calling the `equals` method on each block pair without sorting or relying on `mgr_locs`. This approach should handle cases where identical blocks have different locations and ensure accurate comparisons between `BlockManager` objects.
