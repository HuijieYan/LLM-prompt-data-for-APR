### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be incorrect.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might lead to incorrect comparisons.
3. The `canonicalize` function's implementation could be causing issues.

### Explanation of the bug:
In the provided case, when comparing the `self` and `other` BlockManagers, it is expected that they should not be equal due to different locations of the blocks. However, the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` in this case, leading to the mismatch.

The bug arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function that compares the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. Since the mgr_locs (locations) are different in `self` and `other` despite having the same dtype name, the comparison yields incorrect results, causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic based on the BlockManagers' blocks. Since the problem lies in the comparison of the blocks' locations, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the dtype name for sorting, ignoring mgr_locs. By doing so, we will ensure that the comparison focuses on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations, resolving the issue.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for sorting, we ensure that blocks with the same dtype are correctly compared, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
