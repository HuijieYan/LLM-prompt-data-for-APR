### Analysis:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug causing the function to return incorrect results lies in the comparison of blocks where different locations in memory can be considered equivalent. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation, as blocks with the same content but different locations are mistakenly viewed as unequal.

### Issues:
1. The `canonicalize` function uses the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method which can lead to different memory locations being treated as different when they actually hold the same content.
2. The block comparison in the final return statement does not account for blocks that are equal in content but may have different memory locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug emerges because the canonicalization of blocks is misleading as it attempts to differentiate blocks by their memory locations rather than focusing solely on their content.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on their content instead of their memory locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's `dtype.name` without memory-specific information. Additionally, the final equality check should rely on comparing the block content directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update to canonicalize blocks based on dtype.name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks based on content equality
    return all(
        block.to_array().equals(oblock.to_array()) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction focuses on comparing the block's content by converting them to arrays and examining their equality directly. Additionally, the canonicalization function now solely considers the block's `dtype.name` for comparison rather than including memory-specific information.
