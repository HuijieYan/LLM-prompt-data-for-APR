### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the bug occurs due to the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting can cause identical blocks with different locations to appear as unequal, leading to incorrect results.

### Issue Cause:
1. The comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function can incorrectly identify blocks as not equal, even if they have the same data.
2. Sorting blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` ignores the actual block values, leading to incorrect results.
3. The comparison logic does not handle cases where blocks have the same data but are placed in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of sorting blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, compare the actual values in the blocks.
2. Adjust the comparison logic to handle cases where blocks with the same data are placed in different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual block values instead of sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub.
