### Analysis
The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` unexpectedly when it should return `False`. This discrepancy suggests a bug in the implementation of the `equals` method.

From the runtime values and types provided, it appears that the function is correctly comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. However, when comparing the blocks, a sorting operation is performed based on the block attributes `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue might stem from a discrepancy in the block attributes between the two instances.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug occurs due to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. If any of the block attributes differ between the `self` and `other` instances, the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` could mix up the blocks creating a false positive result.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison considers the actual content of the blocks, not just their attributes. One approach is to compare the values of the blocks directly instead of relying solely on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes for sorting.

Let's correct the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the block values as a binary representation stored in a bytes-like object. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than specific block attributes. This modification should fix the bug and make the `equals` method more robust for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
