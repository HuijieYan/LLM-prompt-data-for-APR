### Analysis
- The `equals()` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
- The function first checks if the number of axes in both instances is the same. If not, it returns `False`.
- Then it proceeds to check if each axis in both instances is equal.
- After that, it consolidates both instances in place.
- Next, it compares the number of blocks in both instances, returning `False` if they are different.
- The function then sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations to compare them.
- Finally, it compares each block in one instance with the corresponding block in the other instance to decide on equality.

### Bug
- The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks. The function fails to properly compare the blocks due to incorrect handling of the sorting logic.
- The sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function is flawed, leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

### Fix
To fix this bug and avoid the failing test:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly create tuples for sorting based on type name and manager locations.
2. Ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly after sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function and ensuring proper sorting, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now be able to handle the comparison of blocks accurately.
