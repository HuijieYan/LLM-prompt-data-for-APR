### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The error message shows that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. 

Looking at the runtime values, we can see that the block order is not correctly considered when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The sorting of blocks by `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the types and positions of blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect sorting of blocks by the `canonicalize` function, which fails to differentiate between blocks of different types and positions during comparison. This results in the function returning `True` instead of `False` for non-equal DataFrames.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should consider both the type name and the position of the block to ensure correct sorting. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include block position information in the tuple used for sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, position, and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block.start)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding the block position to the tuple used for sorting in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks are correctly ordered during comparison, leading to the correct determination of equality.
