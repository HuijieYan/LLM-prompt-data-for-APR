### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks for equality. The error message indicates that the test failed when asserting `df1.equals(df2) is False`. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances to determine equality.

### Error
The error occurs due to a mismatch in the blocks order of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances. The sorting based on `canonicalize` function is not effective as it sorts the blocks differently than expected, causing the equality check to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to correct the sorting logic for blocks based on the `canonicalize` function. We should ensure that the sorting criteria for blocks are consistent and preserve the order for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a key function for sorting blocks
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (str(block.get_values()), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the blocks will be sorted keeping the order consistent for comparison, fixing the bug where the test was failing.
