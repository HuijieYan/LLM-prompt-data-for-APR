### Analysis
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the `axes`, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the blocks for equality based on their dtype names and manager locations.

The failing test is asserting that two DataFrames are not equal, which triggers the comparison of the underlying BlockManager objects.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The blocks are being sorted and compared based on a canonicalization function that involves the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not directly comparable as a list, which leads to incorrect sorting and comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is effectively compared for equality. One way to achieve this is to convert the `mgr_locs` to a form that can be directly compared, such as a tuple. This will enable correct sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are done correctly. This should address the bug and make the comparison function work as expected.
