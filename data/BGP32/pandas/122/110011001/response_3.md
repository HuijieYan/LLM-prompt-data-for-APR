### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The failing test is trying to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is False.
- The error message indicates that `assert True is False` failed, meaning the function is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
- At runtime, the values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not correctly compared, leading to the incorrect return value of the `equals` method.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` method. The issue might be related to incorrect sorting or comparison of the block elements.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly comparing the blocks stored in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The method tries to sort the blocks based on type name and manager locations to compare them effectively. However, there seems to be an issue in this comparison logic, leading to the incorrect result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are correctly compared. This can be achieved by properly sorting and comparing the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block[1].dtype.name, block[1].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(enumerate(self.blocks), key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(enumerate(other.blocks), key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        s_block[1].equals(o_block[1]) for s_block, o_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We enumerate both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` during sorting to keep track of their original positions.
- We sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function.
- We correctly compare the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method of each block.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
