### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on various attributes and blocks. The failing test is trying to assert that two different DataFrames are not equal, but it erroneously claims they are equal. This discrepancy indicates a bug in the implementation of the `equals` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of block values in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The sorting mechanism based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` generates incorrect results, leading to the mismatch. This mismatch causes the function to return `True` even when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks. Instead of relying solely on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we should compare the blocks based on their data content. This approach will ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly, reflecting the actual data values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on data content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Using this corrected version, the comparison of blocks will be based on their data, ensuring that the blocks are sorted correctly for comparison. This fix should address the bug and make the `equals` function provide the expected outcomes for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
