### Analysis
- The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing because `True` is being compared to `False`.
- The runtime values show that the axis labels and blocks are in a different order between the two `BlockManager` instances, causing the equality check to fail.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the order of axes or blocks in the `BlockManager` instances differ. 
- The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not consider the block order and only sorts based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
- The function assumes that the axes and blocks are in the same order for both instances, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the axes and blocks are correctly aligned before performing the equality check.
- One approach is to first sort the axes based on their labels and sort the blocks accordingly.
- By ordering the axes and blocks consistently, the equality check can accurately compare the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = sorted(self.axes, key=lambda x: x.name), sorted(other.axes, key=lambda x: x.name)
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After applying this fix, the `equals` function should properly compare the `BlockManager` instances' axes and blocks for equality, resolving the failing test case.
