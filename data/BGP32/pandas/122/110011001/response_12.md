### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The method first checks if the axes of both instances are equal, then consolidates the blocks within both instances and finally compares each block.
   
2. The failing test provides DataFrames with columns swapped as input, and the assertion is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.

3. From the runtime values, it's evident that the function is correctly comparing the axes, but the comparison of the blocks is flawed. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is not handling the case where columns are swapped in the input DataFrames.

4. To fix this bug, the comparison should be based on the label names instead of the order of block sorting.

### Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # fixed equals method
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare blocks based on labels
        self_block_labels = {block.label for block in self}
        other_block_labels = {block.label for block in other}
        
        if self_block_labels != other_block_labels:
            return False

        for label in self_block_labels:
            self_block = self.get_block(label)
            other_block = other.get_block(label)
            if self_block is None or other_block is None:
                return False
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their labels, ensuring that columns are correctly matched for equality comparison. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
