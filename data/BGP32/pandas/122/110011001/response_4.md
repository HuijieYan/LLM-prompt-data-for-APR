### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the axes of the two BlockManagers.
2. Sorting blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.
3. Comparing each block between the two BlockManagers.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, the buggy function implementation currently returns True despite the DataFrames having different values. This bug suggests that the current comparison logic is incorrect.

1. The function initially compares the axes of the two BlockManagers. If the axes' lengths do not match, it returns False, but it does not consider the actual values within the axes.

2. The function then proceeds to consolidate the BlockManagers inplace, sort the blocks based on dtype and location, and compare each block between the BlockManagers. However, the bug might be in the way it is comparing the blocks.

3. The bug might lie in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks. If the function does not correctly represent the uniqueness of each block, the comparison logic might fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for comparing axes to ensure that not only the length but also the actual values are considered for equality.
2. Verify the `canonicalize` function to guarantee that it uniquely identifies each block.
3. Check the block comparison logic to confirm that it correctly determines equality between corresponding blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or self_axes != other_axes:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the axes are fully compared, the blocks are uniquely sorted, and the block values are compared correctly for equality.
