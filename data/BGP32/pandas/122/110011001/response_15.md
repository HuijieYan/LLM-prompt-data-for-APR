### Bug Fix Analysis

The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) incorrectly. The issue is due to a comparison between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The bug stems from an incorrect implementation of comparing the blocks based on their data type and locations.

1. In the failing test case provided:
   - `df1` contains columns ['a', 'b'] with values [1, 2] and ['s', 'd'] respectively.
   - `df2` contains columns ['a', 'b'] with values ['s', 'd'] and [1, 2] respectively.
   - The `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` check is failing.

2. The bug occurs in the `equals` function:
   - The function compares the axes of the two BlockManagers (`self` and `other`), but then incorrectly compares the blocks themselves without considering the data type and locations within the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them. This sorting will ensure that blocks with the same data but in different orders are correctly handled.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Function to canonicalize block for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort blocks based on data type and locations for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks in both BlockManagers before comparison, we ensure that the blocks are correctly matched irrespective of their order, fixing the bug.
