### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by how the function is comparing the block data structures in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on both the dtype name and the manager locations (`mgr_locs`) to compare them. However, the buggy comparison method might not handle comparing the blocks correctly, resulting in the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison logic for the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is correct. One potential fix could involve iterating through each block in both lists and comparing them appropriately based on their data and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))

    return all(
        block_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version iterates through the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` while comparing them properly using a separate `block_equal` function. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and manager locations before comparison.
