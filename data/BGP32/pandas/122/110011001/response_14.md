### Analysis
The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they contain equal values. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances. The error message indicates that the comparison is not returning the correct result because it is comparing the wrong values within the blocks.

### Issues
1. The function sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function, but there seems to be an issue with how it extracts the properties for comparison.
2. The equality comparison of the blocks is not correctly implemented.

### Bug Cause
The `equals` function fails to properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. It relies on sorting the blocks based on the block type name and manager locations but does not effectively utilize this information in the equality check. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the subsequent failure of the test.

### Fix Strategy
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the necessary properties for comparing the blocks.
2. Modify the comparison inside the `equals` function to properly check the equality of the sorted blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the function should now compare the blocks correctly and pass the failing test.
