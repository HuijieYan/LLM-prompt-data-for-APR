### Issue Analysis
The failing test is checking the equality of two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, by using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing the two DataFrames.

Looking at the buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class, we can see that it first checks the equality of axes between `self` and `other`. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it compares the lengths of blocks in `self` and `other`, if they are not equal, it also returns `False`.

Next, it tries to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, and then compares each block pair in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method of the block class.

### Bug Explanation
The bug might be in the block sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The comparison of blocks is dependent on this sorting.

In the case provided, the sorting logic considers both dtype and block locations to determine order, which might not be suitable for comparing DataFrames. The block order might not be consistent between different DataFrames.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the block sorting does not affect the comparison of DataFrames with different block orders. One way to fix this issue is to remove the custom block sorting based on dtype and locations and instead compare blocks directly without sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the custom block sorting to compare blocks directly without any order consideration. This change should ensure that the equality check between DataFrames works as expected.
