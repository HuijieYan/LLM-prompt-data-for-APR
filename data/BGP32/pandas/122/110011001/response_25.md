### Analysis
The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The function first compares the axes of the two instances and then proceeds to compare the blocks. The issue seems to be with the comparison of blocks since the bug is causing the test case to fail when comparing two DataFrames that have different values but the same axes.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is in how it is canonicalizing and sorting the blocks for comparison. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on data type and memory locations, which leads to incorrect comparisons when the values are different but the blocks have the same data type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their actual values rather than sorting based on dtype and memory locations. We can achieve this by comparing the underlying block values directly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the block values using the `equals` method of the underlying values. It should now pass the failing test case provided.
