### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returned `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail. This suggests that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.

In the buggy implementation of the `equals` function:
1. It checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not equal, but it doesn't check if their content is the same.
2. It consolidates both `self` and `other` using `_consolidate_inplace`, which may modify the internal structure of the `BlockManager` instances.
3. It sorts the blocks inside the `BlockManager` instances based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` which might not be a reliable way to compare the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected, we need to:
1. Compare the contents of `self_axes` and `other_axes` instead of just their lengths.
2. Avoid modifying the internal state of `self` and `other` by removing `_consolidate_inplace` calls.
3. Improve the comparison of blocks in `self` and `other` by comparing them directly instead of sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Check if axes are equal based on content
    if not all((ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))):
        return False
    
    # Avoid altering internal state
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    return all((block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)))
```

By implementing these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
