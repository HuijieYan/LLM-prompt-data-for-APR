### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the DataFrames are considered equal when they should not be.

Looking at the provided runtime values, we see that the input DataFrames have different values in their columns, but the comparison operation in the `equals` function wrongly judges them to be equal due to an issue in sorting and comparing the block values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly evaluates the equality of the underlying block values in the DataFrames, instead of wrongly considering them equal based on their block order. We should update the sorting mechanism for the blocks, ensuring that the comparison is accurate irrespective of the order of blocks.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Ensure block values are equal by iterating through the sorted blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this modification, the function should now accurately determine the equality of the blocks within the DataFrames, providing the correct comparison.
