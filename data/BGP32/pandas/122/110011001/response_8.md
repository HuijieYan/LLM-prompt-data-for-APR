### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances based on their axes and blocks. The error message suggests that the test to check inequality between two DataFrames fails, which implies there is a bug in the comparison logic of the `equals` function.

### Issue
1. The bug lies in the comparison of the block contents. The current implementation of sorting blocks using the `canonicalize` function is flawed, as the block dtype is directly compared and may not accurately represent the content of the block. The issue is likely arising from a mix-up between block datatypes, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be revised to take into account the actual content rather than just the dtype. Implementing a more robust method of comparing block contents should lead to correct inequality checks.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    return self_blocks == other_blocks

def get_blocks(self):
    return [b.values for b in self.blocks]
```

By modifying the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their dtypes, we can accurately determine if two instances are equal. Moreover, we introduce the `get_blocks` method to extract block values for comparison. This approach should resolve the bug and ensure correct inequality checks.
