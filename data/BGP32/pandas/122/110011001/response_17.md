### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class implementation is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks of each instance, and then compares the blocks in a canonicalized order.

The error message from the failing test indicates that when comparing two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`), the `equals` function returns `True` when it should return `False`. This discrepancy occurs due to incorrectly sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing the blocks. When sorting the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`, the sorting criteria are flawed, resulting in a mismatch between the blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function to ensure correct comparisons between blocks. Instead of sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can sort by `dtype.name` alone. This will simplify the sorting process and eliminate the potential mismatch between blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` only, the corrected version of the function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
