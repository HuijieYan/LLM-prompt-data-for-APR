### Explanation:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates them, checks the number of blocks, and finally compares each block individually.

2. The error occurs because the `canonicalize` function is intended to create a tuple for each block consisting of the block's dtype name and their location as a list. However, the implementation is incorrect and leads to an error.

3. The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when comparing two dataframes for equality. The generated output shows that the actual assertion compares `True is False`, which is clearly incorrect, leading to the failure.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to properly create tuples for each block before comparing them.

### Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method with the fixed `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects should be done correctly, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
