The bug arises from the comparison of DataFrames with columns in different orders. The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two objects. However, when comparing the blocks, it incorrectly assumes that the order of the blocks' columns is the same in both objects.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider the order of columns in the DataFrame blocks. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on the column order before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.dtype.name,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the column order before comparison, the corrected `equals` method should now properly handle DataFrames with columns in different orders. This fix should address the failing test scenario provided.
