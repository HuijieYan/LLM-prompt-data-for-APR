### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class assumes that the input block structures (`self.blocks` and `other.blocks`) are sorted in a specific order based on data type and manager locations. However, the actual comparison of blocks in the function relies on this incorrect assumption, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to not rely on sorting the blocks based on data type and manager locations. Instead, we should directly compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` without assuming an order.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Testing
After applying this fix, re-running the failing test case provided should result in the assertion passing as `df1` and `df2` are indeed not equal based on the data provided in the test case.
