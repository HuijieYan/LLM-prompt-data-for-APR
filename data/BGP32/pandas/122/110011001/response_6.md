### Analysis
The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the function is erroneously comparing the `self.blocks` with `other.blocks` without considering the order of the blocks. This leads to the comparison failing even when the block contents are the same but in a different order. The error message highlights that the assertion fails because the comparison of `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function compares the lengths of the axes of `self` and `other`. If they are not equal, it immediately returns `False`.
2. It then iterates over the axes of `self` and `other` and tries to compare them. If any axis is not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates both `self` and `other` in place.
4. Next, it compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
5. The function then proceeds to sort the blocks in `self` and `other` based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
6. Finally, it compares each block in sorted order between `self` and `other`. If any of the blocks are not equal, it will return `False`.

The bug arises in the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function, which does not consider the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of the blocks is also considered during the comparison. One way to achieve this is to generate a tuple of block content along with the block index during sorting to maintain the order.

### Updated Implementation
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block data, to preserve ordering
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.to_tuple(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted((block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks), key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted((block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks), key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the function will preserve the order of the blocks during sorting and comparison, ensuring that the comparison is correct even if the order of blocks differs between the compared instances.
