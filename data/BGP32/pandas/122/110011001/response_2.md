### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The failing test case involves creating two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' but having values in different order and then checking for equality. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing unexpected results for the equality comparison.

### Bug location
The bug seems to be located in the block comparison part of the `equals` function, particularly when comparing the blocks for equality.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `equals` method first compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, which seems to be working fine based on the provided runtime values.
2. Next, it consolidates the blocks in both instances in-place.
3. The comparison of the number of blocks is correct but sorting and comparing the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` seems to be problematic. The sorting of blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` might not be providing the correct order for comparison, leading to incorrect results.
4. The bug might be causing a mismatch in the comparison of corresponding blocks in both `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances are correctly aligned for comparison.
2. Instead of relying solely on type name and manager locations, we can consider an alternative approach to ensure a proper comparison of blocks.
   
### Bug-fixed code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both BlockManagers
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on their values directly
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
In the fixed code, we compare the blocks directly based on their values, ensuring a correct comparison. This change should address the bug and make the `equals` function work properly.
