### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) using the order of their blocks without considering the actual data within the blocks. The issue occurs when sorting blocks based on type and location within the manager, leading to incorrect comparisons between the DataFrames.

### Bug Location
The main issue is within the sorting logic using `canonicalize` and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on block equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks for equality rather than sorting blocks and comparing them based on their type and location in the manager.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks matches
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks themselves
    return all(
        True if block.equals(oblock) else False
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` using the `equals` method's return value for equality. This approach ensures that the data within the blocks is compared accurately.
