### Analysis
The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The error message suggests that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This indicates that the existing implementation of the `equals` function is not working correctly.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the issue might lie in how the blocks are being compared. The function compares the blocks by sorting them based on their data type and manager locations, which might be causing the incorrect equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issue and fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to ensure that the comparisons between the blocks are done correctly. We should focus on how the blocks are being sorted and compared.

One potential solution could be to compare the blocks directly without sorting them beforehand. By iterating over the blocks of each `BlockManager` and comparing them one by one, we can ensure a more accurate equality check.

### Corrected Version
Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances, we ensure a more accurate equality check that should fix the failing test.
