### Potential Error Location
1. The comparison of axes between `self` and `other` might be causing the issue.
2. Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple of block attributes could lead to discrepancies in ordering.

### Bug Explanation
The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It first checks if the number of axes is equal, then compares each axis, consolidates the blocks, and finally compares the blocks themselves. The error arises from the comparison of axes and the subsequent comparison of blocks. The test case fails because the function incorrectly determines that `df1` is equal to `df2`.

The comparison fails due to the order of blocks when performing the comparison step, as the blocks from the two DataFrames are not in the same order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is consistent before comparing them. We can achieve this by explicitly sorting the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on certain attributes that uniquely identify the blocks and hence guarantee a consistent order for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on unique identifiers like the block dtype and mgr_locs, we ensure that the comparison is consistent and accurate. This correction should resolve the issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.
