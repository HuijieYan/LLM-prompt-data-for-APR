### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) that have columns with different types. The function currently checks if the axes are equal and if the blocks are equal without considering the data types of the blocks. This results in a situation where the data type of the blocks is not taken into account for comparison, leading to an incorrect result when comparing DataFrames with columns of different types.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for the data types of the blocks in the comparison. We should modify the comparison logic to consider the data type in addition to the existing comparison of axes and blocks.

### Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now considers the type of the block in addition to dtype and mgr_locs to ensure correct comparison between DataFrames. The comparison logic has been updated to include this information, addressing the bug in the original code.
