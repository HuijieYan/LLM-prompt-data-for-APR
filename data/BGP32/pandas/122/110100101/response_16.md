The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The code is attempting to canonicalize blocks by sorting them based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not accessible directly through the `block` object, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to access the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle this correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now directly accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object, resolving the AttributeError. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
