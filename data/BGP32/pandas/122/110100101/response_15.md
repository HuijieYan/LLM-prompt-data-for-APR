The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison logic when checking block equality between two `BlockManager` instances. 

The main issue is identified in the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function currently does not provide a unique and consistent representation of blocks for proper sorting.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to generate a representation that includes both the dtype name and the actual data values from the block, ensuring a unique and consistent sorting order for the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._ref_locs, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._ref_locs, block.values))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted and compared based on the block values along with the reference locations. It should pass the failing test case provided.
