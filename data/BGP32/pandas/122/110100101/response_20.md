The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two instances and then compares the blocks within each instance.

The bug in the function is causing incorrect results in the comparison due to the sorting mechanism used for blocks based on the `canonicalize` function. The sorting of blocks is dependent on the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block, which may not accurately represent the order of data within the blocks. This sorting issue leads to incorrect equality checks.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the actual block data for comparison, rather than relying solely on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. By comparing the actual block values, we can ensure a proper comparison of the contents of each block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the block instances without relying on sorting based on `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within each block, leading to accurate equality checks.

With this fix, the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided.
