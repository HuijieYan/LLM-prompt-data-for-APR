### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The bug arises from the comparison not correctly handling the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks based on their types and manager locations, but the sorting does not guarantee a correct comparison of the individual blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of individual blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is accurate. We should modify the comparison logic to consider each block individually, ensuring that corresponding blocks from both instances are compared correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares each block within the `BlockManager` instances correctly, ensuring that the comparison is accurate. This fix addresses the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test case.
