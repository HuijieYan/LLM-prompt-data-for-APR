The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison logic for `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The bug causes the function to return `False` incorrectly even when the two BlockManagers have the same data stored differently. 

To fix this bug, we need to compare the data within the blocks of the BlockManagers rather than comparing the blocks directly. We can iterate over the blocks in both BlockManagers and check if the data within each block is equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block data instead of blocks directly
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the block values in each block of both BlockManagers to check for equality, which will correctly handle cases where the data is the same but stored differently within the blocks.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
