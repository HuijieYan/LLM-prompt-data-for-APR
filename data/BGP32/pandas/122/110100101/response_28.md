The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison logic used to check if two instances are equal. The current implementation fails to handle the comparison between the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The function should compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. The comparison should consider both the order and content of the axes and blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two instances.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison is done correctly for both axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
