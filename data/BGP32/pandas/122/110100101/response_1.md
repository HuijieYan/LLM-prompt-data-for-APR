The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic does not consider the case where the blocks are not sorted in the same order, leading to false negatives even when the content of the blocks is equivalent.

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison of blocks to consider the order of the blocks as well. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by sorting the blocks based on a canonical key that includes both the data type name and the manager locations. This ensures that the order of the blocks is taken into account during the comparison.

Once this corrected version of the `equals` function is applied, it should pass the failing test provided.
