The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different orders due to sorting discrepancies. When comparing blocks for equality, the function sorts the blocks based on a key generated by `canonicalize` function, which considers the dtype name and location indices of the blocks. If a block's dtype name is not unique across different blocks, sorting based on dtype name could lead to misleading results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include more unique identifiers for each block. One approach could be to add the block's type and size in addition to dtype name and mgr_locs. This will ensure that blocks are ordered consistently based on more specific criteria.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining type, dtype name,
    # mgr_locs and size
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values.size)
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's type and size in the sorting criteria, the blocks will be ordered more reliably and accurately, ensuring correct comparison in the `equals` function.
