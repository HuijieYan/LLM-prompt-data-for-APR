The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to compare blocks in the correct order due to a missing key function for sorting blocks. This leads to incorrect comparisons and a failed test case.

To fix the bug:
1. Define a key function `block_key` that returns a tuple of block type name and locations.
2. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances using the `block_key`.
3. Compare the sorted blocks to check for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `block_key` function and sorting the blocks based on it, the corrected function ensures that blocks are compared in the correct order. This should now pass the failing test case provided.
