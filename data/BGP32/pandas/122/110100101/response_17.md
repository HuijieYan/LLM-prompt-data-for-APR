## Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises when comparing the blocks because the blocks are sorted differently for `self` and `other` instances, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bugs:
1. The blocks are sorted differently for `self` and `other` instances in the `equals` function, causing incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks based on a consistent key to ensure the comparison is accurate.

## Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

The corrected code ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a consistent key for both `self` and `other` instances, allowing for accurate comparison during the `equals` function execution. This fix should address the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
