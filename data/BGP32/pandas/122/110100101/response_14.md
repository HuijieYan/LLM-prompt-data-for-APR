The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of the dtype name and the locations of the blocks. However, the comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` is flawed because `block` and `oblock` are of different types (`IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we compare blocks of the same type before calling the `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks of the same type are compared before calling the `equals` method. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
