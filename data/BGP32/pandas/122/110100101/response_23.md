### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances for equality. However, the bug arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks due to a sorting issue.

### Potential Error Location
The bug arises in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. The current implementation of `canonicalize` does not handle `block.mgr_locs` properly, resulting in incorrect sorting.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different value types in opposite positions. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` since the dataframes are different. However, due to the bug in the sorting logic of blocks, the function incorrectly returns `True` indicating equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly consider the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks for sorting. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are distinguished correctly, resolving the sorting issue.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, blocking information and mgr_locs to properly sort blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block[0])
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs.block[0]` information, we ensure that unconsolidated blocks are properly sorted, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
