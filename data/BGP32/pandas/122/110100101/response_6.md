The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug appears to be related to the way blocks are being sorted and compared. 

The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` and `other` BlockManager objects are equal. Then it compares each pair of axes using `equals` method. After that, it consolidates both BlockManagers and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both objects based on a canonical function `canonicalize` and compares each pair of blocks.

The issue seems to occur during the sorting and comparison of blocks, as the sorting function `canonicalize` does not handle the comparison properly, causing incorrect equality checks.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. We should also update the comparison logic to handle the sorting correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version fixes the issue by sorting the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` converted to string. It ensures that the comparison between blocks is performed correctly, addressing the bug in the `equals` function.
