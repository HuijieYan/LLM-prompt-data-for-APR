### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` because it is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic does not account for the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`, which causes the comparison to fail even if the blocks contain the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to consider the order of the blocks. We can sort the blocks based on a combination of the block's data type name and the `mgr_locs` property, which uniquely identifies the block, thus ensuring a consistent comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this sorting logic before comparing the blocks, we ensure that the blocks are compared consistently regardless of their order within the `BlockManager`. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()`.
