## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The function first compares the length of axes, then checks if all axes are equal, consolidates both instances, sorts the blocks, and then compares each block for equality.
3. The bug seems to be in the sorting of blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function which combines dtype name and mgr_locs.
4. The bug likely arises from the `canonicalize` function not producing consistent or meaningful results for comparisons.

## Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises due to inconsistency in sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. If the `canonicalize` function does not consistently differentiate between blocks, the sorting can lead to incorrect equality checks.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we can redefine the `canonicalize` function to provide a robust and consistent basis for sorting blocks. This might involve only considering `dtype.name` or finding more meaningful criteria for comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, by sorting blocks directly based on block type
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: type(block).__name__)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: type(block).__name__)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks based on their type names directly, we eliminate the need for a custom `canonicalize` function that may produce inconsistent results. This should resolve the bug and make the equality check more reliable.
