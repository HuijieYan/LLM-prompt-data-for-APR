The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided above. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the blocks in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.

The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks not being in the correct order, resulting in the `equals` function returning False when it should return True.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order before comparing them. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks before comparing
    def get_block_sort_key(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their location and values before comparison, we ensure that the blocks are in the correct order and the `equals` function will now return the correct result.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
