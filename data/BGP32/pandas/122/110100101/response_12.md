### Fixing the bug

The bug in the `equals()` function arises from comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects with different values but the same type. The blocks need to be sorted and compared based on their type and locations. One possible strategy to fix this bug is to implement a custom sorting function for the blocks based on type and location before comparing them.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function implements a custom sorting function `canonicalize()` that sorts the blocks based on their type and locations. This ensures that blocks with the same type but different values are correctly compared.
