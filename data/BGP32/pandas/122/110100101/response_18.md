### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function is comparing two BlockManager objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises from the fact that when comparing the blocks of the two BlockManagers, the code is not taking into account the internal structure of the blocks (dtype and mgr_locs). As a result, even when the shapes and axes match, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks includes the dtype and mgr_locs of each block. This will ensure a more comprehensive check of the BlockManager objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, ensuring a more accurate comparison between the two BlockManager objects.
