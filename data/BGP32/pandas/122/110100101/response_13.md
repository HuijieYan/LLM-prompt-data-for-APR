The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparing them. The issue arises from the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function.

The `mgr_locs` attribute is an instance of `BlockPlacement`, and calling `as_array` directly on it causes the bug. This is because `mgr_locs` is not directly a NumPy array, but rather a property that returns a NumPy array, and thus should not have a direct `as_array` method call.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute within the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
# Corrected version of the equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.locs.tolist())  # Fixed to access 'locs' instead of 'as_array'

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method properly handles the `mgr_locs` attribute and now accesses the `locs` attribute to retrieve the list of locations. This fix should address the bug and make the `equals` method work correctly.

After applying this correction, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass without any issues.
