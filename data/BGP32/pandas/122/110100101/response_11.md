The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison logic between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is based on the sorted order of the blocks, but the sorting criteria is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is caused by the flawed sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function used to compare blocks. The comparison is based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, where `block.dtype.name` represents the data type of the block and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` represents the block's location. This criteria does not guarantee correct comparison of blocks in the context of DataFrame equality.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of using the data type and block location for comparison, a better approach would be to directly compare the block values themselves. This ensures that the content of the blocks is being compared accurately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will accurately compare the block values of the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring correct equality checks.
