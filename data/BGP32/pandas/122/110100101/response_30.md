The bug in the `equals` function arises from a logic error while comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function fails to correctly compare the blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects due to incorrect sorting of the blocks. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted correctly before comparing them. The comparison should be based on the block's data type and `mgr_locs` for each block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize and sort blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly before the comparison. This should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
