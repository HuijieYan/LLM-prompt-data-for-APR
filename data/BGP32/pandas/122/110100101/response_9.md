## Bug Analysis
The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates the blocks within each object and compares them. However, the bug arises from the block comparison logic, specifically in how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks.

The `canonicalize` function aims to sort the blocks based on their data types and locations. However, the bug lies in the comparison of `mgr_locs` in the `block` objects. The `as_array` attribute is not correctly transformed into a list, leading to comparison issues.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `Block` objects is correctly processed before comparison. By transforming `mgr_locs` into a list of values, we can compare the blocks effectively based on their data types and locations.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly compare the `Block` objects based on their data types and locations, resolving the bug described.
