### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, as it sorts the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations but doesn't handle the comparison of different block types properly. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` for cases where the blocks are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to update the comparison logic for blocks. We should compare blocks of the same type and manager locations before declaring the `BlockManager` objects as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
      
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block) for block in other.blocks]

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        dtype1, mgr_locs1, block1 = self_blocks[i]
        dtype2, mgr_locs2, block2 = other_blocks[i]

        if dtype1 != dtype2 or mgr_locs1 != mgr_locs2 or not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
          
    return True
```

This corrected version compares blocks by their dtype, manager locations, and actual equality. It iterates through each pair of blocks in the same order and checks if they are equal or not. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`.
