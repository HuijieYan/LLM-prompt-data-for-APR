The bug in the equals function is likely due to the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on the output of the canonicalize() function. The bug occurs because the canonicalize block function is not handling the representation and comparison of the blocks correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize() function to handle the comparison of blocks properly. We should incorporate both the dtype and the mgr_locs of the blocks to distinguish between different types of blocks accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.__repr__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks based on both their types and mgr_locs, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
