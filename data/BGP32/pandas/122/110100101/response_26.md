## Fixing the buggy function

### Error Location:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` fails because it doesn't handle the cases where the blocks within the `BlockManager` may not be ordered in the same way between `self` and `other`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to compare the blocks directly without considering the order in which they are stored. This can lead to false negatives when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with differently ordered blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first sort the blocks within both `self` and `other` based on a consistent sorting key before comparing them. This way, we ensure that we are comparing equivalent blocks even if their order differs between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks within self and other based on a consistent key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if the sorted blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a consistent key (`canonicalize` function), we ensure that the comparison between `self` and `other` is accurate even when the block order differs. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
