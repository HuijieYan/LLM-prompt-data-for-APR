## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The function tries to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but this comparison method is not reliable due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data types.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we can change the block comparison logic to directly check for block equality. We will iterate through blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManager instances and compare them one by one.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare each block in `self` and `other` BlockManager instances for equality using the `equals` method.

With this fix, the expected test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
