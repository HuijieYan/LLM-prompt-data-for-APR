### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the function currently has a bug where it incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. As a result, when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the function fails to correctly determine equality leading to the test failure.

The error message indicates that the function returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2`. This likely occurs due to an incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects by sorting them and then comparing each block individually. This will ensure that the function accurately determines the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects will be done correctly, resolving the bug and ensuring that the function returns the expected result for the failing test.
