### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. The problem seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the DataFrames.

Looking at the relevant runtime values and types of variables, we can see that the issue might be in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. It seems that the dtype names are not being properly compared in the sorting process.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the sorting in the `canonicalize` function not taking into account the dtype name correctly. As a result, the blocks might not be sorted in the expected order for comparison in the `equals` method.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the dtype name in a way that ensures proper sorting of the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function uses the type name of the block for sorting, which should solve the issue with incorrect comparison in the `equals` method.
