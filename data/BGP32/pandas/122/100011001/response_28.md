### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`). The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
2. The function compares the axes of both `BlockManager` instances, then attempts to consolidate them in place, and finally compares the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
3. In the provided runtime values, the input parameters `self_axes` and `other_axes` contain the same values according to the test case, indicating that the axes are the same. However, the error message shows that the comparison evaluates to `True`, which is incorrect.
4. The issue lies in how the function is comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`. Since the blocks are not ordered correctly for comparison, the function is failing to identify the difference between the two `BlockManager` instances.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted properly before comparing them.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix ensures that the blocks within each `BlockManager` are sorted correctly before comparison. By sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations, the function can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
