### Error Analysis
The error message is asserting that `True` is equal to `False`, which indicates that the `equals()` method is not returning the correct result. The function is comparing two BlockManager objects containing multiple blocks, and the comparison is done based on the blocks' characteristics after sorting them.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the way the blocks are compared in the `equals()` method. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks by their dtype and mgr_locs, but the comparison of blocks using the `equals()` method may not provide the desired result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison logic between blocks is correct and that comparing the original objects provides the desired result. We need to compare the DataFrame values directly rather than relying on the internal block sorting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the DataFrames directly, not the blocks
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

By directly calling the `equals()` method on the values of the DataFrames, we can ensure that the correct comparison is made without relying on internal block sorting. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected result.
