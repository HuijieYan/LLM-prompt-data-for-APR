### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The function first compares the `axes` of both `BlockManager` objects and then compares the `blocks`. However, in the comparison of the `blocks`, it sorts them based on a `canonicalize` function that considers the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting operation can lead to an incorrect comparison of blocks if the data is misaligned.

In the failing test case, the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have the same column names but their data values are swapped. This causes the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` to be in a different order in `df1` compared to `df2`. When sorting the blocks by `canonicalize` function, the function incorrectly matches blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which results in the incorrect equality check between the `BlockManager` objects.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting of the blocks to ensure that we compare the blocks in the correct order regardless of their `dtype.name` or `mgr_locs`. One approach is to compare blocks based on their index positions rather than their properties. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their index positions before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # sort blocks based on their index positions
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: self_blocks.index(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: other_blocks.index(block))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their index positions, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly without considering unnecessary properties that could lead to misalignment.
