### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by a mismatch between the expected behavior of the `equals` function and the actual comparison being performed. The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal.

Looking at the code, the function compares the axes of two objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks within those objects. In this case, the issue seems to be with the comparison of blocks. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the actual comparison of the blocks is flawed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly. Specifically, we need to compare the data within the blocks to properly determine if two DataFrames are equal or not.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we compare the values within the blocks using `block.values.equals(oblock.values)` to ensure that the data within the blocks is properly compared for equality. This change should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test case.
