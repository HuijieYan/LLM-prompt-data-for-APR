The bug in the function `equals()` is related to comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other`. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails. This indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing the two DataFrames.

Analysis of the runtime values and types of variables shows that the issue arises from sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` properties of each block to determine the order. In this specific case, the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` in `self.blocks` are in the wrong order compared to `other.blocks`, leading to a false equality.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for different block types before sorting the blocks. We can update the `canonicalize` function to include the block type as part of the comparison criteria to correctly match blocks of the same type. Additionally, we need to ensure that the block types are aligned correctly for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block type in the comparison key of the `canonicalize` function to properly sort and match blocks during the DataFrame equality check.
