### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the way the `canonicalize` function is defined and used to sort the blocks in `self` and `other` before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function currently relies on accessing attributes (`dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`) of the `block` object. However, the `block` object in this context belongs to the `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock` type, and these types do not have attributes named `dtype` or `mgr_locs`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access these attributes, causing the function to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it properly extracts the necessary information from the block objects (`IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock`). We can use the `dtype` attribute directly without trying to access `name` and potentially create a tuple with block information that can be used to compare blocks correctly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After making this change, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple with the block type and values, allowing for correct comparison and sorting of blocks in the `equals` function. This correction should resolve the AttributeError and make the function operate as intended.
