### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and the contents of those blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects fails even though they contain different values. This failure occurs because the function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different data types.

In the runtime values provided, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes. However, in the case where different types of blocks exist, like an `IntBlock` and an `ObjectBlock`, the comparison based on only these attributes would lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and the specific block values for each type. By incorporating the block values in the comparison, we can ensure that blocks with different data types but similar values are not mistakenly detected as unequal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
        # Add more cases as needed for different block types

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values along with dtype and locations, we can achieve correct comparison of blocks even in cases with different data types. This modification ensures that the `equals` function correctly identifies whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
