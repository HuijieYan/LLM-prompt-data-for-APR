### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The function is sorting the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs` which represents the location of the block in the block manager. However, when comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, it is not handling the comparison correctly for the given input data types.

The error message indicates that the comparison of the two `DataFrame` objects fails, as expected. This is because the function is not handling the comparison correctly when the data types of columns do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process in the `equals` function to handle different data types properly. Instead of relying solely on the dtype and `mgr_locs`, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Ensure the blocks have the same type and data
    for i, (self_block, other_block) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        # Compare the data within the blocks
        if not self_block.values.equals(other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing the actual data within the blocks using the `equals` method of the block values, we ensure that the two `BlockManager` objects are considered equal only if their contents match. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
