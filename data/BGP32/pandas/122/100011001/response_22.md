### Bug Analysis:
The error message suggests that the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are incorrectly identified as equal when they are actually not equal. This mismatch leads to the failing test. The buggy function compares the DataFrames based on the blocks they contain, which results in the wrong comparison due to the order of the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `equals` first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`) and then proceeds to compare the blocks within those managers.
2. The issue arises when the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` properties. This sorting does not consider the actual data values within the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. The bug causes DataFrames with the same data but in different block arrangements to be wrongly identified as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual data values within the blocks rather than just the block attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.values.equals(other_block.values) for block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

This corrected version directly compares the data values within the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances. This modification ensures that the DataFrames are compared based on their actual data content, which should resolve the issue causing the failing test.
