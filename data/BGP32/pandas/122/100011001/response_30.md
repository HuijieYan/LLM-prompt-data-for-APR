### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` method when comparing two DataFrame objects. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`. This discrepancy in the comparison results from the mismatch between the corresponding values in the DataFrames.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks of the DataFrames before comparison. The `canonicalize` function combines the block's data type name and locations for ordering. If the blocks have different data types or locations in `df1` and `df2`, even though the actual data values are the same, they will be incorrectly deemed unequal.

### Bug Understanding
In the failing test case, the input DataFrame `df1` contains integer values in column 'a' and string values in column 'b'. Meanwhile, `df2` swaps the columns, making 'a' contain string values and 'b' integers. Since the sorting done by the `canonicalize` function depends on block data type and locations, the DataFrames are not equal according to the sorting criteria, leading to the erroneous result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process to focus on the data values of the blocks rather than their data type or location. By directly comparing the block values row-wise, we can ensure that DataFrames with differently ordered columns but the same data values are considered equal.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block.values, oblock.values, check_dtype=False)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function now compares the block values directly using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal`. The `check_dtype=False` argument ensures that the data type discrepancy between the blocks is ignored during the comparison. This modification allows for a correct comparison of the DataFrames' values without being affected by the ordering of columns or block locations.
