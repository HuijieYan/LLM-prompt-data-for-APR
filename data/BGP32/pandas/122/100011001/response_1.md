### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the `equals` function inappropriately assumes that the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects should be the same for two `BlockManager` instances to be considered equal. However, in the test case provided, the order of the blocks is different between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances, leading to the false assertion that the two `DataFrame` instances are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function so that it checks for the equality of blocks without assuming a specific order. We can achieve this by comparing all blocks between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances to identify any discrepancies in the block content.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_types = {block.dtype.name for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_types = {block.dtype.name for block in other.blocks}

    if self_block_types != other_block_types:
        return False

    self_block_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in other.blocks}

    return all(
        self_block_dict[type_].equals(other_block_dict[type_]) for type_ in self_block_types
    )
```

By comparing the block types and then specific blocks within each type, the corrected function can identify differences in content between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances without being affected by the block order.
