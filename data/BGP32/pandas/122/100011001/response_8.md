### Analysis:
The buggy function is aiming to check if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` for two dataframes that are not equal.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function where it's using `block.dtype.name` for comparison. For the provided test case, this results in comparing "int64" with "object" which leads to incorrect sorting and thus incorrect comparison.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `canonicalize` function is based on both dtype and values. One way to achieve this is by comparing the values instead of just the dtype name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and values to uniquely identify blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the values and mgr_locs as suggested in the corrected version, the function should now be able to correctly determine the equality of two BlockManagers.
