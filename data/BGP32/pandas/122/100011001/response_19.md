### Bug Analysis
The error message is asserting that `True is False`, and it provides the representation of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`). The failing test is checking `df1.equals(df2)` and expects it to be `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` hold the data blocks of the DataFrame. These blocks have different values in the corresponding positions, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the content of the blocks correctly. One way to achieve this is to compare the data within the blocks directly instead of relying on the `equals` method, which might not handle the comparison well in this scenario.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not np.array_equal(self_blocks[i].get_values(), other_blocks[i].get_values()):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare the block data directly using `np.array_equal` to ensure that the content of the blocks is compared accurately, which should resolve the bug.
