### Bug Explanation
The error message during the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True is False`, which implies that the `equals` function is not correctly determining that the two DataFrames are not equal.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples are incorrectly ordered, leading to the comparison issues. The blocks within `self` and `other` are sorted by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` properties, which can lead to a mismatch if the order is not consistent.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within `self` and `other` DataFrames are sorted consistently before comparison. By removing the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we can directly compare the blocks as they are.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare blocks without sorting
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, we ensure a consistent comparison order and resolve the bug.
