### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails because it assumes that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are ordered in the same way for comparison. However, in the failing test case, the blocks are ordered differently between `df1` and `df2`, leading to a false assertion of inequality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared in a consistent order. We can sort the blocks based on a unique identifier before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize_block` function generates a unique identifier for each block based on its dtype and memory address. This ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison, fixing the bug.
