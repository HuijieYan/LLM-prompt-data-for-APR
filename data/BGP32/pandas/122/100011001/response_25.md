### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the values of the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The method is only checking if the lengths of the axes and blocks are matching, but it's not comparing the actual data within the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. We can achieve this by comparing the values within the blocks element-wise.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the values inside the blocks are the same
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not b1.equals(b2):
            return False

    return True
```

By this correction, the function now loops through the blocks of the DataFrames and checks if the values within the blocks are equal, returning `True` if they match and `False` otherwise. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
