### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, followed by checking if the blocks within the managers are equal. The bug arises when comparing the blocks because the original code does not properly handle cases where the blocks are in different order or have different data types.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the sorting and comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function combines the type name and manager locations of a block, assuming this information is sufficient to identify and sort the blocks correctly. However, this assumption may not hold if there are unconsolidated blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Cause:
The error message and runtime values indicate that the comparison between the blocks fails, causing the function to return `True` instead of `False`. This is likely due to the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function not accurately distinguishing between blocks that have different content but similar type names and manager locations.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers their actual content and arrangement. Instead of solely relying on the block type name and manager locations, we should design a more robust comparison method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks and directly compares each block in the same order. By doing this, the function will correctly identify differences between the blocks and return `False` when blocks are not equal.
