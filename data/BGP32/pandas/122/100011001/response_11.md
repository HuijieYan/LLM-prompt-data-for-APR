### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects representing DataFrames. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two DataFrames failed, leading to an assertion error. The error message specifically shows that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`, which is expected.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it can be seen that the issue lies in how the blocks of the DataFrames are being sorted and compared. The current implementation compares the blocks based on their data types and memory locations, which is causing the wrong comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to improve the comparison logic for the blocks of the DataFrames. Instead of sorting and comparing based on data types and memory locations, we should compare the actual data values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_items()
    other_blocks = other.get_items()

    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

In the corrected version, we extract the DataFrames from the blocks using `get_items()` method and then compare the DataFrames directly using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` function. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data values of the DataFrames rather than their types or memory locations.
