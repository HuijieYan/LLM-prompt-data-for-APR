### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch between the expected behavior of comparing two DataFrames and the way the function is implemented. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` which means the function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.

The issue can be traced back to the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The function first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are the same, which is correct. Then, it consolidates the blocks within each DataFrame and sorts them based on their type and location. However, the comparison within the `canonicalize` function neglects the fact that the column values are not being compared correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison step in the `equals` function to compare the actual values in the blocks of the DataFrames, not just their types and locations. This can be done by extending the `canonicalize` function to include the values from each block.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, values, and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.as_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the actual values from each block by calling the `block.as_tuple()` method. This ensures that the comparison of DataFrames includes the values in the blocks, making the equality check more accurate.
