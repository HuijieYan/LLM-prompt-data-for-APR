### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` where the columns 'a' and 'b' have different types in each DataFrame. The error message indicates that `df1` equals `df2` is evaluated to `True`, which is incorrect.

The buggy function first compares the axes of the two DataFrames by checking if they have the same length and if each axis is equal. Then, it proceeds to compare the blocks of the DataFrames based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks because the comparison is based on the dtype, which may not be sufficient to determine equality when the data types are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to include the actual values of the blocks in addition to the dtype and mgr_locs. We should consider the block values in the equality comparison to ensure that DataFrames with different data types but the same values are not erroneously marked as unequal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        if block.shape != oblock.shape:
            return False
        for i, b in enumerate(block.blocks):
            if not b.values.equals(oblock.blocks[i].values):
                return False
        return True

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `compare_blocks` function compares the values within each block to ensure that DataFrames with different data types but the same values are treated as equal. This modification fixes the bug and the function should now correctly compare two DataFrames for equality.
