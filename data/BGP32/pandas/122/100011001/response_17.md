### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning True when it should be returning False. This behavior is unexpected and causes the assertion to fail.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the issue might be related to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. However, the data types of the blocks are not being considered correctly, which leads to incorrect sorting and comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect sorting of blocks based on data type and manager locations within the `canonicalize` function. The function is currently only using the data type name to sort the blocks, but it should also consider the manager locations to handle cases where unconsolidated blocks might have the same data type.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also include manager locations as part of the sorting key. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are differentiated properly during sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the manager locations in the sorting key, the corrected function should now properly handle cases where unconsolidated blocks have the same data type, preventing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
