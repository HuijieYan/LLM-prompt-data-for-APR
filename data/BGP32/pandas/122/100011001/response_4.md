### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function due to the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have columns of different types and different values. The function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The function compares the axes (column names and indexes) of the two DataFrames. It then sorts the blocks within the DataFrames by creating a canonical form based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which represents the block's location.

In the failing test case, `df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})` has columns "a" with integers and "b" with strings, while `df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})` has the columns in opposite order with different types. The function fails to properly handle the comparison between different data types within the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the data type of each block when comparing them. This modification will ensure that the blocks are compared based on their data type and values, preventing the function from incorrectly returning `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype)  # Include block values and dtype for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now takes into account both the values and the data type of each block when comparing the DataFrames, ensuring that it correctly identifies differences between blocks with different data types.
