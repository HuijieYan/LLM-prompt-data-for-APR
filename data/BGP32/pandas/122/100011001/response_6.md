### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of two dataframes (`self` and `other`). The function tries to compare the axes of both dataframes, then consolidates them, compares the number of blocks, sorts the blocks, and finally compares the blocks themselves. However, there is an issue when comparing the blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

The error message indicates that the comparison `assert True is False` failed, showing the dataframes that the function tried to compare.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `canonicalize` function where the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` are not forming a consistent identifier for comparing blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique identifier for each block that considers both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` values. This identifier should be consistent and easily comparable for all block types.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block._weakreflist.keymap)  # Create a unique identifier for each block

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `canonicalize` function creates a unique and consistent identifier for each block, allowing for proper comparison between dataframes.
