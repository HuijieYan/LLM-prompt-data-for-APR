### Analysis
- The function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality.
- The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal in length.
- It then checks if all axes are equal using a generator expression with `all()` and `zip()`.
- The function then consolidates both BlockManager objects inplace, which could potentially modify the internal structure.
- After consolidation, the function checks if the number of blocks in the two BlockManager objects is equal.
- The function then proceeds to sort the blocks within each BlockManager object using a custom sorting key defined by the `canonicalize` function.
- Finally, the function compares each block in the sorted lists for equality.

### Bug
Based on the error message and the provided input values and types, the bug arises from comparing two DataFrame objects with columns of different types and values. The comparison fails due to content mismatch rather than structural differences. The error message points to the issue of one DataFrame containing integers in column 'a' and strings in column 'b', while the other DataFrame has the columns swapped.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the column names and values instead of types.
- Sort the blocks based on the column names and values to match the expected behavior of comparing DataFrame objects considering content.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the column names and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        df = self if block in self.blocks else other
        return (block.index, df.get_column(block.index))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider column names and values and sorting the blocks accordingly, the corrected version should now accurately compare the two DataFrame objects. This should address the content mismatch issue observed in the failing test.
