### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals()` is failing to correctly check the equality of two DataFrame objects (`self` and `other`) based on their axes and blocks. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` because the columns in `df1` and `df2` are in a different order, but the function is returning `True` due to incorrect comparison logic. The function is sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function, but it is not considering the correct order of columns in the DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the function logic in the `equals()` method to compare the blocks based on the column order. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on the column order before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canon_cols(block):
        return list(block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canon_cols)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canon_cols)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we introduce the `canon_cols` function to extract column names from the blocks, and then we sort the blocks based on the column order before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison correctly handles differences in the column order between the two DataFrames.
