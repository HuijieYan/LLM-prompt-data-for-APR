### Error Analysis
The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This is likely due to the comparison being influenced by the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the order in which the blocks are stored within the `BlockManager` instances. The function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. However, the sorting method may not be sufficient to ensure the correct comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly between the two `BlockManager` instances. One way to address this is to extract the blocks from the `BlockManager` instances and compare them directly. Additionally, we can enhance the sorting method to consider both the type name and locations of the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = [block for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block for block in other.blocks]
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the extracted blocks after sorting them based on both the type name and locations, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
