### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have columns with different types. Since the function uses the `.equals` method internally to compare the blocks of the DataFrames, it encounters an error when trying to compare different types (integers vs. strings). The error occurs in the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` because the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `equals` to account for columns with different types when comparing the blocks. One approach to fix this bug is to explicitly check the types of the blocks before comparing them. This way, we can handle cases where the block types are different and appropriately return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if type(block) == type(oblock) else False
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By checking the types of the blocks before comparing them, we can ensure that columns with different types are not erroneously considered equal. This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test mentioned.
