### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two instances. It checks if the axes are of the same length and if all axes are equal. Then it consolidates the blocks of both instances, sorts them using a canonicalization function, and finally compares each block between the two instances.
  
2. The buggy function has a flaw in the logic where it incorrectly compares the blocks between two instances due to sorting without considering the actual block content.

3. Based on the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with different content, leading to the test failure.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic so that it checks the content of the blocks rather than relying solely on sorting.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without sorting, we ensure that the function correctly checks the equality based on block content rather than simply ordering the blocks.
