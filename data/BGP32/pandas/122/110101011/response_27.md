### Identify the Bug
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class occurs when comparing two block managers. The bug causes the function to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is identified in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Error Location
The issue arises in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The comparison should go beyond just the dtype of the blocks and include the exact locations of the blocks as well.

### Cause of the Bug
In the buggy `equals` function, the comparison of blocks does not take into account the locations of the blocks, causing the function to return True even when the blocks have different locations, as seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to include both the dtype and the manager locations. By sorting and comparing blocks based on their dtype and manager locations, we can accurately determine equality between two block managers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the buggy behavior identified in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the reported GitHub issue should be resolved.
