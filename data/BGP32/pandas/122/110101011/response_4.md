### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
- The failing test indicates that the `equals` function is not returning the expected output when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with different content.
- The runtime values for the input parameters and variables indicate that the block comparison logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect equality check of `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` object.
- The function checks for the equality of the blocks based on their types and locations, which may not be a valid comparison criterion.
- The comparison logic assumes that blocks are identical if they have the same type and locations, which is incorrect when the blocks have different content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations.
- Iterate over each block in both `BlockManager` objects and compare the content of the blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `equals` function now iterates over each block in both `BlockManager` objects and compares the content of the blocks to determine equality.
- This updated logic ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations.
