### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing the axes, blocks, and dtype of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
- The failing test is comparing two DataFrames with swapped columns, expecting `False` but currently getting `True`.
- The `equals` function sorts blocks based on block type and locations to compare them.
- The bug seems to stem from the way blocks are sorted and compared, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the sorting of blocks in the `equals` function based on dtype name and block locations.
- Since the block sorting order is based on dtype name and mgr_locs, swapping columns in DataFrames leads to different block orders.
- This difference in block order causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with swapped columns.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently regardless of their locations.
- Instead of using dtype name and mgr_locs for sorting blocks, consider alternative approaches like sorting simply based on dtype name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order based on dtype name only
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting blocks based solely on the dtype name, the corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
