### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug is identified as arising from the sorting and comparing logic of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` within the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the equality of blocks irrespective of their locations, specifically when blocks have the same data.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function should compare the blocks directly based on their data to determine equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to directly compare the data of blocks instead of sorting them based on location.
2. Update the conditional statements to ensure that the `equals` function correctly handles cases where blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on data
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks based on their data, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
