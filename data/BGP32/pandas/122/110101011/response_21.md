### Analysis:
- The function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The function checks if the axes are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks by canonicalizing them based on their data type and locations.
- The issue is due to the comparison of blocks not considering the order of elements within the blocks.
- This results in the function returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations but the same elements.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames with different element order in the same blocks and expects the `equals` function to return `False`, but it returns `True` because it doesn't account for the order of elements.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks based solely on their content without considering the order of elements within the blocks.
- The comparison function does not take into account the block locations.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to compare the blocks' content and locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on content and location before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering dtype, content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values, datatype, and location before comparing them, we ensure that the comparison considers all aspects of the blocks, leading to an accurate equality check.
