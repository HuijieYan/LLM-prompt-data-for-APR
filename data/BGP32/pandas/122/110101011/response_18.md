### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes are equal, consolidates the blocks, sorts them based on type and location, and then compares each block.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks between `self` and `other`. The current implementation is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly.
3. Given the failing test case, the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the blocks within the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The comparison method is not taking into consideration the fact that blocks can be identical but have different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True`.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can improve the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just comparing their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block content before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_list()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Additional Comments:
By converting the blocks to a list representation in the `canonicalize` function before sorting and comparing them, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual block content rather than their locations. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
