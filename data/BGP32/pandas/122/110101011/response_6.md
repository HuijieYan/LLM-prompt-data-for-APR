### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of `blocks` attribute where the order of blocks might differ, causing the comparison to fail.
3. Looking at the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, it creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' where the values are different, and then checks if `equals` method returns `False`, which it should according to the expected output.
4. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the block order is not the same.
5. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the order of blocks does not affect the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for equality of blocks in a way that ignores the block order. We can achieve this by comparing whether both `BlockManager` objects have the same set of blocks regardless of their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_set = {block.values for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_set = {block.values for block in other.blocks}
    
    return self_blocks_set == other_blocks_set
```

By inverting the comparison to use sets of blocks, we ensure that the equality comparison is order-independent. This should resolve the issue of incorrect return values and the failing test.
