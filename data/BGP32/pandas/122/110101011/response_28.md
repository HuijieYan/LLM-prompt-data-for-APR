### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are the same.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks but with different locations, hence failing the test.
3. The failure occurs because the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations due to the sorting done by `canonicalize`.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize`, which sorts based on block type and location, leading to the incorrect evaluation of equality based on location rather than content.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison in the equals function to compare the content of blocks rather than the locations. This can be achieved by comparing the actual data in the blocks rather than their sorted order based on type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the actual data in blocks, rather than their locations, the corrected version should now correctly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.
