### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances and then proceeds to compare the individual blocks within each instance.
3. The comparison of blocks is done by sorting the blocks based on their data type and location using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing each pair of blocks.
4. The bug seems to be related to comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks may not handle cases where two identical blocks have different locations.
2. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function might not be accurately evaluating the equality of blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks due to differences in their locations. The sorting based on data type and location might not be sufficient to resolve this issue, leading to false equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, an alternative approach to comparing blocks needs to be implemented. Instead of relying solely on sorting blocks by type and location, a more robust method for comparing the actual data and structure of the blocks should be used.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i, (block_self, block_other) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        if not block_self.equals(block_other):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing each block in the `self` and `other` instances using the `equals` method of the blocks, we ensure a more accurate comparison and address the issue of different locations for identical blocks. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
