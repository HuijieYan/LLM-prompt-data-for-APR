### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks' contents accurately.
2. The issue in the function lies in the comparison logic of the blocks. It fails to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` since the blocks have the same contents but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to account for different block locations while still determining equality based on their contents.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function, specifically in how it handles sorting and comparing blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. Identical content blocks with different locations are erroneously considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both dtype and mgr_locs when sorting the blocks.
2. Update the comparison of blocks to check equality based on content and location.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where identical blocks are located differently.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block's `mgr_locs` into the sorting logic and comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This fix should address the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
