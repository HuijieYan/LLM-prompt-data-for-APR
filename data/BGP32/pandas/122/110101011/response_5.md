### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. 
2. The method compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on type and manager locations, and then compares each block for equality.
3. The bug arises from how the method handles the comparison of blocks. It incorrectly returns `True` when blocks with identical data have different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual block content rather than just their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` method. When comparing blocks, the method only considers the dtype's name and manager locations, which can lead to false positives when the blocks have the same data but different locations. This issue is evident when executing the failing test, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the comparison logic to compare the actual block content rather than just the dtype name and manager locations. By comparing the block values directly, we can ensure that the equality check is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the actual block values when checking for equality, ensuring that the blocks are equal based on their data rather than just their locations. This modification should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
