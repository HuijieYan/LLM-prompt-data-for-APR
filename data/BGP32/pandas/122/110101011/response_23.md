### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
- The function first compares the `axes` of the two instances. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
- Then, it consolidates the blocks in both instances, sorts them based on type and location, and compares each block to check for equality.
- The bug seems to be in the sorting and comparison of blocks, where the function may incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the order of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances is different.
- Even if the actual contents of the blocks are the same, the function might return `True` if the blocks are sorted differently due to the way they are compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function compares the blocks in a consistent order, regardless of their initial order.
- One way to achieve this is to sort the lists of blocks based on a stable key (combination of type and location), ensuring that the comparison is consistent regardless of the order of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.__class__), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Explanation:
- In the corrected version of the function, the `canonicalize` function now generates a tuple based on the block's class name and its locations.
- Sorting the blocks based on this tuple ensures that the comparison of blocks is consistent regardless of their original order.
- This approach should fix the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected result for the failing test case.
