### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises due to incorrectly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and location, leading to a wrong equality comparison.
3. The failing test creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns in different order and expects the `equals` function to return False, but the buggy implementation leads to True.
4. To fix the bug, we should compare the actual block values instead of sorting them based on dtype name and location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the `canonicalize` function and sorting of blocks based on dtype and location.
2. Implement a direct comparison of block values.
3. Update the `equals` function to iterate through blocks and check for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Test Case:
```python
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
