### Analysis:
The buggy function, `equals`, compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing their blocks. The issue arises because when comparing blocks, it sorts them based on the dtype and location, which can cause identical blocks stored at different locations to be considered unequal.

#### Error Locations:
1. The sorting of blocks based on dtype and location in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function incorrectly considers blocks stored at different locations but having identical content as unequal, leading to the function returning `False` when it should be returning `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should revise the comparison logic for blocks to account for content equality rather than the specific storage location or order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the comparison logic to check for block content equality
    self_blocks = {block.values.tobytes() for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.values.tobytes() for block in other.blocks}
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert the block values to bytes and store them in sets for quick comparison.
- The `equals` function now returns `True` if the block content in both `BlockManager` objects is identical, irrespective of their location.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
