### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug is causing it to return `True` incorrectly in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, causing it to ignore the block location differences.
2. The comparison logic is flawed and not properly handling the comparison of blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations but not properly comparing the individual block values. This leads to cases where blocks with the same values but different locations are incorrectly marked as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to properly compare the block values in addition to their types and locations.
2. Consider the block values in the sorting step to ensure blocks with similar values are grouped together for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison logic to consider the block values, the corrected version will address the bug and pass the failing test.
