### Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality, checking their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks before comparison, which can lead to incorrect results in cases where identical blocks have different locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to assert that two DataFrames with columns swapped should not be considered equal. This is consistent with the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their order.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations before comparison. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparison results when the blocks have the same content but different locations. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data within the blocks rather than their metadata. By sorting based on data content, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their content, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly recognized as equal. This fix should address the reported bug and make the function behave as expected.
