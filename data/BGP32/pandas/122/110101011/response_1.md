### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. It compares the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances to check if they have the same length and if all corresponding axes are equal. Then, it proceeds to compare the blocks of the two instances by sorting them based on type and manager locations before checking each block for equality.
3. The identified cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the blocks is flawed, leading to false equality checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the canonicalization of blocks to ensure that similar blocks are correctly identified and compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider additional parameters or characteristics of the blocks for accurate comparison.
2. Ensure that the sorting of blocks based on the modified canonicalization is correct to identify similar blocks.
3. Update the equality check loop to compare the modified blocks for accurate results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures that blocks are correctly compared by using the block's type name and manager locations in the canonicalization process. This update helps in accurately identifying and comparing similar blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
