### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the number of axes, checks if the axes are equal, consolidates the instances, and then compares their blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns 'a' and 'b' but in reverse order. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, indicating the dataframes are not equal.
4. The bug is likely in the block comparison section where it should handle cases where identical blocks exist in different locations.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a user's expectation that the `equals` function should return `False` when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks for comparison only considers the block's type name and locations, not handling the scenario where identical blocks may exist in different locations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should include a mechanism to compare identical blocks more effectively, perhaps by incorporating additional comparison criteria beyond just the block's type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes the block's values in the `canonicalize` function for a more comprehensive comparison. It aims to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations leading to incorrect equality results.
