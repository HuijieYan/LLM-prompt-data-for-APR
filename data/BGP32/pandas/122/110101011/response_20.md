### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances and then sorts and compares the blocks within each instance.
3. The bug arises from a flaw in comparing the blocks of the two instances of `BlockManager`.
4. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations but the same content.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks using a flawed `canonicalize` function, which does not take block locations into account. This leads to incorrect equality comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for proper comparison. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.

### Updated `canonicalize` function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
```

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
