### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes and blocks of two BlockManagers for equality. The issue arises due to the comparison logic, where the function fails to handle the case where two BlockManagers have identical blocks with different locations. This leads to incorrect equality comparison results and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `equals` compares the sorted blocks of two BlockManagers based on the block's dtype name and manager locations. This approach fails when two identical blocks have different locations, resulting in a false positive equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how blocks are compared. Instead of solely relying on sorting based on dtype name and manager location, we should compare the actual contents of the blocks to determine equality. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as non-equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block contents for equality
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing the contents of the blocks directly in the corrected version, we ensure a proper equality check that considers the actual data within the blocks, resolving the issue of incorrectly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
