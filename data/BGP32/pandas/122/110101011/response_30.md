### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different orders between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting based on `canonicalize` function doesn't guarantee matching blocks between `self` and `other` due to potential differences in block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done based on the actual block contents and not just their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. We can achieve this by directly comparing the blocks in a consistent order without sorting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly in a consistent order
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without sorting. It ensures that the blocks are compared in a consistent order, fixing the issue of returning incorrect results due to differing block locations.
