### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. This function is supposed to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared due to the different order of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the bug by comparing two DataFrames with different order of values in columns `a` and `b`. The expected output is `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly regardless of their order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the reliance on sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs`. If the blocks have the same type name but different locations, they would still be considered equal.

### Correction Strategy:
1. We need to compare the blocks using type and content, rather than relying on sorting by `mgr_locs`.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider both type and content to ensure accurate equality checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by type and content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on type and content, ensuring that the comparison is accurate regardless of the order of blocks.
