### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects the equality check to return `False`.
- The buggy function compares the axes of both objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks. However, the comparison of blocks does not handle cases where identical blocks are in different locations, leading to incorrect results.
- The failing test case provides runtime values and types of variables used in the buggy function, showing the issue with the comparison of blocks due to distinct locations.
- The GitHub issue reports the problem of the `equals` method returning `True` erroneously when blocks with different locations are compared.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not handling cases where identical blocks are in different locations. The sorting mechanism based on block properties like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` may not effectively distinguish blocks with the same properties but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks by content rather than relying solely on ordering by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may lead to false positives. We should ensure the comparison of blocks accounts for potential differences in their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly compares blocks based on their content by sorting them using `tobytes()` method to create a byte representation for comparison. This approach ensures that blocks with identical content are considered equal even if they are in different positions.
