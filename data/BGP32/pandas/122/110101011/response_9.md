### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the individual blocks. 
2. The bug likely arises from the `canonicalize` function that sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting criteria might not account for all possible differences between blocks leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped. The `equals` method should correctly identify these DataFrames as not equal, but the bug prevents this.
4. A possible strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include comprehensive information about the blocks for a more accurate sort order.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Include values in sorting criteria

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values in its sorting criteria, providing a more precise order for comparison. This should accurately identify differences in blocks and fix the bug.
