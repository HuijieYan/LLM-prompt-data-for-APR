### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug incorrectly returns `True` in cases where identical blocks exist with different locations, leading to false positives in equality checks.
3. The failure of the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` occurs due to this incorrect behavior in the `equals` function, as evidenced by the provided runtime values and types of variables.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that block comparison considers both the type name and the manager locations to accurately identify block equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares blocks solely based on their content without considering their locations. Therefore, blocks with identical content but different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the manager locations of the block in the tuple used for comparison. This modification will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
