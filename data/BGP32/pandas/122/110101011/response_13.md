### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the blocks within the managers.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames that should not be equal, but due to the bug in the `equals` function, it returns `True`.
4. The bug arises when sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function, and comparing the blocks using the expression `block.equals(oblock)`. This is where the inconsistency in block order might lead to incorrect equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect management of block locations when sorting the blocks in the `equals` function. If the block locations are not consistent between the two BlockManagers being compared, it might incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks are not actually equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block locations are consistent before comparing blocks for equality. One approach could be to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations for a more precise comparison. Additionally, ensuring that the blocks are in the correct order before comparison can address the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block info and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the block managers and return `False` for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
