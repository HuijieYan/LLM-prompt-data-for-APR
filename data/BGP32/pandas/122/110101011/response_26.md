### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class, which is used to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects to check for equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different types and expects them to be not equal.
4. The runtime values show that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples with the same blocks but in different order, causing the equality check to fail.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the incorrect behavior of `equals` method when dealing with identical blocks in different positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of `sorted` to sort the blocks based on their type name and location, which can result in different block order comparisons between `self` and `other`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the block order comparison is consistent regardless of the block order in the `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `tobytes()` method in the canonicalization step, we ensure consistent block order comparison, thus fixing the bug.
