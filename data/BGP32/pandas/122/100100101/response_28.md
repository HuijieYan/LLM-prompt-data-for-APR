The bug in the provided function `equals` is that it is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects `self` and `other`. The function is trying to compare blocks directly using the `equals` method without considering the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks. This will ensure that we are comparing blocks correctly based on their type and position within the data structure.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks are compared based on their data type and position within the BlockManager. This should fix the bug and make the function correctly compare two BlockManager objects.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
