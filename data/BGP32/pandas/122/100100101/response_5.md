### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManagers for equality. The issue arises due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the internal blocks' order. To fix this, we need to sort the blocks before comparison based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug explanation:
The bug occurs because the function does not ensure a consistent order of blocks before comparison. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the `df1` and `df2` dataframes have differently ordered blocks. However, the `equals` function does not sort the blocks leading to a mismatch.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists before the comparison.
2. Use a `canonicalize` function to return a comparable key based on block type and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the fix above, the corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
