### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` as the sorting key. The issue is that `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is causing a problem because it returns a list, which cannot be directly used for comparison in the tuple.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple that can be compared. We can achieve this by converting the list obtained from `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` into a tuple.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))  # Convert list to tuple

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting the list from `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple, we ensure that the sorting key is properly formed and comparison is done correctly. The corrected function should now pass the provided failing test case.
