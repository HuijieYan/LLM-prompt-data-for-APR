### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes the function to fail when comparing the blocks due to an issue in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function is returning a tuple that includes the block's `mgr_locs` as an array, but the comparison operation `block.equals(oblock)` in the return statement is failing because `mgr_locs` is not a property of the `Block` class.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to exclude the `mgr_locs` attribute while sorting the blocks. This will allow the function to properly compare the blocks based on their data type without considering the `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting by `mgr_locs` and focusing only on the `dtype.name`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
