### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of values in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function but does not consider the actual content of the blocks. This leads to a false comparison when the blocks have different content, resulting in a wrong return value of `True`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to compare the content of the blocks rather than just their attributes. We should compare each individual block's content instead of comparing the sorted lists of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparing each block based on content
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By comparing each block's content directly, the corrected version of the function ensures a proper comparison between two `BlockManager` instances, allowing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to pass as expected.
