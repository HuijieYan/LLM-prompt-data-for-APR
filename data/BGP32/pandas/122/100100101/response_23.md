### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on axes and block data.
2. The function checks the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, then compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The issue arises because the function fails to sort the blocks before comparing them, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from not sorting the blocks before the comparison. In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns but in a different order. The function does not handle this case correctly, leading to a false negative (indicating they are not equal when they should be).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparing them. This will ensure that the order of the blocks does not affect the equality check.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on block content
    def key_func(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            block.items,
            block.shape,
            block.dtypes
        )
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key_func)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key_func)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this fix ensures that the blocks are sorted before comparison, resolving the issue with the incorrect ordering of blocks in the failing test case.
