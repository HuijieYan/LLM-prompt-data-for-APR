The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type name and memory locations using the `canonicalize` function. However, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method fails when the data types of corresponding blocks are different.

The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly in cases where the data types are different, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the data types of the blocks are the same before proceeding with the comparison using the `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        if block.dtype == oblock.dtype
    )
```

This corrected version includes an additional condition `if block.dtype == oblock.dtype` within the `all()` statement to ensure that only blocks with the same data types are compared using the `equals` method. This modification fixes the bug and ensures the function behaves correctly.

Once the corrected version of the function is implemented, it should pass the failing test case provided.
