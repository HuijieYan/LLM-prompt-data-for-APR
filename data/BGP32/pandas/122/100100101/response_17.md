The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The function checks if the axes of the two BlockManagers are of equal length and if all corresponding axes are equal. Then it consolidates the blocks within the BlockManager objects and checks if the number of blocks is the same. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a key for sorting the blocks, but the comparison logic based on this key may not be correct, leading to incorrect results.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the comparison logic for sorting and comparing blocks based on type name and manager locations is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided. It fixes the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks based on type name and manager locations.
