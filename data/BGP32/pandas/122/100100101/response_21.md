### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects. The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two objects are equal. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic of the `blocks` attribute. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, but this sorting might not correctly consider the order of the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with different values. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` when comparing these two DataFrames because their values are not equal. However, due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function, it might incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is done correctly. One approach is to directly compare the block values for equality instead of relying on sorting and canonicalization.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without sorting, the function should now correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects and return `False` as expected when they are not equal.
