### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly even when the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. The bug arises from how the function compares the blocks internally, which leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly compares the blocks within the DataFrames. This can be achieved by correctly iterating over the blocks and comparing them based on their content rather than their order.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version provided above, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully, as the function now correctly checks for equality between the blocks in the DataFrames.
