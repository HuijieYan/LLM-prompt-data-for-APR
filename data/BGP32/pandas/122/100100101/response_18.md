### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then checks if the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is causing the function to return `False` incorrectly, even when the `BlockManager` objects should be considered equal. This bug leads to failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` which expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`.

The bug occurs when sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. The issue arises from comparing the `mgr_locs` of the blocks, which may not be reliable for determining equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should avoid using `mgr_locs` for comparison as it may vary. Instead, we can compare the blocks directly using their content and metadata.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version and removing the dependency on `mgr_locs`, the function should now correctly determine the equality of the `BlockManager` objects. It should pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
