The buggy function `equals` is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The function compares the axes, consolidates the dataframes, and then checks if the blocks are equal. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when the blocks are not consolidated in the same order. This results in the comparison failing even when the dataframes could be equal.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the index information for better distinction.
3. Sort the blocks based on the modified `canonicalize` function before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the blocks are consolidated and sorted before comparison, allowing for a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
