### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function performs checks on the axes and blocks of both objects to determine if they are equal. However, the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function where the sorting of blocks is done based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This sorting may not accurately represent the true order of blocks and can lead to incorrect results when comparing.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with different values. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the sorting of blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` can potentially mix up the order of blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks remains consistent during comparison. We should sort the blocks based on a more reliable attribute that uniquely identifies each block, such as the index of the block.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Correction Explanation:
- In the corrected function, we sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the unique identifier of each block, i.e., `id(block)`. This ensures that the order of blocks is consistent and remains the same during comparison.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test case.
