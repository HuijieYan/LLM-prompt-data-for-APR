The bug in the `equals` function is due to the sorting method used on `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function currently compares block types and locations but does not show the actual content comparison, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate block content for comparison. We can achieve this by creating a new tuple that includes type, manager locations, and block values. This new tuple will allow for a more accurate comparison between blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the content of the blocks in addition to their types and locations, ensuring a correct evaluation of DataFrame equality.
