The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely to be causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The function compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` by checking the axes, blocks, and individual blocks for equality. However, the function does not handle the case where the dtype of the blocks is different, which leads to incorrect results in the comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to enhance the comparison mechanism to also consider the dtype of the blocks when checking for equality. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype in the tuple comparison and then sorting the blocks accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype name, type name, and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will now consider the dtype of the blocks when sorting for comparison. It should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
