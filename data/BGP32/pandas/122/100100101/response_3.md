### Analysis
The `equals` function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` instances have the same length. Then it iterates through the axes to check if each axis is equal using the `equals` method. Next, it consolidates the blocks of both instances and checks if the number of blocks are equal. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks after canonicalizing them based on block type and locations.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the canonicalization step. The `canonicalize` function compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, where `mgr_locs` needs to be transformed into a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This transformation was missing in the original implementation, causing an AttributeError when attempting to access `as_array.tolist()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert `mgr_locs` into a list before comparison. By modifying `canonicalize` to include `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we can ensure that comparison is done accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `canonicalize` function including `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the comparison based on block type and locations should work correctly, fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
