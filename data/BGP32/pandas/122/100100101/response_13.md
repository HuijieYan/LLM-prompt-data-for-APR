### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of DataFrames in the `canonicalize` function using the `block.equals(oblock)` method. This method call compares the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, which contains the slice defining the block location, but it does not compare the data itself within the block.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying solely on the `block.equals(oblock)` comparison, we should compare the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def equal_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(equal_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the values within the blocks instead of just the block locations, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data content of the blocks rather than just their locations.
