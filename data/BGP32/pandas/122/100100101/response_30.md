### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager instances for equality. The issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager. The function sorts the blocks using a custom key `canonicalize` which combines the dtype name and manager locations of the block. However, in the failing test case, the input DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types, which makes the comparison fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the blocks have different data types and the order of columns in the DataFrames is different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where the columns have different data types. We can compare blocks based on both data type and order of columns in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if (block.dtype.name, list(block.items)) != (oblock.dtype.name, list(oblock.items)):
            return False
        
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected function compares blocks in the BlockManager based on both data type and order of columns to handle cases where columns have different data types and different orders.
