### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of axes are equal, then proceeds to compare each axis using the `equals` method.
3. The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks. It sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized order using `canonicalize` function which sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This can lead to incorrect comparison results, especially when the blocks contain different data types.
4. To fix the bug, we should compare blocks without sorting them based on dtype name and manager locations. We can iterate through the blocks directly and compare them.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations before comparison. This sorting can lead to incorrect results, especially when the blocks contain different data types.

### Fix:
I will revise the `equals` function to directly iterate through the blocks and compare them without sorting. 

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By directly iterating through the blocks and comparing them, we can avoid the incorrect comparison caused by sorting based on dtype name and manager locations.
