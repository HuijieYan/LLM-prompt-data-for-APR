### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue arises when comparing two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` in different orders. Since the function sorts based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, it ends up treating data in different columns as equal due to the sorting. This leads to the incorrect validation of DataFrame equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the column name and data for proper sorting. By incorporating the column name along with `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that the sorting is done correctly and the comparison between DataFrames is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, column name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block, col_name):
        return (block.dtype.name, col_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted([(self.blocks[i], self.items[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(other.blocks[i], other.items[i]) for i in range(len(other.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the column name along with `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected function can properly sort the blocks and validate DataFrame equality accurately.
