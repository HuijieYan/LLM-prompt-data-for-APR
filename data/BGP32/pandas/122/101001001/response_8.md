### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, there is a bug in the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The bug is caused by calling `as_array` on the `mgr_locs` attribute of a block, but in reality, `mgr_locs` is not a valid attribute of the block object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to use a valid attribute of the block object for sorting. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block.dtype.name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now correctly uses `block.dtype.name` for sorting the blocks before comparison. This should resolve the bug in the function.
