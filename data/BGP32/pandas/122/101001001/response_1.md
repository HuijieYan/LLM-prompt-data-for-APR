### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs due to the improper comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The function is trying to compare the blocks without considering the specific order of the blocks within each BlockManager. As a result, even if the blocks contain the same data, but in a different order, the function would incorrectly identify them as different.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManagers considers the order of the blocks. One way to achieve this is by properly sorting the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their values before comparison, ensuring that similar blocks will be matched correctly even if they are in a different order within the BlockManager.
