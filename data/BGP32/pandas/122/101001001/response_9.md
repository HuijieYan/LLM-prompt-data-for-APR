### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The issue stems from how the `canonicalize` function generates a key to sort the blocks. 

In the `canonicalize` function, the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` tries to access the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs`. However, `mgr_locs` is an instance of `BlockPlacement` which doesn't have an `as_array` attribute. This leads to an AttributeError, causing the function to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to return a key that doesn't rely on the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs`. We can consider using other properties of the `block` object to create a unique key for sorting. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return type(block).__name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, we have simplified the `canonicalize` function to only return the type name of the block for sorting. This modification ensures that the function won't encounter an AttributeError when trying to access invalid attributes.
