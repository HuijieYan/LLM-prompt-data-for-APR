### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function attempts to create a key for sorting by combining the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of each block. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute used in `canonicalize` to sort the blocks is not accessible or defined within the `Block` class.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the `Block` class has an attribute `mgr_locs` that can be accessed within the `canonicalize` function. Since the `Block` class is not available in the provided code snippet, we can assume that `mgr_locs` is a common attribute across blocks that can be accessed. If that assumption is correct, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to work with this common attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain the same
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define the canonicalize function using a common attribute like mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        # Assuming mgr_locs is a common attribute across blocks
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is defined assuming `mgr_locs` is a common attribute across blocks. This modification allows the sorting based on the specified criteria without encountering the attribute access issue.
