### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs when comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The function compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks in the two instances by sorting them. The bug arises from a mistake in the sorting process where it tries to sort tuples based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes.

The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing two instances of `BlockManager` due to incorrect sorting of the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism by addressing the `mgr_locs` attribute in a different way to ensure proper comparison of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block._get_sorted_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use a custom `canonicalize` function that considers the block's values for comparison. By doing so, we ensure that the blocks are properly sorted before comparing them for equality.
