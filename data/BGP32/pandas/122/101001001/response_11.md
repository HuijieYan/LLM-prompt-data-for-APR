### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs due to the sorting of blocks based on their data types and locations (`mgr_locs`). The `canonicalize` function used for sorting is missing the proper handling of `mgr_locs` to generate a comparable value for blocks. This causes the blocks to be sorted incorrectly, leading to a false comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly generates comparable values for the blocks based on both their data types and `mgr_locs`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.blocks[0].as_array.tolist())

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the data type of the block values and properly extracts the `mgr_locs` information for sorting the blocks accurately. This modification ensures a proper comparison of blocks and resolves the bug.
