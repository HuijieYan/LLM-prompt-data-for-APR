### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the bug occurs when trying to consolidate the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, as well as when comparing the individual blocks for equality. The issue arises from the sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize` function that is missing crucial properties or methods.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly consider the properties needed for identifying and sorting the blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that essential attributes of the blocks are considered in the equality comparison. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version takes into account the block type name and `mgr_locs` property within the `canonicalize` function, which should help in properly identifying and comparing the blocks for equality.
