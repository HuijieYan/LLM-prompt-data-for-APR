### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the sorting of blocks to check for equality. The function attempts to sort the blocks using a custom key composed of the dtype name and the mgr_locs of each block. However, the Bug is caused by improperly extracting the dtype name and mgr_locs values from each block.

### Bug Fix
To correct the bug, the function needs to properly extract the dtype name and mgr_locs from each block before sorting them. The current attempt to access `block.dtype.name` should be `block.dtype`, and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be `block.mgr_locs`. Additionally, the `BlockPlacement` object demonstrates reference to the positions of the blocks and should be handled correctly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version addresses the bug by correctly extracting the dtype and mgr_locs values from each block to ensure proper sorting.
