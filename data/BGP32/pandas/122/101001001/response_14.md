### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the way the blocks are being sorted before comparison. The function is attempting to canonicalize blocks based on their dtype name and the locations allocated in the BlockPlacement object. However, when calling `as_array.tolist()` on `block.mgr_locs`, it is assuming that `mgr_locs` is an array directly, which is causing the error.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to access the array from `mgr_locs` properly. It seems that `mgr_locs` is a `BlockPlacement` object, which contains a slice object, `type('slice')`, indicating the location of the block. We should modify the canonicalize function to extract the start, stop, and step values from this slice object to create a tuple for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    locs = block.mgr_locs
    slice_obj = locs.slice
    return (block.dtype.name, (slice_obj.start, slice_obj.stop, slice_obj.step))

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
``` 

In this corrected version, we correctly extract the start, stop, and step values from the slice object within `mgr_locs` to create a tuple for comparison during sorting. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to compare blocks correctly.
