### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is done using the `equals` method of each block object. However, the bug originates from how the `canonicalize` function is structured. The `canonicalize` function combines the block's `dtype.name` (data type name) and `mgr_locs` into a tuple for sorting the blocks. The issue arises from calling `as_array.tolist()` on `block.mgr_locs`, which results in a TypeError due to the inconsistency in calling `tolist()` on an ndarray. 

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute. Instead of calling `as_array.tolist()`, we should directly store `mgr_locs` as a tuple to maintain consistency for sorting. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

# Updated buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function as shown and using `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` directly, we resolve the TypeError that causes the bug. This corrected version should now compare and sort the blocks properly, fixing the bug.
