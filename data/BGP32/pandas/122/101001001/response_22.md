### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function, the bug is related to the comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs because the function is sorting and comparing blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` is not being handled correctly.

At the end of the function, the `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on a tuple containing the `dtype.name` and the `as_array` representation of `mgr_locs`. The issue arises in the `as_array.tolist()` call for `mgr_locs`, which converts the `BlockPlacement` object to a list incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is correctly converted to a list for comparison. One way to achieve this is to modify the `BlockPlacement` class to have a method that returns the proper representation needed for comparison. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the modification mentioned above:

```python
class BlockPlacement:
    def as_list(self):
        # Convert the BlockPlacement object to a list representation
        return list(self)

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Fixing the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_list())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By adding the `as_list` method to the `BlockPlacement` class and utilizing it in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly in the `equals` function.
