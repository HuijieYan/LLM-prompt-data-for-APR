### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is attempting to sort blocks based on a tuple of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the bug occurs due to the usage of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is not a correct way to get a list representation of the block's locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly create the tuple for sorting the blocks. Specifically, we need to extract and sort the block locations properly before comparing blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, sorted(list(block.mgr_locs)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function as described above, the sorting of blocks based on type and locations will be accurate, resolving the bug in the `equals` function.
