### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks within two BlockManagers. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and the locations within the manager, but it fails to properly compare the actual content of the blocks. This issue occurs because the `equals` method is directly comparing the blocks without considering their internal data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to modify the `equals` method to compare the content of the blocks instead of just their types and locations. This can be achieved by updating the comparison logic to compare the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._is_numeric, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison now directly compares the values within the blocks using the `values` attribute, ensuring a proper comparison of the blocks' content.
