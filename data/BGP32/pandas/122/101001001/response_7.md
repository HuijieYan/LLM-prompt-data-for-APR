## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of different blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, in the `canonicalize` function, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed directly as an object and converted to a list incorrectly using `as_array`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block as a list. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_tuple_slice().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we replaced `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` with `block.mgr_locs.get_tuple_slice().tolist()` to correctly access the manager locations as a list. This change ensures that the comparison between blocks is done accurately, fixing the bug in the function.
