### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal in length, then iterates over the blocks within each `BlockManager`, sorts them based on a canonicalization logic, and finally compares each pair of corresponding blocks for equality.

### Issues:
1. The canonicalization function `canonicalize` within the buggy function incorrectly references `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` without considering the correct attributes or properties of the blocks.
2. The `BlockManager` object `self` and `other` are being consolidated in-place using `_consolidate_inplace` method, which changes the state of the objects, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. Incorrect use of `sorted` function for sorting the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
4. The comparison logic in the `all` method at the end is affected by the incorrect canonicalization logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract relevant attributes from the block objects for sorting.
2. Avoid in-place consolidation of `BlockManager` objects inside the `equals` function.
3. Revise the sorting mechanism for blocks using custom comparison functions.
4. Adjust the comparison logic at the end based on correct canonicalization to compare the sorted blocks.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.values.flatten().tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.values.flatten().tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- `canonicalize` function is replaced with lambda functions in the `sorted` calls to properly sort blocks based on type and values.
- In-place consolidation `_consolidate_inplace` is removed to prevent unintended state changes.
- Comparison logic is refined to use the sorted blocks for equality comparison.

By applying these fixes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
