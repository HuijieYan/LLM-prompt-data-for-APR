### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the way the `canonicalize` function was defined and how it was used to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `canonicalize` function is expected to return a tuple of the block's `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` as a list. However, in the buggy implementation, the `mgr_locs` was accessed incorrectly by using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.tolist()`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly return a tuple combining the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` as a list. The correction involves changing `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug related to the incorrect access to `mgr_locs` should be fixed, and the function should work correctly for comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager`.
