### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing the `dtype` of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is done based on the `dtype.name` attribute of each block. However, the `dtype.name` attribute does not contain enough information to uniquely identify and compare blocks, especially when multiple blocks have the same data type. This can lead to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate more information to distinguish blocks. One way to achieve this is by including the shape of the block along with the `dtype.name` in the tuple used for canonicalization.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the updated `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using dtype name and shape
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.shape), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the shape of the block along with the `dtype.name` in the canonicalization process, we ensure that blocks are uniquely identified and compared correctly. This fix addresses the bug in the original function.
