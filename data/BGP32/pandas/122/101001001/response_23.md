## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple created by the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` attribute, which is a list in the form of `BlockPlacement(slice(0, 1, 1))`. However, the comparison based on `mgr_locs` may not be appropriate, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` for comparisons. This way, the equality check will rely solely on the block data type, ensuring a valid comparison between blocks.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name`, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is based on a reliable criterion, which should address the bug.
