### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The issue is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly extracting the relevant information for comparison, leading to incorrect results.

In the `canonicalize` function, the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is trying to access a method that does not exist for the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block`. This results in a `AttributeError` and likely disrupts the comparison between blocks.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the information for comparison. Since the `mgr_locs` attribute needs to be converted to a list for comparisons, we can achieve that by updating the `canonicalize` function as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))
```

This modification will ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is converted to a list before comparison, fixing the bug in the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly extracting and comparing the relevant block information.
