### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates them in place and compares the blocks they contain. The bug arises in the block comparison part of the function due to incorrect sorting of the blocks based on a canonical representation.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The `as_array` method should be called on `block.mgr_locs` to obtain the list representation of the locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `BlockPlacement` object does not have a `as_array` attribute directly, but it has the `tolist` method that should be used. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `as_array` on `block.mgr_locs`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
Modify the `canonicalize` function to use the `tolist` method of `mgr_locs`. This will correctly generate a tuple for sorting based on the block's dtype name and locations list representation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

# Update the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this adjustment in the `canonicalize` function to use `tolist` on `mgr_locs`, the function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
