### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely occurring due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts these blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple with the block's data type name and manager locations as a list. However, the `canonicalize` function is currently using the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call, which is causing the bug.

The bug arises because `mgr_locs` is expected to be a `BlockPlacement` object, but it is being treated as an attribute instead of an object. This leads to a runtime error when trying to call `as_array.tolist()` on `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is correctly treated as a `BlockPlacement` object and access its attributes properly. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to extract the required information from `mgr_locs` in a correct way.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now properly extract information from `mgr_locs` by converting it to a tuple, addressing the bug identified.
