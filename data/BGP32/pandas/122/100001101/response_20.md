### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, it fails to compare the blocks correctly due to unconsolidated blocks.

In the provided test case:
- `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain the same blocks but in different order, which results in the false negative of the equality check.
- The `sorted` function sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, `mgr_locs` might not represent the actual block placement leading to incorrect sorting.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within `BlockManager` objects are correctly compared for equality. One approach to achieve this is to consolidate the blocks before comparing them based on their relevant attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))

    def get_blocks(self):
        blocks = []
        for block in self.blocks:
            if len(blocks) == 0:
                blocks.append(block)
            else:
                merged = False
                for index, existing_block in enumerate(blocks):
                    if block.equals(existing_block):
                        merged = True
                        break
                if not merged:
                    blocks.append(block)
        return blocks
```

In this corrected version:
- The `get_blocks` method consolidates the blocks within a `BlockManager` by comparing if they are equal. This ensures that we have a list of unique blocks for comparison.
- We use the consolidated blocks for comparison in the equality check. This approach accounts for unconsolidated blocks and ensures a more accurate comparison between `BlockManager` objects.
