### Analyzing the buggy function
The `equals` function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are equal. The function first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks. The comparison of blocks involves sorting them based on their datatype and manager locations before checking if each block is equal between the two instances.

### Identified issue
The bug in the function lies in the sorting of blocks based on the datatype and manager locations. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting is not handling the data correctly, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly sort the blocks based on their datatype and manager locations. This correction will ensure that the blocks are correctly aligned for comparison.

### Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.to_slice(), str(block.dtype))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on their manager locations and datatype, the `equals` function should now work correctly and provide the expected comparison results.
