### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function arises from the way the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks using the `mgr_locs`. The `mgr_locs` attribute is expected to be an array, but the buggy implementation uses `as_array.tolist()`, which converts the array to a list. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is used as an array for sorting, instead of converting it to a list. By keeping `mgr_locs` as an array within the `canonicalize` function, the blocks will be correctly sorted and compared.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `mgr_locs` attribute is used directly without conversion to a list within the `canonicalize` function, fixing the sorting and comparison issue. This should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
