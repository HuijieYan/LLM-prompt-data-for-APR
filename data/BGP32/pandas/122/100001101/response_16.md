The buggy function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. It checks the axes, block counts, and then the individual blocks for equality. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function.

The expected output values indicate that the `canonicalize` function is intended to ensure that blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. However, in the given buggy function, the `canonicalize` function does not consider the dtype of the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly consider the dtype of the blocks. By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype in the sorting key, we can ensure that blocks are correctly ordered based on both dtype and mgr_locs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block` itself in the sorting key of the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that blocks are compared correctly based on both dtype and mgr_locs, fixing the bug in the function.
