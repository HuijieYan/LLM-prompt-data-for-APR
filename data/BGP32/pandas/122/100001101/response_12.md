The bug in the provided function arises from incorrect sorting of blocks when comparing two BlockManagers. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return False even if the two BlockManagers are actually equal.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to include the block items in addition to dtype and mgr_locs. This will ensure a more accurate comparison between the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block items for more accuracy
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now accurately compare the BlockManagers based on dtype, mgr_locs, and block items, resolving the bug in the function.
