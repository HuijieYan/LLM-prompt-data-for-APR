### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal. The issue seems to arise in the way the function is comparing blocks during the sorting process with the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The function fails to correctly handle the comparison of block types, resulting in incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function considers the type of blocks as well when sorting. One way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block type in the tuple. Additionally, we should compare the block types before comparing the block content.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block type for correct sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare block types before block content
    return all(
        block_type == oblock_type and block.equals(oblock)
        for (block_type, block), (oblock_type, oblock) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block type in the `canonicalize` function and comparing the block type before the block content, we can ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared in the `equals` function.
