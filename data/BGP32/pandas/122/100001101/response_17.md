The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects which contain axes and blocks. The bug lies in the comparison logic of the blocks in the two objects. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs to ensure comparability. However, the comparison logic is flawed due to not considering missing blocks in one of the objects.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the canonicalization function to handle cases where one BlockManager has more blocks than the other.
2. Handle cases where one BlockManager has more blocks than the other while comparing the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Now, the function will correctly handle cases where the number of blocks in each BlockManager object is different.
