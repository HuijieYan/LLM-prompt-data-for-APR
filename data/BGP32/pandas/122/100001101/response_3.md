The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The bug arises from sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` separately instead of sorting them together based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`. This results in the incorrect comparison and leads to a false mismatch in the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks together before comparing them. By sorting them based on both `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`, we ensure that the blocks are ordered consistently before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version properly sorts the blocks from both `self` and `other` based on both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, ensuring a correct comparison and fixing the bug.
