### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is designed to compare two instances of BlockManager by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal. However, the bug arises due to the sorting mechanism based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may not provide a consistent order without considering the actual block content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should focus on comparing the block contents themselves rather than relying on `canonicalize` for sorting. By iterating over the blocks and comparing them directly, we can ensure a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we directly compare the blocks of `self` and `other` instances without the sorting mechanism. This ensures a more accurate comparison based on the actual block contents.
