### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is comparing two BlockManagers, `self` and `other`, for equality. It first checks if the number of axes in both managers is the same, then it iterates over each axis and compares them using the `.equals()` method. If the axes are equal, it consolidates the managers and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it attempts to compare each block within the managers. However, the comparison of blocks has a bug due to the way the `canonicalize` function is defined and applied to sort the blocks.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function where it tries to access `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. In the provided runtime input, the `block` object is of type `IntBlock`, which does not have the attributes `dtype` or `mgr_locs`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access these non-existent attributes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the block type might not have the `dtype` or `mgr_locs` attributes. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to check for the existence of these attributes before trying to access them. This way, we ensure that only attributes available in the specific block type are used for comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = getattr(block, 'dtype', None)
        mgr_locs = getattr(block, 'mgr_locs', None)
        return (dtype_name, mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

``` 

This corrected version handles cases where attributes may not exist in certain block types, preventing AttributeError from being raised. Now the function should compare block types correctly and address the bug.
