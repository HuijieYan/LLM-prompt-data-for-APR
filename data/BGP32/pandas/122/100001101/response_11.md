### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block` and `oblock` are being compared for equality using the `equals` method. The bug arises from the fact that `mgr_locs` is being compared using `as_array.tolist()` which returns a list rather than an array, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to directly use `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list. This will ensure that the comparison is done correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list, the corrected version of the function should now provide the intended results.
