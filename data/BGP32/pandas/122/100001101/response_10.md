The bug in the provided function arises from the way blocks are sorted and compared for equality. The function is comparing the blocks based on the `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` are being accessed incorrectly when using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

The correct way to access `mgr_locs` is `block.mgr_locs.to_slice()`. This change will ensure that the `mgr_locs` is in a format that can be compared. Additionally, the comparison based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.to_slice()` should be done inside the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with comparing `mgr_locs` and ensures a valid approach to check for equality based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.to_slice()`.
