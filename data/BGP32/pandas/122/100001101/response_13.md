The bug in the provided function lies in the canonicalization step where the block order is sorted based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue arises from the comparison of dtype.name and mgr_locs using a tuple, which does not account for the underlying data comparison. This can lead to incorrect results in scenarios where the blocks have the same dtype and mgr_locs but contain different data.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just the dtype name and mgr_locs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected function, we directly iterate through the blocks in both BlockManagers and check for equality by invoking the `equals()` method of each individual block. This ensures that we are comparing the actual data within the blocks rather than just the dtype name and mgr_locs.

This corrected version should now provide the expected output and handle the comparisons accurately.
