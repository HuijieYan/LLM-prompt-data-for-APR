### Error:
The buggy function is not correctly comparing the `Block` objects within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. It is sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which is used to order the blocks before comparison. However, the `canonicalize` function does not handle all block types properly, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle all block types like `ObjectBlock` and results in incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types correctly for comparison. By ensuring that the `canonicalize` function uniquely identifies and sorts the blocks based on their types and other relevant properties, we can correctly compare the blocks between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block type, size, and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tostring())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (str(block.dtype), hash(tuple(block.values)))
        else:
            return (str(block.dtype), hash(tuple(block.values)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By adjusting the `canonicalize` function to consider different block types like `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` properly for sorting, we ensure that blocks are compared accurately, thus fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
