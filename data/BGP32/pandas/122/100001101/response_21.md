### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering the order of axes. The comparison is currently done directly using `!=`, which does not account for the order of axes and may lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of axes while comparing `self_axes` and `other_axes`. One way to achieve this is to sort the axes before comparing them to ensure they are in the same order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort the blocks by canonicalize function before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
