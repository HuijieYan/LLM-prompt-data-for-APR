### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the current implementation arises from the sorting logic inside the `equals` function. The function attempts to canonicalize blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the `dtype.name` does not uniquely identify the block since there can be multiple blocks with the same `dtype.name` but different data. This causes the incorrect comparison of blocks and leads to erroneous results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information that uniquely identifies each block. One approach could be to include the data values of the block along with `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to uniquely identify each block during sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype.name, data values, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing blocks based on `dtype.name`, data values, and `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that each block is uniquely identified and sorted correctly, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
