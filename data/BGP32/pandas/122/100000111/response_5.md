### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The bug seems to be in the function's comparison logic, where it fails to consider the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` during the comparison.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing blocks with different locations but identical contents.
4. To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the `mgr_locs` attribute into the comparison logic.

### Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)` in the comparison loop, we ensure that the function considers both block contents and their locations during the equality check, addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
