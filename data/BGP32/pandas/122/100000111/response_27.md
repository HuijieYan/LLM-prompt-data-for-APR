### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances. It first checks if the lengths of their axes are equal and then compares the individual blocks within them.
- The bug seems to arise from the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This sorting may cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered different.
- The GitHub issue states that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks in the `canonicalize` function sorting methodology. Sorting based on the block's dtype and location may lead to incorrect identification of identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to avoid sorting the blocks based on potentially unique attributes like location.
- We can modify the `canonicalize` function to prioritize dtype alone for a fair comparison.
- The blocks should be compared directly without changing their order based on locations.

### Bug-fixed Implementation:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Simply compare blocks without sorting based on location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected implementation would address the issue reported on GitHub by comparing the blocks directly without altering their order based on location.
