### Analysis:
The function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks' equality, which involves sorting them by type name and `mgr_locs` but this could lead to incorrect results when blocks have identical content but are at different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the block comparison section, where the blocks are sorted by `canonicalize` function that considers both type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison approach so that identical blocks in different locations are not considered as equal. One way to achieve this is to compare the blocks directly without sorting them.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
``` 

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`, ensuring that blocks in different locations are not considered equal.
