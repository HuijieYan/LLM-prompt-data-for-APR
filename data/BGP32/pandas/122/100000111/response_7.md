### Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This behavior is not expected and needs to be fixed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between blocks might be failing due to different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function might not be properly handling the differences in block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function compares blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks are identical in content but differ in location, they are considered unequal due to how the `canonicalize` function is designed. This causes the function to return `False` even for identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should not rely on their locations. Instead, the comparison should be based solely on the content of the blocks. By removing the consideration of block locations in the comparison, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function removes the consideration of block locations in the comparison and focuses solely on the content of the blocks. This adjustment ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
