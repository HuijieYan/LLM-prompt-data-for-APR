### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block locations. The bug seems to arise from comparing blocks that have the same content but different locations as equal.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to occur during the comparison of blocks in the `canonicalize` function using `block.equals(oblock)`, which does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `equals` compares the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects based on their content and not their exact locations. This leads to situations where blocks with the same content but different locations are considered unequal, causing incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to consider the exact locations of the blocks, in addition to their content. By taking into account the block locations in the comparison process, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly marked as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs._locs.tupleize())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by considering the exact locations of the blocks during the comparison process, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
