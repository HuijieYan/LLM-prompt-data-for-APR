### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their attributes. However, in the buggy version, the comparison logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison logic within the function.
2. Sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations within the `BlockManager` objects. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior in the GitHub issue. The issue clearly states that when blocks have different locations, the function should return `False`, which is not happening due to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to check for equality based on the block's content and not its location.
2. Modify the sorting mechanism to ensure that blocks with different locations do not affect the equality comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function now sorts the blocks based on their content (`block.values.tobytes()`) to ensure that the equality comparison is not affected by their locations. This fixes the bug and aligns the function's behavior with the expected output described in the GitHub issue.
