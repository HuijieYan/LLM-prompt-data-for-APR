### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison involves checking if the axes are of equal length, if all axes are equal, and if all blocks are equal. The bug arises when the function incorrectly returns `True` even when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks might not handle the case of blocks with the same content but different locations.
2. Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs might not fully capture the differences in block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly consider block locations in the comparison. It compares blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, but if two blocks have the same content but different locations, they may be deemed equal incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the block comparison by not only considering dtype name and mgr_locs but also checking the content of the blocks completely. We can adjust the logic of block comparison to include a comparison of block values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: repr(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: repr(x))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `equals` function now compares blocks based on their content in addition to dtype name and mgr_locs. This should address the issue described in the GitHub post and properly handle cases where blocks have identical content but different locations.
