## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and blocks' locations are equal. However, the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue arises due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. The function fails to consider the actual block data and only focuses on the block type and locations, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function `equals` only considers the dtype and mgr_locs of each block while comparing, leading to a false comparison in cases where the blocks contain the same data but exist in different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the comparison of blocks should involve checking if the actual data within the blocks is equal, rather than just comparing their dtype and locations. The focus should be on the block values rather than the block metadata.

## Corrected Version of the function
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their values before comparison, ensuring that the actual data within the blocks is considered during the equality check.

By updating the comparison logic to focus on the block values, this corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and provide the expected output for the given test case.
