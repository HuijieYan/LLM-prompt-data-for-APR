### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances along with their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `blocks` within the `BlockManager`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. Sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. `canonicalize` function implementation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to the sorting mechanism used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison of blocks is primarily based on the `canonicalize` function, which takes the data type name and `mgr_locs` as criteria for sorting. If blocks are identical but have different locations, this sorting strategy might consider them different, leading to the incorrect evaluation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism. Instead of relying on `mgr_locs` for sorting, we can consider comparing blocks based on their actual content rather than their specific locations.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

This correction ensures that the function directly compares each block in `self` with any corresponding block in `other`, avoiding the sorting issue. This modification should address the problem reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
