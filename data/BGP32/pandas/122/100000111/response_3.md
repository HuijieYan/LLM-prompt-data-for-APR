### Analysis:
1. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal and if all blocks within them are equal.
2. The bug seems to occur in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where the blocks are not correctly sorted before comparison.
3. The bug results in the function erroneously returning `True` when the blocks have different locations despite being identical.

### Error:
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function does not account for the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality determination.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted consistently based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This will allow for accurate comparison of the blocks and prevent the function from incorrectly returning `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before comparison to ensure consistent block order and accurate equality determination, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
