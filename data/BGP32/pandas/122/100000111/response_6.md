### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the attributes `axes` and `blocks` of two instances and returns `True` if they are equal. It uses a helper function `canonicalize` to sort and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison of `axes` should be straightforward, as it checks if the lengths are equal and if all elements are equal.
2. The comparison of `blocks` involves sorting the blocks based on a canonical order, but this ordering technique could be problematic in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The `canonicalize` function might not uniquely identify blocks if they are identical but have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the sorting mechanism used to order the blocks. If two blocks are identical but have different locations, the current sorting mechanism might consider them unequal, leading to an incorrect result in the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the sorting mechanism, so blocks that are equivalent but have different locations are considered the same. We could incorporate a more robust comparison technique for the blocks to ensure correct equality checks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison function for blocks
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.shape == block2.values.shape and np.allclose(block1.values, block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the `canonicalize` function with `compare_blocks`, which ensures that blocks are compared based on their values rather than locations. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
