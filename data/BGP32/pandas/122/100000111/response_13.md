### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then if their blocks are equal after sorting them using a canonicalize function. The bug occurs when two identical blocks with different locations are compared, leading to an incorrect result.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function where it uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a unique identifier for each block. This method does not consider the actual values of the blocks but only their positions.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the current implementation does not consider block values, only their locations, leading to false positives in cases where two blocks with the same values but different locations are compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block values and locations in creating a unique identifier.
2. Update the sorting logic to compare blocks based on their actual values, not just locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block values and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that the sorting is based on both block values and locations, the corrected function should now provide the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
