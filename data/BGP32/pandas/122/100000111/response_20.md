### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is supposed to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which leads to incorrect comparison results.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for two `BlockManager` objects that have identical blocks with different locations. This goes against the expected behavior of returning `False` in such cases.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of sorting the blocks, use some other method to compare the blocks directly to ensure their equality.
- Drop the sorting step using the `canonicalize` function and directly compare the blocks using the `equals` method of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version directly compares the blocks for equality without sorting them based on their names and locations, thus addressing the issue reported.
