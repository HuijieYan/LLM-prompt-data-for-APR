### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed as it sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which combines data type name and the manager locations. As a result, blocks with identical data but different locations might be erroneously considered different.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function starts by comparing the axes of `self` and `other` BlockManagers. If the lengths are not equal, it returns `False`, which is correct.
2. It then checks if all axes are equal using a generator expression. If any pair of axes is not equal, it returns `False`, which is also correct.
3. The function then consolidates both `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
4. Next, it compares the number of blocks in both BlockManagers. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is correct.
5. The bug occurs during the comparison of blocks. It sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the data type name and manager locations. This sorting can lead to the wrong comparison result due to different locations.
6. If any blocks are not equal, it should return `False`, but the flawed sorting might lead to a `True` result even when blocks are not identical.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using sorting and canonicalization based on data type name and manager locations, directly compare the blocks for equality.
2. Modify the comparison logic to check each block in sequence and return `False` if any pair of blocks is not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))

``` 

This corrected version directly compares each block without sorting or modification, ensuring that the equality check is accurate despite differences in block locations.
