### Analysis
The buggy function `equals()` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block order. However, there is an issue with the comparison logic that leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios as described in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the current implementation arises from the comparison logic of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` after sorting them based on the `canonicalize` key function. The bug occurs when the blocks have the same content but different `mgr_locs` (block locations).

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the fact that the `canonicalize` function does not take into consideration the block locations (`mgr_locs`). Blocks with the same content but different locations should not be considered equal, leading to incorrect results where the function may incorrectly return `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` in the tuple used for sorting the blocks. This modification will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to include mgr_locs for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals()` function will correctly compare blocks taking into consideration both content and locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
