### Issue Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return True even when the blocks have different locations. The comparison is based on block content and not on their locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of blocks in the function `canonicalize`.
2. The final comparison of blocks in `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from sorting and comparing blocks based on content only, not considering their locations. This leads to the incorrect equality check between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison should consider both the block content and their locations to ensure correctness.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Sort the blocks based on content and location to ensure correct comparison.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the tuple for sorting.
3. Update the final equality check to compare blocks based on content and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
