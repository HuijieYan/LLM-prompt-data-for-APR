### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in a way that does not consider the block locations. This comparison can lead to `True` being returned incorrectly even if the blocks have the same data but different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on data type and location (mgr_locs) which helps in identifying blocks with the same data but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function considers both the data values and the block locations. By modifying the canonicalize function to account for block locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered to be equal. Additionally, the sorting of blocks based on this modified canonicalize function should be done before comparing the blocks in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the mgr_locs to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function should now properly compare blocks based on both data values and block locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
