### Analysis:
- The `equals` function takes two BlockManager objects (self and other) as input and compares them based on their axes and blocks.
- The main issue arises in comparing the blocks of self and other BlockManagers, where the function incorrectly considers two identical blocks with different locations as not equal.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This causes the function to consider blocks with different locations as unequal, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks based on the combination of type names and manager locations, leading to blocks with identical content but different locations being considered unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers only their content and not their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.get_values_hash())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.get_values_hash())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Changed the sorting process of blocks using a custom function `get_values_hash` that calculates a hash based on the block's contents only, discarding the location information.
- This change ensures that blocks with identical content are considered equal, irrespective of their locations.
