### Analysis
The bug in the provided function `equals` lies in the comparison logic for the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function compares the blocks without considering the fact that blocks with the same values may have different locations. This leads to incorrect true outcomes in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `equals` sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on the combination of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Since `mgr_locs` contains information about the block's locations, if two identical blocks are in different locations, the function incorrectly considers them different.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content instead of locations. We can update the comparison logic to ignore the block locations in determining equality. This can be achieved by comparing the content of each block solely.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sorted_block_data(blocks):
        return [(block.values, block.mgr_locs, block.dtype) for block in blocks]

    self_block_data = sorted_block_data(self.blocks)
    other_block_data = sorted_block_data(other.blocks)

    return self_block_data == other_block_data
```

This corrected version of the function does a deep comparison of the blocks' content and types to determine equality, rather than considering block locations. This updated logic ensures that the function behaves correctly for cases where the block content is identical but the locations are different.
