### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The expected input/output values provided in the GitHub issue indicate that the function may be returning incorrect results when comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may be incorrect.
2. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks may not be producing the expected results.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function compares the blocks of `self` and `other` without considering the actual values within the blocks. It relies on block types and locations for comparison, which can lead to false positives.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be based on the actual content within the blocks rather than just their types and locations. Implementing a comparison based on block values would ensure that the function correctly identifies differences between `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `equals` method now compares blocks based on their actual content using the `blocks_equal` function. This approach ensures that the function accurately determines equality between the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances.
