### Analysis
The function `equals` is expected to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The bug might occur due to the comparison of blocks with different locations.

### Identified Bug
The bug might be related to how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks for comparison. If the blocks have the same data but are in different locations, the sorting might not provide the correct comparison order.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function only considers the data type name and the location, but it does not consider the actual content of the blocks. So, blocks with the same data but different locations could be falsely identified as different, leading to a false result of the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the actual content of the blocks for comparison. By considering the content, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content and dtype for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_values(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the content (`block._get_values()`) and dtype for comparison. This modification ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
