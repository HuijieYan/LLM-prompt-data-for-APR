### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises when comparing blocks because it sorts the blocks based on block dtype name and manager locations, which can lead to the wrong result when identical blocks have different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on dtype name and manager locations.
2. Comparison of sorted blocks using the `equals` method of each block.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, leading to different orderings even for identical blocks with different locations. Consequently, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` due to the different block ordering.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on their content rather than their ordering. We can achieve this by directly comparing each block with the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Directly compare blocks based on their content
    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing each block with its corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`, we ensure that the comparison is based on block content rather than their order, which fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
