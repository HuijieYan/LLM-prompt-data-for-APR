### Analysis and Bug Explanation
The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` by first checking if their axes are of the same length. If they are, it proceeds to check if all the corresponding axes elements are equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks within the BlockManagers and compares if the number of blocks is the same. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks within the BlockManagers for equality.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This indicates that the comparison mechanism is not correctly handling identical blocks with distinct locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location
The bug likely arises from the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects, specifically in the `equals` function where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting mechanism might not effectively distinguish between blocks with identical values but different locations.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function handles identical blocks with different locations correctly, we need to modify the comparison mechanism for the blocks. Instead of relying solely on the block's type and manager locations, the comparison should directly compare the block values to determine equality. This change should address the reported issue and provide the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare blocks for equality based on values
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function now directly compares the block values for equality instead of relying on a sorting mechanism based on type and location. This adjustment should address the reported bug and provide the expected output for the provided test cases.
