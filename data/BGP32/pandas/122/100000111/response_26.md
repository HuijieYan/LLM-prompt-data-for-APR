### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are considered equal. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function is incorrectly returning `True` in certain cases where it should be `False`.

### Potential Errors:
1. Comparing the equality of block types and locations can be prone to errors if not handled correctly.
2. Block canonicalization may not be accurately comparing the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to stem from the method used to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on their type name and location, but there might be scenarios where the same blocks are detected as different due to their location differences. This incorrect comparison logic leads to the function erroneously determining equality when it should not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison method for the blocks needs to be revised to consider equality based on more suitable criteria, possibly focusing on the block's content rather than its position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version directly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects for equality, ensuring that the comparison is based on content rather than block locations. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output as specified.
