### Analysis and Bug Identification

The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises when comparing blocks that have different locations but contain identical data, leading to a false positive result. This issue violates the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

The problematic part of the function is the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Since the blocks can have different locations yet contain the same data, the current comparison method is flawed.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `equals` function uses block location as a criterion for comparison. When blocks have the same content but different locations, they are considered unequal due to the sorting based on location, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the comparison method of blocks. Instead of sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality. This approach ensures that blocks with identical data are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Bug-Fixed Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual content of blocks using the `equals` method, we ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the data regardless of block locations. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and meet the expected input/output values specified.
