### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks if the axes are equal, if the blocks' lengths are the same, and then sorts and compares the blocks themselves.
2. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug likely occurs in the `canonicalize` function, where blocks are sorted based on block type and `mgr_locs`. If blocks with the same content are in different locations, they might not be recognized as equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on content rather than location.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of sorting blocks based on `mgr_locs`, we can compare blocks directly using their content.
2. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to return a hash of block content for comparison.
3. By comparing blocks based on content, we ensure that identical blocks are recognized as equal regardless of their locations.
4. We need to update the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks by content and modify the comparison logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the equals function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to compare block content

    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks based on content and return the correct equality status according to the expected input/output values and the reported GitHub issue.
