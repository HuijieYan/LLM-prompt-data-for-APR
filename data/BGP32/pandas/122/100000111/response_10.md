### Analysis and Explanation:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes' length is equal and if all corresponding axes are equal. Then, it proceeds to compare the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance.
2. The bug arises in the comparison of blocks because the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting can lead to a false positive result in the comparison if blocks have the same content but different locations.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations. This behavior contradicts the expected output and the defined behavior of the `equals` function for `BlockManager`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their dtype name and locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks primarily based on their content rather than their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. By comparing blocks' content, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function removes the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` and directly compares the blocks' equality based on their content. This modification ensures that the `equals` function behaves as expected and resolves the issue raised on GitHub regarding identical blocks with different locations.
