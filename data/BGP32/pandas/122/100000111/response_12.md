### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, there is a bug in the canonicalization process of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons and potentially returning a false positive equality result.

### Identified Error Location
The error lies in the `canonicalize` function where the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is used incorrectly. This leads to incorrect sorting of the blocks, which results in a faulty comparison.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to mistakenly consider blocks with different locations to be equal, leading to a wrong equality comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the `mgr_locs` attribute appropriately. By adjusting the sorting mechanism, we can ensure correct comparison and equality evaluation between the blocks.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.index.as_slice(), block.is_consolidated)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the `dtype.name`, `block.index.as_slice()`, and `block.is_consolidated` attributes to ensure an accurate sorting of the blocks. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide correct equality evaluation for the `BlockManager` instances.
