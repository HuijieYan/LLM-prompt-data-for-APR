### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the issue reported on GitHub states that the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations. The issue highlights a failure in the expected output for the given test case.

### Bug:
The bug arises from comparing blocks based on their order, which disregards the locations of the blocks. The function currently uses the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on the datatype name and memory locations, but this does not guarantee the correct comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual values and not just the order of blocks. We can achieve this by comparing block values directly instead of relying on their positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` objects from both `BlockManager` instances without changing their order. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual block data rather than their positions.
