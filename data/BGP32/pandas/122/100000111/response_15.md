### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is supposed to compare two BlockManagers based on their axes, blocks, and block contents.
- The issue on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which is a bug.
- The code needs to compare the blocks in a way that considers the actual content and not just the locations.

### Identified Error:
- The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the block's data type name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which might not capture the actual content accurately for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused because the canonicalization of blocks based on data type name and location might not reflect the actual content of the blocks. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of sorting the blocks based on dtype and locations, we should directly compare the content of each block to ensure accurate equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

This corrected version bypasses the sorting based on dtype and locations and directly compares the content of each block for accurate equality comparison.
