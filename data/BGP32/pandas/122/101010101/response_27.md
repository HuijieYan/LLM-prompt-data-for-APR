### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in pandas that is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
   
2. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. When comparing the blocks, the order of the blocks is not taken into account properly, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug occurs because the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted by the `canonicalize` function, which uses a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to sort the blocks. The issue arises when blocks are sorted based on `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which leads to incorrect block comparison.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that block comparison takes place based on the block's content and not on its location. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` while sorting the blocks.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix involves modifying the `canonicalize` function to only return `block.dtype.name` and sorting the blocks based on it. This change ensures that blocks are correctly compared by their data type and not their locations.
