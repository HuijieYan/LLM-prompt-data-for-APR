### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) with columns in different order and values. Then, it asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that `True is False`.
4. From the expected case, we can see that the buggy function compares `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after sorting them based on a custom key function `canonicalize`.
5. The bug arises because the custom sorting function `canonicalize` uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for sorting, which leads to an incorrect comparison when the DataFrame columns are in a different order.

### Bug:
The bug in the function arises due to the `canonicalize` function using information of the block's locations `mgr_locs` for sorting. When the DataFrame columns are in a different order, this sorting strategy leads to incorrect block comparisons.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `block.dtype.name` for sorting, as the block's type and data type are enough to determine equality. This change will disregard the column location information, which is causing the incorrect comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using only dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects based on block types only, ignoring column location information. This change will address the bug and make the function return the expected results.
