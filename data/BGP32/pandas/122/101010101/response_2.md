### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The failing test is comparing two dataframes that have columns in different orders, expecting them to not be equal.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the columns are in a different order. Since the `.equals` method of `pandas` does not handle this situation, the custom `equals` method in `BlockManager` must account for it.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks of `self` and `other` by both the dtype name and the manager locations to ensure columns match even if they are in different orders.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both the data type name and manager locations in `canonicalize`, we can ensure that columns are matched properly even if they are in different orders. This corrected version should pass the failing test and cover the edge case of different column orders.
