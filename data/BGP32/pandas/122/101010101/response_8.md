### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` defined in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality based on certain conditions related to their axes and blocks.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, which implies that the buggy function is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This discrepancy is likely due to an issue in comparing the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

The potential error locations in the function include:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes length.
2. Incorrect comparison of individual axes using `ax1.equals(ax2)`.
3. Sorting of blocks for comparison based on `canonicalize` function.
4. Incorrect comparison of individual blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `self.axes` and `other.axes` are fetched correctly, and their length comparison is done accurately. However, the comparison of individual axes using `ax1.equals(ax2)` might be causing the bug.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function may not be handling the blocks correctly with respect to their order, leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. The final comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` may not be working as intended, resulting in the unexpected `True` return.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the comparison of individual axes is done correctly to avoid any faulty equality checks.
2. Check the `canonicalize` function to guarantee that it properly handles different block types for sorting.
3. Verify the comparison of individual blocks is accurate to correctly determine equality between the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparisons of axes, blocks, and their types are done accurately, maintaining consistency in determining the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
