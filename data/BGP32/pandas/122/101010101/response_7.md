### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The comparison logic is sorting the blocks based on their type name and then `mgr_locs`, but the `canonicalize` function may not be generating unique values to distinguish blocks properly during sorting, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates unique values for each block for correct sorting.
5. I will update the `canonicalize` function to include more unique properties of the block for proper distinction.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions in the class are left unchanged
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Update canonicalize function to have more unique properties for blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.values.tostring())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's type name and values (converted to a string), we ensure that each block is uniquely identified during sorting. This should correct the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and address the failing test case.
