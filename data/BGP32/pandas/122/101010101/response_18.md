### Error Analysis:
1. In the buggy function, there is an overwriting of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. This overwriting results in a conflict when checking equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The error message indicates that the equality check is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The expected behavior is that the function should correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the equality check logic is correct and compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
5. The correct version of the function should only contain the logic to compare axes and blocks, returning `False` early if any of the conditions fail.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the function correctly compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances and handles the check for equality appropriately.
