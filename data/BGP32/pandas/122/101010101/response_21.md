### Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` function inside the `BlockManager` class. This function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. This means that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
- The function checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on their type and location, and finally compares each block.
- The cause of the bug may be related to the sorting or comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug
The bug seems to be in the way the function is comparing the blocks from two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic may not correctly handle the case where the values within the blocks are in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the ordering and comparison logic for the blocks are consistent and handle edge cases.
2. Verify that the comparison between blocks is done correctly.
3. Consider additional tests with different arrangements of data within the blocks to ensure the correct handling of various scenarios.

### Corrected Version

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), str(type(block)))
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now includes the `mgr_locs` for consistent ordering.
- When sorting blocks, we use both `mgr_locs` and the type of the block to ensure a more comprehensive comparison.
- The blocks are compared using the `equals` method of each block.

This corrected version should handle different scenarios related to block ordering within `BlockManager` instances.
