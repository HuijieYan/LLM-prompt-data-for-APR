### Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the comparison of two `DataFrame` instances fails, resulting in the assertion error.
- The bug likely occurs due to a mismatch in the content of the two `DataFrame` instances being compared.
- The `canonicalize` function generates a key for sorting the blocks based on the data type name and manager locations.
- The bug may be related to incorrect sorting of blocks before comparison.

### Bug Identification
- The bug is likely in the sorting step where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists are generated and compared.
- The issue may arise from incorrect canonicalization of blocks before sorting.
- The error message shows that the `DataFrame.equals` method returns True unexpectedly.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to the mismatch in the content of the `DataFrame` instances.
- The bug causes the `DataFrame.equals` method to return True incorrectly, leading to the assertion error.

### Suggested Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are correctly sorted and compared. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent key for sorting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize function assigning arbitrary randomness to columns
    def canonicalize(block):
        return id(block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses the `id` of the block to generate a key, ensuring consistent sorting for comparison. This approach avoids the previous issue that led to the incorrect comparison of `DataFrame` instances.
