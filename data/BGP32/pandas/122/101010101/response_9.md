### Analysis:
1. The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them and compares the blocks they contain. The error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of the expected `False`.
   
2. The bug is likely to be in the comparison logic in the buggy function. The function compares the blocks using a `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. If the dtype names are different, the comparison may fail even if the blocks are equal.

3. The bug most likely arises from how the blocks are canonicalized and sorted for comparison. The `canonicalize` function only considers the dtype name and the array of manager locations, which may lead to incorrect comparisons for different data types.

4. To fix the bug, we need to consider additional factors when sorting the blocks for comparison. Instead of solely relying on the dtype name and manager locations, we can also include the shape and values of the blocks to ensure a more robust comparison.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape, block.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes additional parameters in the `canonicalize` function such as the shape and values of the blocks. These additional parameters will ensure a more thorough comparison between the blocks, fixing the bug that caused the incorrect result in the failing test.
