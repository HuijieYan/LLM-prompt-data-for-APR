### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances by their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the method is not returning the expected value, leading to a failing test where two DataFrames that are not equal are incorrectly considered equal.

### Bug
The bug in the function arises from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. Each block is sorted based on a tuple containing the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` information. The bug is likely caused by the way the canonicalization is performed, leading to incorrect ordering of blocks for comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization process properly considers the dtype name and `mgr_locs` information to correctly compare and sort the blocks. By fixing the sorting logic, we can ensure that equal blocks are properly detected.

### Corrected code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to convert the dtype and mgr_locs to strings before comparing them, we ensure a proper sort order based on their string representations. This correction should address the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
