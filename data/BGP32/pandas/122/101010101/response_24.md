The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different values and types for the columns 'a' and 'b'. The bug does not correctly identify the inequality between the two DataFrames, leading to a failed test due to incorrect comparison logic.

The bug occurs in the `equals` function's implementation where it tries to compare the blocks of the two BlockManagers (`self` and `other`) without considering the actual content and data types of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the individual blocks in the `equals` function. This involves comparing the values within each block as well as their data types. We should also handle cases where the two BlockManagers have different structures and contents.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
    
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
    
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.tostring(), block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function compares the values, data types, and locations of each block within the two BlockManagers, ensuring a more accurate assessment of their equality. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
