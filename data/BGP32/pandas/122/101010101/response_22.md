### Analysis:
1. The existing `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class checks for equality between two instances by comparing their axes, blocks, and block attributes.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of two instances first, followed by comparing the blocks for equality.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returned `True is False`.
4. The bug likely lies in the comparison part of the function where the blocks are sorted and then compared. The values in the data frames are of different types, causing the comparison to fail.
5. To fix this, we need to sort and compare the blocks based on the actual values in them rather than relying on the data type alone.

### Solution:
To correct the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to extract the actual data values from the blocks instead of just the data type. This change will ensure that the comparison considers the values within the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the values in the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual values in the blocks instead of just their data type, we ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks for equality. This correction should resolve the issue raised by the failing test case.
