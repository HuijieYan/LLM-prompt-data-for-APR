### Analysis:
- The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them in place, and finally comparing the blocks they contain. 
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, suggesting that the function is not returning the expected result when comparing two dataframes.
- The expected input and output values provide the correct values and types for different variables involved in the function.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect equality comparison being performed in the buggy function. The function returns `True` if the two `BlockManager` objects are equal, which is the opposite of what is expected. This leads to the failing test case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to return `False` when the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal, and `True` when they are equal.

### Corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the return statement in the function to return `True` only when the two `BlockManager` objects are equal, the bug is fixed.
