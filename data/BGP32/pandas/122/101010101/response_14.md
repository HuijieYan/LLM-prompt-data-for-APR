### Analysis
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is named `equals` and is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances fails, indicating that the `equals` method is not working as expected.
3. The bug likely originates from the comparison logic within the function. The function compares axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances using their elements, which causes the test case to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly compare the blocks for equality and ensure that the comparison considers the actual data in the `DataFrame` instances.
5. We will update the `equals` method to compare the columns (represented by the block data) of both `BlockManager` instances to ensure the correctness of the equality check.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in self and other
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False

        # Compare the block data values for equality
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In the corrected version:
- We first compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, followed by the blocks to ensure compatibility.
- We iterate through each block in both instances and compare their shape. If the shapes do not match, we return `False`.
- We then compare the data values of the blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure equality.
- If all comparisons pass, we return `True` indicating that the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
