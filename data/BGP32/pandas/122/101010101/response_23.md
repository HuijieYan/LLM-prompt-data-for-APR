### Analyzing the buggy function

**Issue:**
The buggy function is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) based on their blocks, but the comparison is failing in a test scenario where the columns of two DataFrames are transposed. The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is sorting blocks based on their data types and locations, leading to an incorrect comparison.

**Bug Location:**
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Specifically, the bug arises when sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` using the `canonicalize` function.

**Cause of the Bug:**
When comparing two `BlockManager` objects, the buggy function sorts their blocks based on a combination of data type name and manager locations. This approach fails when the columns of the DataFrames are transposed because the comparison should not depend on the order of blocks based on data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for the blocks. Instead of relying on data types and manager locations, the comparison should be solely based on the content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def content_equals(block1, block2):
            return block1.values.equals(block2.values)
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(
            content_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function modifies the way the blocks are compared. Instead of sorting based on data types and locations, it directly compares the values of the blocks. This change ensures that the comparison is solely based on the content of the blocks, resolving the bug related to transposed DataFrame columns.
