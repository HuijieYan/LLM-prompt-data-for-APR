### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is a method within the `BlockManager` class in Pandas. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises when comparing the two blocks since the function fails to properly handle the scenario where the elements within each block are in a different order.

The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes that have their columns inverted.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The bug might be related to how blocks are sorted before comparison.
2. The bug could arise from the way blocks are compared element-wise.
3. The treatment of indices and axes might not consider different orders of elements within blocks.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug occurs due to the assumption that sorting blocks by a canonical key (in this case, datatype and location within the manager) is sufficient to determine equality. However, this assumption does not consider that two blocks with the same datatype and location but different values can exist, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we can augment the comparison logic to not only consider block properties for equality but also compare block values directly. This approach ensures a more robust check for equality by comparing the actual contents of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the values of the blocks using the `equals` method's values attribute. This way, we ensure that the contents of the blocks are compared for equality rather than relying solely on sorting by a canonical key.
