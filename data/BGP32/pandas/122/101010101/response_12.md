### Analysis
The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises when comparing DataFrame blocks if they are not in the same order due to a sorting method in the function. This leads to the comparison failing even if the contents are the same.

### Bug
The bug occurs due to the sorting mechanism used in the function to canonicalize block order. When comparing blocks, the function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting prevents the comparison from working correctly when the DataFrame blocks have different orders.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the sorting logic that disrupts the comparison by block order. We should directly compare the blocks in the function without any prior sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the sorting logic based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the corrected function will compare the blocks directly, leading to a correct comparison result.
