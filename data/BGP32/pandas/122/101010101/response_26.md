### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class attempts to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in-place. It proceeds to compare the number of blocks they contain and sorts them for further comparison.
   
2. The failing test provides two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, each with two columns "a" and "b". The test asserts that `df1` does not equal `df2`, which is expected because the values in the columns are of different types.

### Bug location:
The bug is happening because the `equals()` function is comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances without considering the content of each block. It should check the contents of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing the blocks using the `equals()` method without considering the actual data stored in the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on the type name and then on the locations, which is insufficient for comparing the contents.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize()` function to also include the block contents for each block.
2. Update the comparison logic within the `equals()` function to compare block values in addition to block types and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Add this corrected version to the class definition

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
  
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version includes a modification to the `canonicalize()` function to also extract the block values. This change allows for a comprehensive comparison between blocks in the `BlockManager` instances.
