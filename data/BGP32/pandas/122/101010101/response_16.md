### Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. It compares the axes and blocks of both objects.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. This suggests that the buggy function is not working as expected.
3. The buggy function compares the axes of both `BlockManager` objects and then tries to sort and compare the blocks. Any issues with axis comparison or block sorting could lead to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes are properly compared and that the blocks are correctly sorted for comparison.
5. Since the bug seems to be related to incorrect sorting of blocks during comparison, we need to ensure that the sorting logic based on `canonicalize` function works correctly.

### Bug Fix
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation
1. I corrected the `canonicalize` function to use the block's class name and slice representation from `mgr_locs` for sorting blocks.
2. By sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the corrected `canonicalize` function, the comparison is done with properly ordered blocks.
3. This update ensures that the comparison considers both block types and locations, which should address the bug where blocks were not correctly compared.
