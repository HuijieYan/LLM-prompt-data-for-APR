### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing `assert True is False`. This suggests that the `equals` function is not working as expected. 

Looking at the buggy function, the issue seems to stem from the comparison of two DataFrames (represented by `BlockManager` objects) where the columns have different data types. The buggy function does not handle this case correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison of blocks within DataFrames. When two blocks with different datatypes are compared, the function fails to handle them appropriately, causing the equality check to return an incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly handle cases where blocks have different data types. We can do this by improving the comparison logic to consider data type compatibility during the block comparison process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Define a new function for comparing blocks with handling different datatypes
        def block_equals(block1, block2):
            if block1.shape != block2.shape or block1.values.dtype != block2.values.dtype:
                return False
            return block1.equals(block2)

        # canonicalize block order, enhancing the block comparison with block_equals function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block_equals(block, oblock) 
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function enhances the block comparison process by introducing a `block_equals` function that checks both shape and data type compatibility before calling the original `equals` method. This modification should enable correct comparisons between blocks with different data types, resolving the bug identified.
