### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances by examining their axes, blocks, and block order. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances fails even when they are not equal. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the blocks within each `BlockManager`.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The comparison based on axes might not be taking into account the data within the blocks.
2. The way blocks are sorted and compared might be incorrect.
3. The sorting criteria based on block type and location might not be unique enough to differentiate blocks properly.

### Explaining the bug

The bug likely arises from the sorting of blocks in the `BlockManager`. The function compares blocks without taking their actual data into consideration. In the failing test, the contents of the data frames within blocks are in different orders, making the comparison fail even though they have the same axes and block structure.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the comparison should ensure that not only the block types and locations are considered but also the actual data within those blocks. By accounting for the actual data in the comparison, the function can accurately determine if two `BlockManagers` are equal or not.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.as_array().tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.as_array().tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their actual data values (using `block.values`) and converting them to a list for comparison, the corrected function will accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
