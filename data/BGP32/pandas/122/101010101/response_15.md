### Analysis:
- The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks for equality.
- The `equals` function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal. Then it consolidates the blocks in both objects and checks if the number of blocks is equal. Finally, it sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs and compares them one by one.
- The error message indicates that the test case expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it incorrectly returned `True`.
- There seems to be an issue with the comparison logic of the blocks in the buggy function, leading to the incorrect result.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks after sorting them based on dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue might arise from the way `block.equals(oblock)` is implemented.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should check if the dtype and mgr_locs of each block are equal between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are comparing the blocks using the `get_values().dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes to ensure a proper comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
