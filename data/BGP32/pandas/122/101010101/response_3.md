### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects and their blocks based on axes, block lengths, and block content.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`, which means the function is not providing the correct output.
3. The expected values for input parameters such as `self.axes`, `self`, `other.axes`, and `other` are given along with the expected values for variables right before the return.
4. The bug may arise from incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
   
### Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect sorting of blocks to compare. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize`, where the `mgr_locs` attribute is used without proper correspondence, leading to incorrect block comparison.

### Fix:
In order to fix the issue, we need to update the `canonicalize` function within the buggy function to correctly consider the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block for comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name and mgr_locs for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this correction, the comparison and sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` should work correctly, resolving the bug.
