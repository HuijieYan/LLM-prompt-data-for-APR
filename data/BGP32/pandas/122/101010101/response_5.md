### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. This suggests that the buggy function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the function. The sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the block order might be incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately, considering the type name and locations of the blocks.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Use type name for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to use the type name for comparison, we ensure that blocks are sorted correctly for comparison. This fix should address the incorrect return value issue and make the function behave as expected.
