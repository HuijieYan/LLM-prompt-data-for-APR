### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It compares their axes, consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks, and then checks if each block is equal between the two `BlockManager` objects.
   
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Bug
The bug in the function is likely related to the comparison of the data within the blocks. Since the test case expects the two dataframes (`df1` and `df2`) to be unequal, the function should have returned `False` after comparison. The bug may stem from the incorrect comparison of blocks within the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects are correctly compared. We should verify each block's content for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```  

By sorting the blocks based on their values and locations, we ensure a more accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects. This corrected version should now return `False` when the dataframes are not equal.
