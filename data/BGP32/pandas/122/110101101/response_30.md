### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The function currently checks if the blocks of the two instances are equal by comparing them one by one, but it fails to consider the specific order of the blocks.

In the failing test, two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` are created with different data types for the columns. When the `equals` method is called on these two instances, the function incorrectly returns `True` because it does not properly compare the blocks in the correct order, leading to the test failing as it expects `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances based on a canonicalization method that considers both the block's data type and the `mgr_locs` (block placement). By sorting the blocks in the same order, we can ensure a proper comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization method that considers both the data type and the block placement, the corrected `equals` method will now properly compare the blocks in the same order, fixing the bug in the comparison logic.
