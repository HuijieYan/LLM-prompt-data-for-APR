### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison logic between the blocks. The code is attempting to sort and compare blocks based on their dtype and manager locations, but due to incorrect sorting and comparison logic, the function fails to correctly identify the blocks as equal or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks in the `equals` method. We should properly compare the block structures and their contents to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.iget_block_type(),
            hash(block.values.values.tobytes()),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. This should resolve the failing test case mentioned.
