### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` fails in the provided test case because it incorrectly compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances while not considering the order of the blocks. The function erroneously sorts the blocks based on an unreliable key `canonicalize`, leading to a mismatch when comparing the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To rectify this bug, we need to ensure that we compare the blocks accurately without depending on sorting based on unreliable criteria. One approach could be to directly compare the blocks without reordering them. This way, we can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `equals()` function, we ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done accurately without any unnecessary reordering or sorting. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
