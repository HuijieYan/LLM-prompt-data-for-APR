### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between blocks in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are the same, then proceeds to compare the axes themselves. However, it then sorts the blocks in each `BlockManager` object based on a `canonicalize` function that uses the block's dtype name and manager locations, which may not be consistent between the two objects. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparison of blocks, causing the function to return a wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects, they are compared directly without sorting. This will prevent any misalignment due to sorting based on dtype and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the function directly compares the blocks without sorting, ensuring a correct comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
