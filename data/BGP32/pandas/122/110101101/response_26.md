The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the way blocks are compared and sorted using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs does not guarantee the correct comparison between blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly. One way to achieve this is by comparing blocks based on their actual values rather than their characteristics like dtype and mgr_locs.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function bypasses the sorting based on block characteristics and directly compares the blocks' values, ensuring a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.

By using this corrected function, the failing test should now pass successfully.
