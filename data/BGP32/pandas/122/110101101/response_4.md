### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting of blocks based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. The issue arises when sorting blocks due to the differences in block order between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` even when the blocks themselves are equivalent. This causes the comparison to fail even if the blocks contain the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing the blocks based on their content rather than their order. One approach is to directly compare blocks without sorting them based on the dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks without sorting them, ensuring that the comparison is based on content rather than order.
