### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize`, which calculates a tuple based on the block's dtype name and manager locations. However, the bug arises from the usage of `as_array.tolist()` which converts the manager locations to a list incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to correctly handle the manager locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Rewrite the `canonicalize` function to generate a tuple with the dtype name and manager locations.
2. Update the sorting of blocks using the corrected `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to correctly generate a tuple with the dtype name and manager locations as a tuple, the bug should be fixed, and the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
