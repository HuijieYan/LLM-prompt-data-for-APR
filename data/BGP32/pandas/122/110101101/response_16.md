### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class occurs due to the comparison logic of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on their type names and positions, but the comparison itself is incorrect, leading to false negatives when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic between the blocks of `self` and `other`. We should compare the blocks based on their actual values rather than just their positions and types.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        for block_label in self_blocks:
            if block_label not in other_blocks:
                return False
            if not self_blocks[block_label].equals(other_blocks[block_label]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

### Testing the Fix:
The corrected version of the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks based on their actual data values, ensuring that the comparison is accurate. This should make the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
