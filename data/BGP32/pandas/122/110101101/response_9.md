### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from an incorrect comparison of BlockManager objects. The function compares the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects, but the comparison logic does not handle the case where the order of axes or blocks is different between the two objects. This results in false negatives in the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider all possible permutations of axes and blocks. This can be achieved by sorting the axes and blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function introduces a `canonicalize` function that generates a consistent representation of blocks. By sorting the blocks based on this canonical representation, the function ensures a proper comparison between BlockManager objects.
