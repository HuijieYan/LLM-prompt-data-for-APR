### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by comparing the blocks in a non-deterministic order. The sort operation on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not considering the block order correctly based on type name and `mgr_locs` because unconsolidated blocks are not being handled properly. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the function returning the wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a way that considers type name and `mgr_locs` correctly. By properly handling unconsolidated blocks during the sorting process, we can compare the blocks in a deterministic order and make the function return the correct result.

            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider `block.__class__.__name__` instead of `block.dtype.name`, we can ensure that blocks are sorted based on their type names. This correction will lead to deterministic comparisons, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
