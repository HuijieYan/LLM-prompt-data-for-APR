### Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is done using the `equals` method of each block, but the blocks are being sorted before the comparison based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, `mgr_locs` is being converted to a list with `.tolist()` which causes an issue when comparing because the comparison is done with lists which can differ in memory location, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to correctly compare the `mgr_locs` of the blocks without converting it to a list. This can be achieved by comparing the `mgr_locs` as numpy arrays directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the function correctly compares the blocks based on their `mgr_locs` using `tobytes()` instead of `tolist()`. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the `mgr_locs` array rather than its memory location.
