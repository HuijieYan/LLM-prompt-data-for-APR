The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the improper comparison of blocks. The function compares blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it fails to consider the actual values within the blocks during the comparison.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison logic to compare the values of the blocks as well. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared not just based on type and manager locations, but also includes the comparison of their values. This change should address the issue observed in the failing test case mentioned above.

Once you replace the buggy function with the corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
