### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class fails to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. The issue lies in the block comparison logic, where it sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

1. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` are two `DataFrames` with mixed dtype columns. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, it should return `False` because the columns have different dtypes in a different order.

2. The buggy function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, causing it to incorrectly compare the blocks between `self` and `other`. This leads to the function returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to re-implement the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, we should compare them directly based on column values to ensure correct comparison results.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(self.get(label), other.get(label), check_dtype=False) for label in self.axes[0])

```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks using `assert_frame_equal` from the pandas testing module, which compares the values of a DataFrame without considering the order or dtype of the columns. This ensures that the comparison logic is correct and the function should now pass the failing test case provided above.
