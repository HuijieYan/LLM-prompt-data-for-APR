The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks in different orders, leading to incorrect results. To address this, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparison.

1. Analyzing the buggy function:
- The `equals` function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The bug arises from comparing blocks without enforcing a consistent order.
- The function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` tuple before comparison.

2. Error location:
The error lies in the sorting process of the blocks before comparison.

3. Cause of the bug:
The current implementation does not guarantee consistent block order for comparison, leading to incorrect equality checks when comparing `BlockManager` instances.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` consistently before iterating over them for comparison. We should sort them based on a tuple combining the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to ensure a deterministic order.

5. Corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly before the comparison, fixing the bug in the equality check. This should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
