### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers without considering the block ordering. The function directly compares the blocks based on sorting by block types and `mgr_locs`, which may result in incorrect comparisons, especially when block ordering is significant (e.g., Categorical blocks).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the `self` and `other` BlockManagers is done correctly. Instead of sorting the blocks based on their types and `mgr_locs`, we should iterate over the blocks in order and compare them individually.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks individually without sorting
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the above correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers without introducing sorting biases, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
