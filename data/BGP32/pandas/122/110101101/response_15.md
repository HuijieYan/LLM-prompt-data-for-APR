### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The function is incorrectly comparing the blocks inside the `BlockManager`. The comparison logic is flawed, resulting in a wrong evaluation of the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

The issue arises from the sorting of the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The bug occurs because the representation of `mgr_locs` as a list is not a reliable way to compare blocks. Instead, a comparison based on the actual placement is necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to use the actual block placement information for comparison. This change will ensure that the `equals` function can correctly determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their block composition.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)  # Update to use actual placement information

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on the block structure and placements. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
