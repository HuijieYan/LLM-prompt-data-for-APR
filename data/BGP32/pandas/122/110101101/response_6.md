The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the block sorting using the `canonicalize` function. The bug is leading to incorrect comparison results, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done correctly. One approach is to sort the blocks based on both the dtype name and the block values. We can achieve this by updating the `canonicalize` function and sorting logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This version fixes the issue by sorting the blocks based on the combination of block values and dtype name.

After applying this fix, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should now pass as the comparison between `df1` and `df2` will return `False` as expected.
