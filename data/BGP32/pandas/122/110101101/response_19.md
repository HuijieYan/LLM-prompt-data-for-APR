### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` arrays using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is meant to create a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` of a block. However, the `mgr_locs` variable is accessed incorrectly as an attribute in the `canonicalize` function which leads to a `AttributeError` when trying to access `mgr_locs` from a block.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block in the `canonicalize` function. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for the block.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # other methods of the BlockManager class are kept as they are

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly sort the blocks based on the type name and the `mgr_locs` as a list, fixing the bug.
