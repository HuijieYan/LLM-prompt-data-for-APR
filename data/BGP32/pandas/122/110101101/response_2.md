### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from mismatched blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The current implementation fails to compare the blocks correctly due to improper sorting based on block type and location. This results in a false negative when comparing two DataFrames for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self` and `other` BlockManagers are correctly aligned and compared. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on both the block type and the manager locations before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both block type and manager locations before comparing them, this corrected version of the `equals` function will now correctly determine if two BlockManagers are equal, addressing the bug identified.
