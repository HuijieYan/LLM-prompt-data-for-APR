### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method arises from a mismatch in the block order comparison. The sorting logic based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` might be incorrect when comparing different types of blocks within the `BlockManager`. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the method failing to determine equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in the `equals` method to ensure that blocks are compared in a consistent and correct manner, considering the block type and location. We need to compare blocks based on their type and location within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a key function for sorting blocks
    def block_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adjusting the sorting key to consider the block type and location, we can address the bug and ensure that the `equals` method correctly determines the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
