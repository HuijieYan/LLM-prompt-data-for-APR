### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing in the test due to incorrect comparison logic when comparing two DataFrames. The issue arises from how the function sorts and compares the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting mechanism implemented in the `canonicalize` function is not handling the types correctly which results in the DataFrames being considered equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the type of each block correctly before sorting. This modification will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and allow the `equals` function to return the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block type in addition to mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now considers the type of each block to distinguish them correctly before sorting, ensuring that the DataFrames are compared properly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
