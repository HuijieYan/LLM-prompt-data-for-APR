### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks within each instance. The problem arises in the block comparison stage, where it attempts to sort the blocks based on a canonicalization function that uses the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Sorting blocks this way may not result in a correct comparison because it relies on the order of the blocks.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` are created with columns in a different order. The `equals` method should return `False` since the columns are not the same. However, the comparison in the buggy `equals` method goes beyond just comparing column names and incorrectly considers the block order, leading to the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should compare the two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and block content rather than relying on block order. We should sort the blocks by column labels before comparing them to ensure that columns are compared correctly. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
# fixed equals function
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False

    self_columns = [block.make_block_same_class(block._slice(None), self) for block in self.blocks]
    other_columns = [block.make_block_same_class(block._slice(None), other) for block in other.blocks]
    
    # sort blocks by block items
    self_columns.sort(key=lambda b: b.mgr_locs)
    other_columns.sort(key=lambda b: b.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_columns, other_columns)
    )
```

Applying this corrected version will ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the contents of two `BlockManager` instances without relying on the block order.
