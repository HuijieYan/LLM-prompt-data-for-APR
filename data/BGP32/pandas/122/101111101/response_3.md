### Bug explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the method to return `False` since the DataFrames are not equal. However, the buggy implementation does not correctly compare the elements of the DataFrames and therefore returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the two DataFrames element-wise and identifies any differences. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison is robust and accurate.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.content, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` method should now correctly identify the differences between the two DataFrames and return `False` as expected in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
