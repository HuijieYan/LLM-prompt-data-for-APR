### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple containing the dtype name and the result of calling `as_array` on `block.mgr_locs`. However, the `as_array` function should be called as a method on `block.mgr_locs`, not as if it were an attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the call to `as_array` by calling it as a method on `block.mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the correct result is obtained for creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected code calls `as_array` as a method on `block.mgr_locs`, ensuring that the correct result is obtained for creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function. This fix should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
