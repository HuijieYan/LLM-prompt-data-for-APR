### Bug Explanation
The buggy implementation of the `equals` function fails to correctly compare two BlockManagers by blocks due to wrong sorting logic. It results in the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` failing with the assertion error.

In the failing scenario described:
- The `self` BlockManager has two blocks: `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`, while the `other` BlockManager has the opposite order of blocks: `ObjectBlock` and `IntBlock`.
- The `canonicalize` function is meant to sort blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it doesn't consider the order of blocks listed in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The incorrect sorting leads to the wrong comparison, making the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion evaluate to True instead of the expected False.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the sorting logic within the `equals` function needs to be modified to correctly compare blocks across different BlockManagers. Specifically, the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be sorted based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, considering the block order presented in the BlockManager's `blocks` attribute.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By correcting the sorting mechanism and comparing blocks in the updated `equals` function, the test cases should now pass as they correctly evaluate the equivalence of the provided DataFrame objects.
