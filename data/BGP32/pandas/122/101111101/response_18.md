### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` since the two DataFrames have their columns in different orders. However, due to the buggy implementation, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

The root cause of the bug lies in how the `equals` function compares the two DataFrames. The function is comparing the blocks of the DataFrames without considering the order of the columns. This leads to a false positive comparison when the actual column order differs between the two DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function considers not only the blocks but also the order of the columns in the DataFrames. We can achieve this by modifying the comparison logic to include the column order when comparing the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), list(block.mgr_locs.index))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will now properly compare the DataFrames considering both the block content and the order of the columns. This will ensure that the failing test case will pass as expected.
