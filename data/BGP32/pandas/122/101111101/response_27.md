### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, which is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug arises from incorrectly sorting the blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before comparing them. The comparison of blocks is then done using the `equals` method, which fails due to blocks being ordered differently between `self` and `other`.

The error message states that `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly evaluates to `True` when it should be `False`. This incorrect evaluation causes the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in a consistent manner so that the blocks are compared correctly. One possible strategy is to sort the blocks based on a consistent criterion that allows for a meaningful comparison between blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def key_func(block):
        return (type(block), block.get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key_func)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key_func)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `key_func` that combines the block type and values, we ensure a consistent ordering for the comparison. This fix should address the bug and make the `equals` method work correctly for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
