### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `equals(self, other)` stems from the comparison logic between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises due to sorting the blocks based on a combination of block type name and locations, which might not be consistent between the two `BlockManager` instances. This can lead to incorrect comparison results even when the data within the blocks is the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that blocks are compared solely based on their data values and not on their internal representation. One way to achieve this is by comparing the data within each block directly, without relying on their order or specific attributes.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Rest of the class methods
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks directly without sorting or resorting
        self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
        other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
        
        return all(
            np.array_equal(block_data, other_block_data) for block_data, other_block_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
        )
```

By comparing the data values directly using `np.array_equal()`, we ensure that the comparison is solely based on the actual content of the blocks, resolving the bug that was causing incorrect results in comparisons.
