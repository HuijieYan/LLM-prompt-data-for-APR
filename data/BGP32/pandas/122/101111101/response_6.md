### Bug analysis:
The buggy function fails in comparing two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. The bug seems to be in how the blocks are being sorted before comparison. The function `canonicalize` is used to create a tuple with the block's type name and manager locations, but the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` statement seems to be incorrect. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly represents the block for comparison. Instead of using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we should directly use `mgr_locs` to sort the blocks.

### Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order using dtype name and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, the corrected `canonicalize` function directly uses the `block.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs` to sort the blocks for comparison. This change should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing test.
