### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method for each block. The bug stems from not updating the `BlockPlacement` associated with each block before the comparison. Since the blocks are sorted based on the output of the `canonicalize` function, which includes `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, any changes in `mgr_locs` before the sorting will lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block should be updated before generating the `canonicalize` output for sorting. This way, the sorting and subsequent comparison are performed correctly based on the updated `mgr_locs` values.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the bug fix applied:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    for block in self.blocks:
        block.mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs.consolidate()
    for block in other.blocks:
        block.mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs.consolidate()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `mgr_locs` of each block before sorting and comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
