### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. In the provided failing test case, `df1` and `df2` are two `DataFrame` instances with different ordering of columns. This leads to a failure in the comparison due to the way blocks are sorted in the buggy implementation.

The bug can be attributed to the sorting mechanism utilized for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` within the `equals` method. The sorting is based on the `canonicalize` function which sorts blocks using their data type name and location indices. This sorting does not take into account the actual ordering of columns in the `DataFrame`, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the sorting should be based on the column names instead of the data type name and location indices. This will ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances considers the actual column order in the `DataFrame`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.format.format)  # sort based on column names (format)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the column names (retrieved from `block.format.format`), the `equals` method will appropriately compare two `BlockManager` instances with respect to the column order in the `DataFrame`.
