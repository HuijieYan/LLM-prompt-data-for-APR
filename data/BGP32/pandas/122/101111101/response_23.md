### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function aims to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug causes the function to not correctly handle the comparison of axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.

The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` with columns in different orders and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `False`. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because it expects `True` to be `False`. This error occurs due to the buggy implementation of the `equals` function not properly comparing the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to ensure that the comparison between the axes and blocks is done correctly. Specifically, we should compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and sort their blocks based on a canonicalization function that considers both type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`, we can ensure a consistent comparison between two `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` method. This correction should allow the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to pass as expected.
