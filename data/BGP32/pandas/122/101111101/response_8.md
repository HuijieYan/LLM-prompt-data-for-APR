### Explanation:
The buggy function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects. The failing test creates two DataFrames that have different data types in corresponding columns, leading to a failed equality check.

The function iterates over the blocks present in both BlockManagers and compares them for equality. However, the sorting mechanism used to order the blocks for comparison does not consider the data type of the block. This means that blocks with different data types might be considered equal erroneously.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. We need to account for the block's data type in addition to the manager locations. This modification will ensure that blocks with different data types are not mistakenly sorted together.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering data type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
