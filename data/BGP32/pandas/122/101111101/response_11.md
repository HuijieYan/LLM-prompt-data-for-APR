### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function `equals` causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to throw an assertion error. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The issue arises due to incorrect comparisons when sorting and comparing blocks from the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The comparison of blocks should prioritize not only the dtype of the block but also the actual data within the block.
2. Blocks need to be sorted based on dtype and data, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.
3. Additional checks should be made during the block sorting for proper handling of empty blocks or blocks with different elements.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by comparing dtype and data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures accurate comparison of blocks based on dtype and data, which should resolve the failing test case.
