### 3. Explanation of the Bug

The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class. The bug arises from how the function is sorting the blocks before comparing them. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is being called improperly, resulting in an error.

In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` are DataFrames with columns swapped. When the `equals` function is called, it sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which calls `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. Since this call is incorrect, it leads to the error observed in the test output.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the way `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is being called in the `canonicalize` function. We should ensure that this call retrieves the appropriate information and does not lead to errors. By resolving this issue, the function should be able to properly compare the blocks and pass the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Correct the call to block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.flatten().tolist())  

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function includes the fix in the `canonicalize` function to properly call `block.mgr_locs.indexer.flatten().tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This change should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
