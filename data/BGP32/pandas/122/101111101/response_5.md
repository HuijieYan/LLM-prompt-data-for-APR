### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This issue stems from the sorting of blocks inside the function, which is inconsistent with the DataFrame comparison logic.

The current implementation sorts the blocks in both DataFrames based on the block type and locations, attempting to standardize the order for comparison. However, this approach does not consider the actual values stored in the blocks. This sorting mechanism causes a false positive result when comparing DataFrames with different values in the same blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between DataFrames considers the values within the blocks rather than just their types and locations. We should remove the sorting of blocks based on type and locations to accurately compare the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of equals Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary sorting of blocks and directly compares each block in the DataFrames. This approach ensures that the comparison considers the actual values within the blocks, providing an accurate result for DataFrame equality.
