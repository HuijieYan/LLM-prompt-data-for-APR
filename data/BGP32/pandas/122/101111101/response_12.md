### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) where the data types of corresponding columns are not matching. In this case, the bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with different data types in columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` considers the data types of the columns. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to also include column data types when sorting the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_dtype_counts(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the data type information in the comparison, ensuring that columns with different data types are not incorrectly marked as equal. This fix should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
