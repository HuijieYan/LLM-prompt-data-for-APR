### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the current method of comparing DataFrame blocks. The comparison relies on sorting blocks based on the combination of data type name and `mgr_locs` attribute. However, for DataFrame blocks containing different types of data (e.g., integers and strings), this sorting method can lead to incorrect comparisons and cause the `equals` function to return a wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. Instead of relying solely on data type name and `mgr_locs`, we should consider other attributes or methods to ensure a proper comparison of blocks, especially when dealing with diverse data types within the blocks.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Now, sorting blocks based on dtype and the actual data within the blocks
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected implementation, the `equals` function will now properly compare DataFrame blocks based on data type and the actual data within the blocks, ensuring more accurate comparisons. This should resolve the issue identified in the failing test.
