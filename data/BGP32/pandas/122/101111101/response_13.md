### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the function is not correctly comparing the values of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The function is sorting these blocks by their type name and location, but it is not comparing the actual values of the blocks.

Based on the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, we can see that the 'a' column of `df1` is integer type while the 'a' column of `df2` is object type. The comparison made in the buggy `equals` function does not consider this difference, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual values of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. We should consider the values within each block when determining equality, rather than just sorting by type name and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block_same_position in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        block_self, block_other = block_same_position
        if not block_self.equals(block_other):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By iterating through corresponding blocks in `self` and `other` and comparing their actual values using the `equals` method on the blocks, we ensure that the function correctly determines if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
