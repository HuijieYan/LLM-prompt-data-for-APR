### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`. However, due to the bug, the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failing test.

The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is defined and utilized to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple by accessing attributes of the `block` object. In this case, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` fails because `block` is of type `IntBlock`, and it does not have the `mgr_locs` attribute. This causes an AttributeError, preventing the function from operating correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it handles different block types gracefully. We can modify the function to check the type of the block and then generate the tuple accordingly to avoid AttributeError.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the function can correctly compare blocks of different types and attributes, as the bug arises from comparing IntBlocks with ObjectBlocks.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.itself.tolist())
    elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.itself.tolist())
    else:
        # Handle other block types
        return (str(type(block)), str(block))

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
``` 

This corrected version handles different block types appropriately in the `canonicalize` function and ensures that the comparison is done correctly. This fix should make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` pass as expected.
