The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it sorts the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, since `mgr_locs` is a mutable object and can change within the function, the sorting based on it can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the type name for sorting. This way, we avoid relying on mutable state for sorting the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only the dtype name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
