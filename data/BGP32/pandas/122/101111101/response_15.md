### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue lies in the buggy implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.

When comparing the two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`), the existing implementation sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` object before comparing them. The sorting is based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. 

However, in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the columns `'a'` and `'b'` in `df1` and `df2` are of different data types (integers and strings) and are placed in opposite positions. This results in the blocks being sorted differently in the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to a false negative in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks considers the actual column content in addition to `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data within the blocks for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After making this change, the `equals` function will consider the actual values of the blocks for sorting, providing a correct comparison that aligns with the expectations of the failing test.
