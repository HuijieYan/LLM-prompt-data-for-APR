### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue arises because the function first checks if the lengths of the axes in both instances are different, and if not, it proceeds to compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager`. However, in the block comparison step, it doesn't handle the case where the blocks may be in different orders within the `BlockManager`.

The function erroneously sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs.as_array` of the blocks, assuming that this tuple would uniquely identify a block. However, this assumption is incorrect as the order of blocks within `BlockManager` shouldn't affect the equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the contents of the `BlockManager` instances without sorting the blocks beforehand. We should compare each block in order, without assuming any specific sorting. This will ensure that the function accurately determines the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Code
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the unnecessary sorting of blocks before the comparison, the corrected function now accurately compares the contents of the `BlockManager` instances without assuming any specific block order. This fix should resolve the failing test case.
