### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `canonicalize` function using the `block.dtype.name` as the primary key, which will result in incorrect comparison in certain cases. 

In the failing test, the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have mismatched data types in columns 'a' and 'b' (integers and strings swapped), which leads to a misinterpretation in the `equals` function due to sorting by `dtype.name`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the individual data values of each block for comparison rather than just `dtype.name`. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual content of the blocks rather than just their data types.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Modify the canonicalize function to consider block values for comparison
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

# Replace the buggy equals function with the updated version
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now properly compare data blocks based on their values instead of just their data types, allowing the failing test to pass.
