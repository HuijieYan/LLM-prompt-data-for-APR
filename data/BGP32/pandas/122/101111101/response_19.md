The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison between the two DataFrames. The bug arises from the mismatch between the expected and actual column values in the DataFrames.

The current implementation of the `equals` function is comparing the DataFrames based on the ordering of the blocks, which is not the correct approach for DataFrame equality.

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify it to compare the content of the DataFrames rather than just the block order. We can achieve this by sorting the DataFrames based on the column names and then comparing the values.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_sorted = self.sort_index(axis=1)
    other_sorted = other.sort_index(axis=1)
    
    return self_sorted.equals(other_sorted)
```

With this correction, the function sorts the DataFrames based on the column names before comparing them. This ensures that even if the columns are in a different order, the function will correctly identify the DataFrames as equal if their contents match.

By implementing this fix, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
