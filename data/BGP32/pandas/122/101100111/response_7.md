### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises from the fact that, even if the axes are different between the two instances, the function continues to compare the blocks, leading to incorrect equality.
3. The bug causes the `equals` function to erroneously return `True` when comparing two `DataFrames` with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function first checks if the axes are equal before comparing the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the axes of the two instances are equal. If they are not equal, return `False` immediately.
2. If the axes are equal, then proceed to compare the blocks of the two instances.
3. By ensuring that we compare only when the axes are equal, we can fix the bug and make the function behave correctly.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
# Corrected equals function in the BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, by incorporating the above changes, the `equals` function should correctly compare two instances based on their axes and blocks, resolving the bug described.
