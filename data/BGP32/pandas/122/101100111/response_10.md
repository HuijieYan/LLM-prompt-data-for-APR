## Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function compares `self_axes` and `other_axes` to ensure they have the same length and contain equal elements. Then it consolidates the internal state of `self` and `other` using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
3. The function then checks if the number of blocks in `self` is equal to the number of blocks in `other`. If not, it returns `False`.
4. Next, the function sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` based on a `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's dtype name and manager locations.
5. Finally, the function iterates through the sorted blocks in `self` and `other` to check if they are equal using the `equals` method of the `Block` class.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function lies in the way it constructs the `canonicalize` key for sorting the blocks. The `as_array` method is incorrectly invoked on `block.mgr_locs`, causing the function to fail when comparing different blocks with the same dtype but different manager locations.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of a block. We need to access the `mgr_locs` attribute directly and not mistake it for a function call.

## Corrected Function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to only access the `mgr_locs` attribute without calling it as a function, we address the bug in the original function and ensure that blocks with the same dtype but different manager locations are correctly handled during the comparison.
