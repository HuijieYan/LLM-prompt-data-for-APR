## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by examining their axes and blocks.
2. The function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
3. The bug causes incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with different block locations but identical contents. This is due to the sorting method used, which does not account for the block locations.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison should include the block locations in addition to the block contents.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function in the buggy function to include block locations.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider both block contents and block locations for equality.

## Correction:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        ...

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function includes checking both block contents and block locations for equality when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function returns the correct result for the provided test case.
