## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the pandas package is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function checks the equality of the axes, consolidates the blocks of both objects, and then compares the blocks.
3. The bug arises because the block order is not canonicalized properly before comparison.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects them to be unequal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison returns True incorrectly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks of `self` and `other` is not implemented correctly. The current implementation only considers the dtype name and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. In case of blocks with the same dtype name but different location (`mgr_locs`), the comparison fails.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's content along with the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This way, even if the blocks have the same dtype name but different contents or locations, they will be properly compared and determined as not equal.

## Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, now considering dtype name, mgr_locs, and block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block content along with dtype name and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality and pass the failing test case.
