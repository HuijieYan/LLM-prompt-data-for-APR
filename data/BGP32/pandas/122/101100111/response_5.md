## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their attributes. The code seems to be attempting to compare the axes, blocks, and block order of the two instances. However, there are issues in the logic which cause the function to return incorrect results for the provided test case.

## Issue:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of axes in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is checking the length of the axes and comparing each axis individually using the `equals` method. However, it is missing a crucial check for the actual values of the axes, leading to incorrect results.

## Error Locations:
1. Missing comparison of axis values.
2. Inconsistent handling of block order comparison.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of axes in the `equals` function. Since the code only checks the length and the `equals` method of each axis without comparing the actual values, it fails to identify the difference in axis values, leading to an incorrect equality check.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values of the axes in addition to their lengths and the `equals` method. We also need to ensure consistent handling of block order when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

## Suggested Fix:
1. Compare the actual values of the axes along with their lengths.
2. Ensure that the block order comparison is consistent and accounts for unconsolidated blocks.
3. Update the `equals` function logic to accurately compare all relevant attributes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 is not ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By incorporating the suggested fixes in the corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now correctly compare the axes, consolidate the blocks, and ensure consistent block order comparison, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
