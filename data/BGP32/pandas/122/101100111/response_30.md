## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` defined in the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison of blocks based on `block.equals(oblock)` might not be accurate due to unconsolidated blocks.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` fails because it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The comparison of blocks after sorting them based on the block type and then locations using `canonicalize` function does not consider unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
- Ensure that the comparison considers unconsolidated blocks while sorting blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
- Modify the comparison criteria to properly handle unconsolidated blocks.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version now properly handles unconsolidated blocks during comparison and ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly considered as equal.
