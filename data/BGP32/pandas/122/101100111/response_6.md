## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects and determine if they are equal.
2. The function compares the axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves between two instances.
3. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights this incorrect behavior and expects the function to return `False` in such cases.

## Bug:
The bug is in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. Although it correctly checks the axes and the number of blocks, the sorting of blocks for comparison is not sufficient to handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers their actual contents rather than just their locations while maintaining performance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize the blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a `canonicalize` function that creates a unique representation of each block based on its content and data type for comparison. The comparison now considers the actual content of the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly identified as not equal.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue.
