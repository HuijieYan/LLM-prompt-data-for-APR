## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes, blocks, and contents. However, the bug causes incorrect comparison results, leading to the incorrect determination of equality.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes lengths without comparing the actual axes elements.
2. Sorting blocks using an incorrect key for canonicalization.
3. Incorrect comparison of blocks for equality.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` incorrectly checks for equality by comparing axes lengths and then sorting blocks based on dtype names and locations. This approach is flawed as it fails to consider the actual content of the blocks during comparison. This leads to situations where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly determined to be equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the actual content of blocks during comparison. This can be achieved by modifying the canonicalization key to include the block content. Additionally, the comparison between blocks should compare the actual block data for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` key to include the block values and modifying the block comparison logic to compare values for equality, the corrected function ensures a proper comparison between `BlockManager` instances. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to the incorrect equality determination of identical blocks with different locations.
