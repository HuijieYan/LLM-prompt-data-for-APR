## Identified Bug

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares blocks of a DataFrame based on their order, which may lead to incorrect results when the order of blocks differs, even though the blocks themselves are identical.

The issue arises from sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which considers `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. If the blocks have the same content but are in a different order within the DataFrames, the function will erroneously return `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revised to focus on the equality of the blocks themselves rather than their order within the DataFrame. We can achieve this by comparing whether the set of blocks contained in `self` is the same as in `other`.

Additionally, we should consider comparing the blocks' content rather than their locations for equivalence, as the original technique could lead to false positives.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function with the fix applied
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check if the set of blocks are identical between DataFrames
    if set(self_blocks) != set(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the content of each block for equality
    return all(
        self.block.equals(other.block) for self.block, other.block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will compare the blocks on a content basis rather than their order. This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test provided.
