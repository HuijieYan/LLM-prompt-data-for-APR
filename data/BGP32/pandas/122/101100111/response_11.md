### Analyzing the buggy function and related information

1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and block contents.
   
2. The function first compares the number of axes, then iterates through each axis and compares them using the `.equals()` method. Next, it consolidates both `self` and `other` instances in place. After that, it checks if the number of blocks in the `self` and `other` instances are equal.
   
3. The critical part of the function involves sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function that takes into account the block's data type and `mgr_locs`.

4. The failing test case (`test_dataframe_not_equal`) is designed to check if two dataframes with different column types are considered unequal, but due to the buggy behavior of the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The comparison logic in the function seems correct based on the provided description.
2. The issue may arise due to inconsistent block ordering or the way blocks are compared.
3. The `canonicalize` function's implementation could lead to incorrect sorting of blocks.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the `equals` function doesn't handle the comparison of dataframes with different column types properly. The function erroneously considers dataframes with different column types but the same values as equal due to the way it sorts and compares the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the overall block values rather than just the data type and `mgr_locs`.
2. Update the block comparison logic to ensure consistency.
3. Ensure that the function accounts for differences in data types during comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now properly accounts for the content and data type differences, ensuring that dataframes with different column types are correctly identified as unequal.
