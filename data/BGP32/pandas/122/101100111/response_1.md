## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes, blocks, and block equality.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with mismatched values and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
- The GitHub issue reports that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Bug:
- The bug lies in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. It does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.
- The comparison method `block.equals(oblock)` is insufficient for comparing block equality when the blocks have different locations.

## Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to improve the block comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where blocks have different locations but the same content.
- We should compare the actual content of the blocks and not just their memory locations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def block_equal(block, oblock):
            if block.shape != oblock.shape:
                return False
            for b, ob in zip(block.values.ravel(), oblock.values.ravel()):
                if b != ob:
                    return False
            return True

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype, block.values.tostring())  # Using block values for comparison
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Now the `equals` function compares the block contents using the `block_equal` function. This will properly handle cases where blocks have different locations but contain the same values.
