## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs due to the improper comparison of blocks and their locations while determining equality. The issue is identified in sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without taking into consideration the block locations, leading to incorrect equality assessment.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different block locations. The function fails to consider the block locations while sorting the blocks, resulting in a false positive equality check.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should take into account the block locations when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison. By considering both the block type and block locations, the function can accurately determine equality.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with adjustments to consider block locations:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations in the canonicalization process, the corrected function now properly evaluates the equality of `BlockManager` objects, addressing the bug outlined in the GitHub issue.
