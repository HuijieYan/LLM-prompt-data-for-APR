## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy part of the function is likely the comparison of blocks for equality, where it sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function before comparing them.
3. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function only takes into account the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` of the blocks. This approach may cause blocks with the same content but different locations to be considered unequal.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison needs to include the content of the blocks to consider them equal if they contain the same data regardless of their location.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to take into account the content of the blocks in addition to the dtype name and the `mgr_locs`.
2. Compare the block content for equality in addition to the dtype name and `mgr_locs` to ensure that blocks with the same data are considered equal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        content = block.values
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), content)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After this correction, the `equals` function will now consider the content of the blocks when comparing them, ensuring that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal.
