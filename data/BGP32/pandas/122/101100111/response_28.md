### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The main issue with the current implementation is the sorting of blocks before comparison. The sorting is done based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparison results, especially when blocks have identical data but different locations.
2. Sorting based on `dtype.name` and location is not the right approach for checking equality between blocks.
3. The failing test case provided clearly demonstrates the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function when comparing two `DataFrame` instances.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and block locations before comparing them. This sorting mechanism can result in blocks getting reordered incorrectly and leading to a false positive comparison result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks directly without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and locations. We should iterate over the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances and compare each block individually.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the blocks without any sorting. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared in the original order, maintaining the correctness of the equality check.

The provided corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case while satisfying the expected input/output values.
