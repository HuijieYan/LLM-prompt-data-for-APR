## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block locations. However, there are issues with how the block comparison is being conducted, resulting in incorrect outcomes.

The buggy function performs the following steps:
1. Compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects. If they differ in length, returns False.
2. Compares each axis element pairwise. If any pair is not equal, returns False.
3. Calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both objects.
4. Compares the number of blocks in both objects. If they differ, returns False.
5. Sorts the blocks based on the block's datatype and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function.
6. Compares each pair of blocks in sorted order. If any pair is not equal, returns False.

The issue arises in the block comparison step due to comparing multiple blocks rather than corresponding blocks. This leads to incorrect True returns in some cases where the blocks are not identical despite being in different locations.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by directly comparing blocks without considering their correspondence. As a result, the function incorrectly returns True even when the blocks are not identical due to different locations.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should compare corresponding blocks rather than sorting and comparing all blocks. By mapping blocks to corresponding blocks in the other `BlockManager`, accurate block equality can be determined.

## Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Create a mapping of block index to corresponding block in the other BlockManager
    self_mapping = {self_block: other_block for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)}

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare corresponding blocks based on the mapping
    return all(
        self_mapping[block].equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison will be based on corresponding blocks rather than sorted blocks from both `BlockManager` objects. This should solve the issue reported on GitHub.
