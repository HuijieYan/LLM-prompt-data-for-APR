## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes, consolidating them, sorting the blocks based on type and locations, and then comparing the blocks.
   
2. The bug arises from comparing blocks based on locations without considering the block type and content, leading to incorrect equality checks.

3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns reversed. The `equals` method incorrectly returns True due to how the blocks are compared.

4. **Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should involve not only the locations but also the content and type of the blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the content and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both content and data type of the blocks and sorting the blocks accordingly, the corrected version ensures that the comparison considers all relevant aspects of the blocks.
