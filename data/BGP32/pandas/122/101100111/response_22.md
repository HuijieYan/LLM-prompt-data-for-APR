### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The function first compares the axes of the two instances and then consolidates them in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
- After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in each instance and then sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and location to ensure consistency.
- Finally, it compares each block one by one for equality.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. It fails to check the equality of blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations but identical values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function considers the actual block data rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both instances in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to compare blocks by value rather than location
    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Sort blocks by dtype name for consistency
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda oblock: oblock.dtype.name)

    return all(block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `equals` function with the corrected version above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances.
