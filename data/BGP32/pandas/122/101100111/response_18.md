## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. When comparing the blocks, the bug arises from the fact that different blocks could have the same location, leading to incorrect equality determination.
4. The incorrect comparison strategy fails the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` by wrongly returning `True` for unequal DataFrames.

## Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the way blocks are compared in the `equals` function. Sorting blocks based solely on location is incorrect since different blocks can have the same location. Hence, the comparison needs to consider additional factors for proper equality checking.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, a new approach to comparing blocks is needed. Instead of just comparing the block locations, a combination of the block attributes like type and location should be used to ensure accurate equality checking.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected block comparison by combining type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction to the `equals` function, the equality checking between blocks will be more accurate, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.

This corrected version ensures that DataFrame comparison considers the type of blocks, block attributes, and block locations, providing a correct determination of equality.
