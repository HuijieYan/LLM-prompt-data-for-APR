The buggy function fails to compare two BlockManager instances correctly due to the way the blocks are sorted and compared. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function fails to extract the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly, resulting in sorting based solely on the dtype name.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly consider the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting process. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` in the sorting process, the corrected function should now correctly identify identical blocks based on both dtype name and location. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test provided.
