## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check for equality between two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises because the function incorrectly checks for equality based on the order of blocks, which can be different even if the contents are the same in both objects.

## Error Location:
The main issue lies in the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function based on the block's dtype name and the manager locations. This leads to incorrect comparisons of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should avoid sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. Instead, we should directly compare the blocks within the same index positions in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

## Bug-free Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
``` 

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in the same index positions and returns `True` only if all blocks are equal, providing the correct behavior for the `equals` function.
