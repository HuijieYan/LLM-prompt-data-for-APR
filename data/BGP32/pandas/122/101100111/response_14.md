The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes a false positive when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation and affects the overall functionality of pandas.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison logic of the `equals` method where it solely relies on the block order without considering the block locations. This results in a situation where DataFrames with identical blocks but at different locations erroneously return True when compared.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks (`{'a': [1, 2]}`, `{'b': ['s', 'd']}`) but are swapped. The code does not account for these swapped locations, leading to an incorrect evaluation.
- The use of the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks by type and manager locations solely based on block contents but not their respective positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic in the `equals` method by considering the block locations along with the block contents. This can be achieved by updating the `canonicalize` function to include both the block content and the manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)  # Include locations for sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function and sorting the DataFrames based on block content and location, we can ensure accurate comparison of DataFrames, thus resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
