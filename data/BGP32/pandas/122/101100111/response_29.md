### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function's goal is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug in the function arises from the comparison of blocks without considering their order.
3. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple of type name and `mgr_locs`. 
4. The bug is that it doesn't consider the actual data within the blocks during the comparison.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the comparison of two `DataFrame` objects with different data but similar structure to return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function where it sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which only considers the type name and `mgr_locs` during comparison, ignoring the actual data within the blocks. This results in incorrect comparisons and the function might wrongly return `True` for similar structured blocks with different data.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the key for comparison within blocks, which should include the metadata as well as the actual data.
2. Update the sorting mechanism for blocks to include the actual data along with the metadata.
3. Recompare the blocks considering both metadata and data to ensure accurate equality comparison.
4. Ensure that the correct blocks are compared with precise data elements during block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to consider both type name and data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Through this correction, the `equals` function will now consider both metadata and data within the blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This change ensures accurate comparisons and the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
