### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The issue described on GitHub indicates that the function is returning True when it should be returning False for two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. Lack of proper handling for the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused due to the sorting process of blocks based on the canonicalization function, `canonicalize`, which uses the block's data type name and `mgr_locs` as the sorting key. In cases where two blocks are equal but in different locations, this sorting may not work correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this bug, we can modify the sorting process to account for the exact equality of the blocks rather than relying on sorting based on data type names and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version avoids sorting the blocks based on data type names and locations, which should fix the issue reported in the GitHub post.

By applying this corrected version, the function should now return `False` as expected in the failing test case provided.
