### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class checks for equality between two instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises when comparing blocks with the same data but with different locations. This comparison should result in `False`, but due to incorrect handling of block locations, it incorrectly returns `True`.
3. The bug is reported on GitHub with a specific test case where identical blocks with different locations are erroneously considered equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison so that it considers both the block type and its locations for determining equality.

### Correction:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain unchanged
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to include the block type and its locations, the corrected version now correctly handles cases where identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal. This change aligns the comparison to the expected behavior and resolves the reported bug on GitHub.
