The buggy function has a logical flaw in the comparison of blocks. The issue arises from sorting the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. However, this sorting does not reflect the correct comparison logic required to determine if two BlockManagers are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the BlockManagers based on their actual content rather than just sorting the blocks. We can achieve this by iterating over the self.blocks and other.blocks simultaneously and checking if each corresponding block is equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
        
        return True
```

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly compare the BlockManagers based on their block content, ensuring that the equality check is performed accurately.

This correction resolves the issue reported on GitHub, ensuring that when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, the equals function correctly returns False as expected.
