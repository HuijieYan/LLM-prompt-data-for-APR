## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. The bug occurs because when comparing blocks, the function does not handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
3. In the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, it creates two `DataFrames` with the same data but different column order. The `equals` function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False` in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the actual block content rather than just the order of blocks for equality comparison. We can create a unique identifier for each block based on its content to perform a more accurate equality check.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Concatenate block contents as unique identifiers for comparison
        return hash(str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function now compares the blocks based on their content rather than just their order, ensuring a more accurate equality evaluation. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
