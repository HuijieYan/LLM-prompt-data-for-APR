### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function fails to compare the blocks correctly due to unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two `DataFrame` objects are equal, but they have different values and are expected to return `False`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with `DataFrame.equals` returning `True` even when blocks have identical values but different locations.
5. The issue is related to the incorrect canonicalization and comparison of block order within the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison of unconsolidated blocks in the `equals` function, leading to incorrect equality checks for `BlockManager` objects.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects are consolidated before comparing blocks.
2. Modify the canonicalization method to include all necessary attributes for proper block comparison.
3. Sort and compare the blocks after consolidation to ensure accurate equality checks.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing functions remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        # Consolidate blocks before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.values)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, the corrected `equals` function should properly compare `BlockManager` objects by consolidating blocks and considering all necessary attributes for accurate equality checks. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test case pass.
