## Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes, blocks, and locations. 
2. The failing test creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in columns 'a' and 'b'. It asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False.
3. The bug causes the `equals` function to return True even when the two `BlockManager` objects have different values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly identifies the differences in blocks between the two objects.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. We will modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their values rather than locations.
2. The equality comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` will be updated to compare the actual data within each block.
3. Additionally, we will remove the unnecessary consolidation of blocks before the comparison.

## Bug-fixed code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order based on values
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.values is not None:
            return tuple(block.values.flatten())
        return block
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual values instead of their locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now return the expected results in all test cases.
