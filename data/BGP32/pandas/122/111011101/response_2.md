### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The function is mistakenly comparing blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect outcomes.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` matches the number of axes in `other`.
2. Then, it compares each axis in `self` with the corresponding axis in `other`.
3. After that, it consolidates both `BlocksManager` objects in place, followed by comparing the number of blocks in both objects.
4. Next, it attempts to compare blocks by sorting them based on a canonicalized criteria (dtype name and `mgr_locs`) and then iterates to check block equality.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function where it attempts to construct a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to differentiate blocks. This approach can lead to blocks being considered unequal even if they hold the same data but have different internal details.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison criteria for blocks to ensure that blocks with the same data are considered equal. One way to achieve this is to compare blocks directly without relying on additional details such as `dtype name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality, the corrected function will now properly check if the two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their content.
