### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their `axes` are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks in a canonicalized manner. The bug seems to be related to the comparison and sorting of the blocks.

1. The primary issue seems to be with the canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The function sorts the blocks based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` (a property representing the placement of the block within the manager).

2. The buggy function fails to properly handle the case where the block's dtype name is `object`. This issue arises since the dtype name of an `object` dtype in `Block` is not comparable, leading to incorrect sorting.

3. The error message indicates that the comparison fails for DataFrame columns with different data types, causing the test to fail.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the case where the block's dtype name is `object`. 
- Ensure that the sorting of blocks considers the dtype name in a way that allows comparison for all possible dtypes.

Let's correct the bug in the provided function.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = block.dtype.name
        if dtype_name == 'object':
            # Special handling for 'object' dtype
            return ('object', id(block))
        return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction adds a specific handling for blocks with `object` dtype within the `canonicalize` function. By using the `id(block)` for blocks with an `object` dtype, we ensure that these blocks are distinguishable and correctly sorted for comparison.
