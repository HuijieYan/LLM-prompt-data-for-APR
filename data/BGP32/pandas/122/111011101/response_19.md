### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks. The issue arises because the function uses inconsistent block ordering that leads to a false positive when comparing blocks.

1. The function sorts the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on a `canonicalize` function that combines the block's dtype name and manager locations.
2. The comparison of blocks is then performed sequentially without considering the actual values within the blocks.

This leads to incorrect comparison results, as the block contents are not compared appropriately.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare the actual block values rather than just their positions. One approach is to iterate over the blocks within each `BlockManager` and compare their contents directly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare block by block
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the contents of the blocks directly, ensuring an accurate comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
