### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of both objects are of equal length and if each pair of axes is equal. Then it consolidates both objects in place and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it sorts and compares each pair of blocks in the objects.

The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it returned `True` instead. This suggests that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is incorrectly evaluating to `True` when it should have been `False`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the comparison of blocks after sorting by `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting is not correctly retrieving the `mgr_locs` attribute from the blocks. This results in incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly. We should convert `mgr_locs` to a list before sorting to ensure proper comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
