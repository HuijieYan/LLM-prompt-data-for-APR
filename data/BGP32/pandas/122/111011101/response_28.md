### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class because the comparison logic for the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is incorrect. The function is trying to compare blocks between two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality. However, the comparison logic is flawed because it does not consider the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The function sorts the blocks based on a canonical representation combining the block type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure a consistent order for comparison. This sorting is done to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly. 

The bug arises when comparing the blocks, as the implemented comparison logic does not handle the case where the order of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be different due to sorting. As a result, the function wrongly returns `True` when `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may have the same blocks but in a different order.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should take into account the sorting that occurs before comparison. To ensure that the comparison accounts for the sorted blocks, we need to compare the blocks directly after sorting them based on the canonical representation. This will ensure that blocks are matched correctly even if their order within the `BlockManager` is different.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks within different `BlockManager` instances, considering the sorting order based on the canonical representation. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
