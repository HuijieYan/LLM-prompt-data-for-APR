### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks. The bug is likely occurring due to the sorting of blocks inside the function. The sorting process uses a `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs` values. 

However, in the failing test case provided, the `canonicalize` function is not handling the situation where the blocks have different data types in the DataFrame columns. This leads to incorrect sorting and subsequent comparison issues when comparing the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the order of the blocks in the DataFrame columns. This can help distinguish blocks even if they have different data types. By including the column order information in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that blocks are correctly sorted for comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs and order within DataFrame columns
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name, 
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            list(block.mgr_locs.get_indexer())
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we included the order of blocks within DataFrame columns in the `canonicalize` function by adding `list(block.mgr_locs.get_indexer())`. This modification ensures that blocks are correctly sorted for comparison, considering both data types and column orders.
