### Bug Explanation
The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The bug arises because the function fails to compare the block data correctly. It tries to sort the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`, but it mishandles the tuple representation of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function causing the bug.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function where the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is wrongly used. This leads to incorrect sorting of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to extract the actual `mgr_locs` values from the blocks and sort the tuples correctly for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version should address the sorting issue related to `mgr_locs` and allow the function to correctly compare `BlockManager` instances.
