### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) for equality. The function compares the axes of the two DataFrames and then proceeds to compare the blocks within the DataFrames. The issue stems from the comparison of the blocks.

The buggy part uses a sorting mechanism to ensure a consistent block order for comparison purposes. However, the `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple for sorting, is not taking into account the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` components of the block. This results in incorrect sorting of blocks and subsequently incorrect comparison of blocks.

The sorted blocks need to be compared for equality using the `equals` function, which is the correct approach. However, the sorting mechanism needs to be fixed to ensure a proper comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function must correctly account for the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` components of the block. By including these components in the tuple used for sorting, the blocks will be sorted properly before comparison, ensuring that the blocks are compared correctly for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include `dtype.name`, `mgr_locs`, and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the blocks will be sorted correctly before comparison. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
