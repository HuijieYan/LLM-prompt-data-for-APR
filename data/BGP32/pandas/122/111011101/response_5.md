### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function checks if the axes are the same, consolidates both instances, compares the number of blocks, then sorts and compares each block. 

Based on the failing test case provided, the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is incorrect. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, the comparison leads to `True`, which causes the test to fail.

#### Observations:
1. The axes of the two `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other` are correctly being retrieved.
2. The number of blocks in `self` and `other` are being compared accurately.
3. The process of canonicalizing the blocks involves sorting them by type name and manager locations.

Now, let's identify the potential issue in the code and devise a strategy to fix it.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue likely lies in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. It seems that the block comparison logic within the function might be incorrect, leading to the misinterpretation of DataFrame equality.

To fix this bug, the comparison mechanism within the `equals` function should be revised to accurately evaluate the equality of blocks. We need to focus on the actual content of the blocks while sorting and comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version includes changes to the sorting and comparison process within the `equals` function. By sorting the blocks based on their string representation and manager locations, the function now ensures a more accurate comparison between the `BlockManager` instances.
