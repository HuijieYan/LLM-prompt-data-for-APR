### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue arises because the comparison depends on the block order in the `blocks` attribute, and the blocks are sorted differently for `self` and `other`, leading to a false equality check even when the two instances should not be equal.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting key function `canonicalize` does not handle the sorting criteria properly, resulting in the wrong order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly sorting the `blocks` attribute based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks, the sorting order does not guarantee correct comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the sorting criterion in the `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to ensure consistent and accurate sorting of the blocks. The sorting logic needs to be modified to correctly compare blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the sorting key function `canonicalize` to consider the correct attributes for the block sorting, the comparison between `BlockManager` instances will now be accurate, resolving the bug.
