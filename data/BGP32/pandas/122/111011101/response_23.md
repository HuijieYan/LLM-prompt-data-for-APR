### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class from `pandas`. The purpose of this method is to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block content.

The bug arises from how the method is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. It sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function before comparing them. The bug occurs due to a mismatch in the sorting criteria, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done correctly based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. We need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the `dtype.name` and the string representation of `mgr_locs` to enable accurate block ordering for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize_block` function to include both the type name and the string representation of `mgr_locs`, we ensure that blocks are correctly ordered before comparison. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the `equals` method to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances.
