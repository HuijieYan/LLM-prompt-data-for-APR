### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs because the implementation is comparing the blocks without considering the specific contents within each block, leading to incorrect results.
3. The error message shows that the comparison of the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The issue lies in the comparison logic within the for loop that compares each block of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
5. The comparison should be based on the actual data within the blocks rather than just their type and locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the data within each block while maintaining the comparison logic for axes.
2. We should update the `canonicalize` function to consider block values in addition to their type and locations.
3. Update the comparison logic within the function to correctly compare the data in each block.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order considering block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare the blocks based on their actual contents in addition to their type and locations, resolving the bug.
