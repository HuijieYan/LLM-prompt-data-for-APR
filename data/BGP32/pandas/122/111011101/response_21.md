### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals()` aims to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The bug arises due to the comparison logic within the function. 

1. The function extracts `self_axes` and `other_axes` to compare the axes of both `BlockManager` instances. If the axes have different lengths, the function directly returns `False`.

2. The bug occurs during the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function tries to sort the blocks using a custom `canonicalize()` function, which generates a tuple based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. However, the `canonicalize()` function uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is incorrect and leads to the failure in comparing blocks.

3. Ultimately, the incorrect tuple generation causes the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals()` function, the `canonicalize()` function must be updated to correctly generate the tuple for sorting the blocks. The `as_array.tolist()` method call should be replaced with a suitable method that extracts the necessary information for block comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on the dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        locs = block.mgr_locs.indexer
        return (block.dtype.name, locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize()` function generates tuples based on the necessary attributes for sorting the blocks correctly.
