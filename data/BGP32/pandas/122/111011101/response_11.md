### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. In the provided buggy implementation, there is an issue with the way blocks are sorted for comparison. The sorting logic lacks consideration for potential inconsistency in block orders due to the data types.

The function attempts to perform a comparison between blocks in a sorted manner based on the data type name and the locations of the blocks within the block manager. However, the inconsistency in block order due to unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical blocks, can lead to incorrect sorting. This results in incorrect block-wise comparison and ultimately leads to a failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism for blocks before comparing them. One way to address this issue is to ensure that the sorting mechanism considers the data type, but also incorporates a more robust way to uniquely identify and sort blocks across different `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block IDs to ensure consistent comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return id(block)

    # Sort blocks by block IDs to ensure consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their unique IDs for consistency in comparison. This approach avoids the issue of unconsolidated block order affecting the equality check between two `BlockManager` objects.
