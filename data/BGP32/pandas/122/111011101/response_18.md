### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves. However, the bug is caused by the incorrect ordering of the blocks during the comparison, leading to the comparison failing even when the actual block values are the same.

The core issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, it treats `mgr_locs` as a list, while it should be a slice object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute, which is a slice, rather than a list. By properly converting the slice object to a list of values for comparison, the sorting can be done correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.start, block.mgr_locs.stop, block.mgr_locs.step)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to extract the start, stop, and step values from the `mgr_locs` slice object, the blocks will be correctly ordered for comparison, fixing the bug.
