### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class where it is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks within the two instances. The function checks if the number of blocks in the two instances is equal and then attempts to sort and compare the blocks. However, there are inconsistencies in the sorting logic due to the way blocks are compared and ordered. 

The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, resulting in `assert True is False`, which suggests that the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are incorrectly found to be equal when they are not.

The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that generates a tuple to sort the blocks based on data type name and `mgr_locs`. The current comparison based on `mgr_locs` is causing the bug, as it may not yield the correct order of blocks for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting and comparison logic in the `equals` method is correct based on the blocks' data type and content. Specifically, the comparison based on the `mgr_locs` attribute may not be suitable for determining block equality.

One way to improve the comparison is to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual block data instead of `mgr_locs`. This change would ensure that the comparison is based on the data contained in the blocks rather than their references or locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if the blocks are equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their data type names only and then directly comparing the blocks in the loop, we can ensure a correct comparison. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
