### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function where it compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue arises when the function tries to canonicalize the blocks for comparison by using a sorting mechanism based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. The bug is related to sorting blocks based on the `mgr_locs` attribute, which is a `BlockPlacement` object. The sorting operation throws an error due to comparing `BlockPlacement` instances directly in the canonicalize function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the comparison of `BlockPlacement` instances. One way to achieve this is by converting the `mgr_locs` attribute into a comparable format before sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), block.mgr_locs.start, block.mgr_locs.stop, block.mgr_locs.step)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting the `mgr_locs` attribute into a comparable format within the `canonicalize` function, the blocks can be sorted correctly based on dtype name and mgr_locs values. This updated logic ensures the `equals` function operates as expected, resolving the bug.
