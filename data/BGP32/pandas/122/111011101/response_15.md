### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a comparison mismatch between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is done on sorted blocks based on type and location within the managers. The bug causes the assertion to fail because the block types are not matching and are sorted differently in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the same criteria before comparing them. One approach to resolve this issue is to sort the blocks based on block type and then on their location within the managers before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on block type and then on their location within the managers, ensuring consistent ordering for comparison. Now, the function should produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
