### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to an incorrect comparison logic between the blocks in `self` and `other`. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks and then checking if each pair of blocks are equal. However, the error stems from not correctly canonicalizing the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function is used to generate a tuple that represents each block, but it fails to create a valid representation, leading to incorrect block ordering and subsequent erroneous comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent and unique tuple for each block. One way to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block data itself for comparison. This modification will ensure that not only the type name but also the actual data content is considered during block comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block data and type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By including `block.values` in the tuple representation within the `canonicalize` function, we enhance the uniqueness of blocks' comparison, which should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
