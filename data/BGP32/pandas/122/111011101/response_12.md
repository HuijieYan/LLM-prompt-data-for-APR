### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing the blocks inside the `self` and `other` BlockManagers for equality. The bug causes the comparison to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

The bug is caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple combining the dtype name and the `mgr_locs`. The problem arises because the `mgr_locs` attribute is not valid to directly convert to a list, as it is of type `BlockPlacement`. This results in the incorrect comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the `BlockPlacement` object correctly. We can convert it to a list before generating the tuple for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `mgr_locs` attribute is properly converted to a list before generating the tuple for comparison, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
