### Bug Explanation
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating the objects, and finally comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
- In the failing test case, the two `BlockManager` objects have the same axes but different blocks.
- The bug arises from the comparison of blocks where it sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations within the manager. This leads to the incorrect comparison of blocks and causes the function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
1. Ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual data within the blocks, not just their data type and locations.
2. Implement a comparison of blocks that checks for equality based on their content, not just their metadata.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on the actual data within the blocks
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the blocks directly based on their content, the corrected function will now accurately check for equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
