### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly.

1. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not equal. If they are not equal, it should return `False`, indicating that the `BlockManager` instances are not equal.
2. Then it checks if all the values in `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal by iterating through them. If any pair of axes is not equal, it should return `False`.
3. Next, it consolidates the internal structures of both instances using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. This step is important to compare the blocks properly.
4. After consolidation, it compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, the function should return `False`.
5. Finally, it iterates through the blocks in both instances, sorts them based on a canonical criteria (data type name and manager locations), and compares each pair of blocks. If any pair is not equal, it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to be happening in the block comparison logic. We need to ensure that the comparison is done correctly for all blocks in the `BlockManager` instances. One possible fix could be to refactor the block comparison logic by examining the `equals` method for the `Block` objects within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we ensure that the blocks are properly compared by using the `equals` method for each pair of blocks and sorting them based on a canonical criteria. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
