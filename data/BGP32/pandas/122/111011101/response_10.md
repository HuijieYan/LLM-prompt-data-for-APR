### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks within each `BlockManager` object.

1. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
2. It then checks if the axes are equal by iterating through them with `all` and the `equals` method. If any axis is not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects in place.
4. It compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager` object. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
5. The bug seems to be in the block comparison part. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function. The canonicalization function converts each block to a tuple consisting of the block's `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`. It then sorts the blocks based on this tuple and compares them to check for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
1. Ensure that the comparison between the blocks is conducted correctly by accounting for the structure of the blocks and their contents.
2. Verify that the sorting and comparison of blocks are accurate and consider any potential discrepancies in the sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_key(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `sort_key` function to handle the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes properly, the corrected version ensures a consistent ordering for block comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function function correctly.
