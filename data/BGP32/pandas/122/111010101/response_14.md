### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in pandas. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks if the axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves are equal between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Potential error locations

1. The comparison of the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.

### Cause of the bug

The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False, leading to an AssertionError in the test case. This suggests that the comparison of the `BlockManager` instances is not working correctly. The issue might lie in how the axes are compared or how the blocks are sorted and compared.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly. We should verify that the axes are equal in length and content between the two `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, we should ensure that the blocks are properly sorted and compared based on their dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method first ensures that the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal in length and content. It then consolidates both instances in place before comparing the number of blocks. Lastly, it properly sorts and compares the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations to determine equality.
