### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks the equality of their axes, consolidates the instances in place, compares the number of blocks, and then compares the blocks themselves by sorting and iterating over them.
   
2. The error message indicates that the comparison of two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` fails due to the unexpected return of `True` instead of `False` when using the `equals` method.

3. The bug likely stems from how the `equals` method compares the blocks in the `BlockManager`. The bug may arise from how the blocks are sorted and compared, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are correctly sorted and then compared for equality.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Deep comparison of blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By explicitly iterating over the sorted blocks and comparing them one by one, this corrected version ensures that the comparison is done correctly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the equality comparison of `BlockManager` instances works correctly.
