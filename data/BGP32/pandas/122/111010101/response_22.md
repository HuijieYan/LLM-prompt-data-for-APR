### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` for two dataframes that are not equal.
3. The buggy function first compares the lengths of the axes, then checks if all axes are equal, consolidates the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances, sorts the blocks, and finally compares each block for equality.
4. The bug might be related to how blocks are compared for equality or how they are sorted.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared for equality based on their dtype and mgr_locs, and that the sorting does not introduce any discrepancies in the comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to compare blocks for equality
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block in sorted order for equality
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes a separate `blocks_equal` function to compare individual blocks for equality. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function now correctly extracts the mgr_locs as a slice to ensure correct sorting. This should address the bug and ensure the function correctly determines the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
