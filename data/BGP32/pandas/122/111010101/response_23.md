### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating in-place, and comparing the block contents in a canonicalized order.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing for two DataFrames that have different values.
3. The `equals` function iterates over blocks within each `BlockManager` instance and checks for equality. The bug likely arises from comparing the wrong blocks or improper ordering during the canonicalization step.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and in the same order. It's important to handle various block types and the order in which they are stored within the `BlockManager`.
5. The bug can be fixed by identifying and sorting blocks correctly before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared during the `equals` method call, addressing the bug that caused the comparison failure.
