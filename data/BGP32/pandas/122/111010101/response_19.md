### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, if their blocks are equal, and if the block order is the same.
2. The error message suggests that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two unequal DataFrames.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be in the comparison logic where the check for block equality is incorrect.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of comparing blocks using a consistent and reliable method. Now, the function should return the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` instances as expected.
