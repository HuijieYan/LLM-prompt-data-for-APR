### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class when comparing two instances. The bug is likely causing the function to return `True` incorrectly, leading to the failing test result.

1. The buggy function first checks if the lengths of the `self.axes` and `other.axes` lists are equal. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.

2. Then, it compares each element in `self.axes` with the corresponding element in `other.axes` using the `equals` method. If any pair of elements is not equal, the function returns `False`.

3. Next, the function calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both `self` and `other` instances.

4. The function then compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.

5. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` instances based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, then compares each block pair using the `equals` method. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`.

Potential Issues:
- The bug might be in the way the blocks are sorted and compared. There may be a discrepancy in the sorting order or the way blocks are compared for equality.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the sorting and comparison logic for blocks to ensure correct ordering and equality comparison.
2. Verify that the `equals` method for blocks is correctly implemented to compare block contents.
3. Ensure that the function handles all edge cases and unexpected input scenarios.
4. Validate that the `_consolidate_inplace` method is correctly consolidating the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x).__name__, x.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x).__name__, x.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently and compared correctly for equality, addressing the potential issue in the buggy code.
