### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should not.
   
2. The potential error locations are:
   - The comparison of axes might not be working correctly.
   - The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function might be causing unexpected behavior.

3. The bug occurs because the comparison of axes and sorting of blocks is not functioning as expected, leading to the incorrect `True` result instead of `False`. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` when the two instances are not equal.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Correctly compare the axes of both `self` and `other` objects.
   - Ensure that the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function is accurate and results in a valid comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if number of blocks are equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__hash__(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the comparison of axes and the sorting of blocks, the function should now return the correct result based on the equality of the `BlockManager` instances. This should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
