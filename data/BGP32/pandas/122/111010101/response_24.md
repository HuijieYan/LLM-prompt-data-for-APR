### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality. It compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks, and then compares each block in order.
2. The test case is asserting that two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are not equal using the `equals()` function. However, the test is failing with the error message indicating that the assertion `True is False` failed.
3. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the input DataFrames in the `equals()` function. The comparison logic of the function is not correctly handling the comparison of the DataFrames.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances is done correctly by considering all attributes that determine the equality.
5. We need to correct the logic in the `equals()` function to accurately compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected equals() function in the BlockManager class

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)  # Changed to capture block type and locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to also consider the type of block along with the locations, we ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function are done correctly. This correction should now pass the failing test case.
