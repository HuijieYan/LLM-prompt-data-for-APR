### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. It checks if the axes and blocks of the two instances are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects fails, leading to an `AssertionError`.
3. The buggy function does not handle the case where the block order in the two `BlockManager` instances might be different, causing the comparison to fail unexpectedly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them. This will ensure that we are comparing the equivalent blocks in the same order.
5. We will modify the buggy function to sort the blocks in both instances based on a canonical order before comparing them.

### Correction:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Canonicalize block order based on dtype.name and block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the function sorts the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them, thereby ensuring a consistent comparison order. This should resolve the `AssertionError` observed in the failing test.
