### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by iteratively checking the equality of each block within them.
2. The failing test is asserting that two dataframes are not equal, but the comparison inside the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug is likely happening in the comparison loop where blocks are being compared. The order of columns in the blocks might be causing the issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a consistent manner before comparing them, so that the order of the blocks does not affect the result.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before comparing the blocks to ensure a consistent ordering for comparison.
2. A stable sorting mechanism based on the block's data type and locations can be used to ensure the ordering is deterministic and consistent.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on data type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists based on a consistent criterion before comparison, the function should now correctly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.
