### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. It then sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize()` and compares each pair of blocks for equality.

2. The error message indicates that the test failed when comparing two `DataFrame` instances where the values of columns 'a' and 'b' are swapped.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not consider the content of the blocks when comparing equality. It only checks the order of the blocks and their types, leading to a false positive when the content is different but the blocks are ordered similarly.

4. To fix the bug, we should implement a more detailed comparison of the block content. One approach is to check the values within each block for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks content
    equal_blocks = all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

    return equal_blocks
``` 

This corrected version compares the values within each block for equality using the `all()` and `all()` methods to check if all elements are equal within each block. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
