### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class checks the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` for two unequal DataFrames.
2. The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` due to the order of blocks, which leads to the unexpected result.
3. The cause of the bug is likely that the blocks are not being sorted properly before comparison, resulting in an incorrect equality check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` before comparing them to ensure a consistent order.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks before comparison based on the defined `canonicalize` function, the corrected version guarantees a consistent comparison order. This should resolve the bug and lead to the correct equality check for `BlockManager` instances.
