### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function 'equals' is defined within the 'BlockManager' class.
2. The function compares two instances of 'BlockManager' objects to check if they are equal.
3. The function first checks if the number of axes of the two 'BlockManager' objects is equal.
4. Then, it compares each axis of the two objects.
5. After that, it consolidates the blocks of both objects in place.
6. Finally, it checks if the number of blocks in each 'BlockManager' object is equal and compares each block.

### Identification of potential error locations
1. The error message points to the assertion failure when trying to assert that `df1.equals(df2) is False`.
2. The error message mentions that `assert True is False`, indicating that the buggy function is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. The function compares individual blocks in a sorted manner, which might not be correct based on the input data.

### Cause of the bug
1. The bug seems to be occurring during the comparison of blocks within the 'equals' function.
2. The 'canonicalize' function used to sort blocks might not be handling the block comparison correctly.
3. The function is incorrectly returning 'True' even when the two 'BlockManager' objects are not equal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. We need to ensure that the blocks are actually equal before returning 'True'.
2. It's necessary to handle the sorting and comparison of blocks in a way that ensures accurate equality checking.
3. The 'canonicalize' function may need adjustments to cater to different block types and values accurately.

### Corrected version of the 'equals' function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, combining type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.row_indexer().tolist(), block.mgr_locs.col_indexer().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
1. The 'canonicalize' function now includes the type name and locations of the block.
2. The sorting mechanism now considers both type name and locations for accurate comparison.
3. The comparison loop now verifies the equality of each block pair before returning the final result.
