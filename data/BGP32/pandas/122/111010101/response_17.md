### Bug Identification:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` data types between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes. However, the `dtype.name` comparison between an IntBlock and ObjectBlock would lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparisons between the blocks consider both the data type and the block type. We can achieve this by adding checks to compare the types of blocks and only proceed with the comparison if the types match.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now includes the type of the block in the tuple used for sorting. This ensures that blocks of different datatypes are not incorrectly considered equal.
