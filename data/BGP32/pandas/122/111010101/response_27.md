### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
3. The expected input values for the buggy function include two `BlockManager` instances containing blocks of different types (int64 and object).
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
5. The `block.equals` comparison may not be handling blocks of different types correctly, leading to the failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks with different data types (int64 and object) without proper handling in the `equals` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method to consider the block's data type along with its location.
2. Update the comparison logic to handle blocks with different data types appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with this fix, the comparison within the `equals` function should handle blocks of different types in `BlockManager` instances correctly.
