### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in each instance, and then compares the individual blocks for equality based on their type and location.
3. The failing test case shows that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances fails, indicating a bug in the block equality comparison logic within the `equals` function.
4. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks based on their type and location, as the test case fails to correctly compare the two `DataFrame` instances.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to modify how the blocks are sorted and compared in the function to ensure correct equality checks.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to `block_key` and sorting the blocks based on the type name and the binary representation of `mgr_locs`, we ensure a consistent and correct order of blocks for comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case for comparing two `DataFrame` instances for equality.
