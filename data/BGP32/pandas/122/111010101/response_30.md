### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error message suggests that the comparison is not returning the expected result.

#### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the function may be faulty.
2. The sorting of blocks may not be done correctly.

#### Cause of the bug:
The comparison is failing because the order of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects is not matching. The function sorts the blocks in each `BlockManager` object based on the block's type and location, to then compare corresponding blocks between the two objects. If the order of blocks is different in the two objects, the comparison will fail even if the content of the blocks is the same.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects in the same way before comparing them. By ensuring that the block order is consistent, the comparison will return the expected result.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue with the block ordering mismatch should be resolved, and the comparison between two `BlockManager` objects should now return the expected result.
