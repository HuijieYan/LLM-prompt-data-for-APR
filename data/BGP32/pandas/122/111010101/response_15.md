### Analysis:
1. The buggy function "equals" compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. It first checks if the axes are the same, then consolidates the blocks of both objects before comparing each block for equality by sorting them based on a canonicalization function that combines dtype name and mgr_locs.
   
2. The failing test shows that the comparison fails even when the two DataFrames have different values. This could be due to incorrect handling of blocks in the comparison process.

### Bug:
The bug in the buggy function "equals" occurs in the block canonicalization process. The canonicalize function does not correctly process the mgr_locs attribute of a block, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks. This bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to the failing test.

### Fix:
1. We need to update the canonicalize function to properly handle the mgr_locs attribute of blocks when sorting them.
2. Ensure that the mgr_locs attribute is correctly extracted as a list for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain the same as provided in the starter code

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Upadted canonicalize function to handle block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice(), block.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version properly handles the mgr_locs attribute by converting it to a list in the canonicalize function to ensure that the block comparison mechanisms sort and compare the blocks correctly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function produces the correct results for the failing test case.
