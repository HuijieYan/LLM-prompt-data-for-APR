### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, which is not correctly handling the comparison of axes and blocks.
4. The `canonicalize` function is intended to standardize the blocks for comparison, but the sorting and comparison logic after that might be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that both instances have the same number of axes and that each axis is equal.
2. Consolidate the blocks in both instances for a fair comparison.
3. Sort the blocks based on a standardized key to compare them correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By following this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two instances of `BlockManager` and return the expected result for the failing test.
