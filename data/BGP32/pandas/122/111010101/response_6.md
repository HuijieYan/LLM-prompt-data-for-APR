### Bug analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class for equality. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

The error message indicates that the comparison is not working as expected for the provided test case. The test case involves creating two `DataFrame` objects with different data content and then comparing them using the `equals()` method, which internally calls the buggy `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class.

The buggy function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, leading to an incorrect `True` return in cases when it should be `False`.

### Bug location
The bug is likely in the block comparison part of the `equals()` function where it sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function and then compares them one by one. It seems like the `canonicalize` function might not be extracting the necessary information for proper block comparison.

### Bug cause
The bug arises from how the `canonicalize` function handles the `block` objects. It generates a tuple consisting of the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The bug might be in how `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is handled or the information extracted from it might not be suitable for proper block comparison.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `canonicalize` function generates a suitable representation of the blocks for comparison. We should ensure that the extracted information from `block` is meaningful and can accurately represent the content of the block.

### Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.blocks[0].values, block.blocks[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function should now accurately compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result based on their equality.
