### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks attributes. It then sorts and compares the blocks within each object.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, where `df1` and `df2` are instances of `DataFrame`. This failure is likely due to an issue in the comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The function compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly without considering the order of the blocks. It sorts the blocks based on the block type and their position, but it fails to handle the case where the dtype names might differ within the blocks.
4. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype name of the blocks while sorting them.
5. We also need to update the `equals` function to use the updated `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including dtype names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the blocks will be sorted based on the dtype names along with the block type and position, ensuring a correct comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects.
