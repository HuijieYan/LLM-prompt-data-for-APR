### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects along with their attributes such as axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` DataFrames using the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of block contents within the `equals` function, leading to an incorrect result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison logic is correctly implemented in the `equals` function.
5. The corrected version of the function should ensure that the block contents are correctly compared.

### Proposed Fix:
I will update the logic in the `equals` function to correctly compare the block contents by sorting them based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # existing code omitted for clarity

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, I've modified the `canonicalize` function to convert the block's dtype to a string for sorting. I've also called `.as_array()` to convert the `mgr_locs` to a list before sorting. These changes should address the bug and ensure the correct comparison of block contents in the `equals` function.
