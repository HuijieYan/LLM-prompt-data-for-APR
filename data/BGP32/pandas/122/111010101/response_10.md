### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic contains a bug.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. The function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` attribute, leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the `mgr_locs` attribute properly in the comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` while sorting the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block.
2. Ensure that the sorting order of the blocks considers both the dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
3. Once the sorting is correct, the comparison logic between the blocks should work as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With the updated `canonicalize` function that includes `mgr_locs` and correct sorting, the `equals` function should now compare `BlockManager` objects correctly and pass the failing test case.
