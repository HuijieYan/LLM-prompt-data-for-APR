### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` was incorrect, leading to the assertion failure.
- The expected input values include `axes`, `blocks`, and specific properties of the `BlockManager` instances.
- The bug seems to be related to how the comparison of blocks is performed in the buggy function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to a incorrect comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a combination of dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect comparison results when blocks are not consolidated.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure that both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances are consolidated in place before comparing blocks.
2. Ensure that blocks are compared accurately by checking the equality of dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case.
