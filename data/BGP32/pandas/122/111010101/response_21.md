### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking if the axes and blocks are equal.
2. The error is in the comparison logic where `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function which uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `Block`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is an instance of `BlockPlacement` and needs to be converted to a list before comparison.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing and returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing.
2. Update the comparison logic to handle the list of `mgr_locs` correctly.
3. Ensure all types and values are consistent in the comparison process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected version includes converting `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing in the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that the comparison is done correctly based on the actual data structure of the blocks.
