### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The error message indicates that the method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which implies that the two `BlockManager` instances are considered equal when they should not be.
4. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances and returns `False` if they are not equal. It first compares the length of axes, then the equality of individual axes, consolidates the blocks in both instances, sorts the blocks, and finally compares each block's equality.
5. The issue seems to be with the comparison of the blocks. The function mistakenly considers two `BlockManager` instances with different block orderings as equal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly without being affected by their order.
2. One approach could be to sort the blocks based on some canonical key before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Compare the axes of both BlockManagers
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks in both instances
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a function to generate a canonical key for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort blocks based on the canonical key
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block for equality
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By using the `canonicalize` function to generate consistent keys for each block, the corrected function ensures that block comparison is not affected by their order. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method work correctly for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
