### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and block values.
2. The error message suggests that the comparison of two `DataFrame` instances fails with a `True` assertion error.
3. The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the `equals` function where the order of blocks is not correctly handled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on a canonical representation before comparing them.
5. The correction involves sorting the blocks before comparing them in the `equals` function.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them in the `equals` function, the bug causing the failing test should be fixed.
