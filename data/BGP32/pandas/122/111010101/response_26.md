### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not handle cases where the axes are not exactly the same.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be consistent.
3. The comparison between `block` and `oblock` inside the `all()` function may not handle all cases properly.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect behavior of comparing DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The comparison is currently based on ordering and may not handle cases where the contents of the DataFrames are the same but the column order is different. This results in the assertion error seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to properly compare DataFrames based on their content rather than their structure/ordering. One way to do this is by comparing the values directly after sorting them.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Direct comparison of axes
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on the values
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version directly compares the values of the blocks after sorting, ensuring that the comparison is done based on the content of the DataFrames rather than their internal structure.
