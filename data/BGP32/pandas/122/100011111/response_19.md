### Bug Analysis:
1. **Error Message**: The test is failing with `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
2. **Runtime Values (Case 1)**:
   - The buggy function compares two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, with mismatched values in columns.
   - The function checks axes equality first, then blocks' lengths, and finally compares individual blocks.
   - In this case, identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as equal.
3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The bug originates from incorrect block canonicalization, leading to identical blocks with different positions being deemed equal.
   - The `canonicalize` function should differentiate blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Improve the `canonicalize` block comparison function to consider both type and `mgr_locs`.
   - Ensure that blocks with identical values but different `mgr_locs` are not erroneously treated as equal.
5. **Corrected Function**:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.storage.dtype.name, hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the block canonicalization to include hash value of block values, the function should now differentiate between blocks with identical content but different locations, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
