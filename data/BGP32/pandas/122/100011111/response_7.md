### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two BlockManagers for equality. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, implying that the function incorrectly returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
2. The comparison in the function involves checking axes, consolidating the BlockManagers, and then comparing blocks within the BlockManagers using the `equals` method of each block.
3. In the failing test, the comparison fails due to the order of blocks being different in `self` and `other`, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
4. To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the order of blocks in `self` and `other` does not affect the equality check in the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the order of blocks does not affect the equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before comparing the blocks, the corrected function ensures that the equality check is consistent regardless of the block ordering.
