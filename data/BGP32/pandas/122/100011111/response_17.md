### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` to fail. The function is wrongly returning `True` instead of `False` when checking if two DataFrames are equal. The issue is related to identical blocks with different locations being wrongly compared as equal.

### Correction Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of comparing blocks with different locations. One potential strategy is to modify the comparison logic to appropriately handle blocks with different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include more information to distinguish blocks, such as their positions within the DataFrame.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the locations and values of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
