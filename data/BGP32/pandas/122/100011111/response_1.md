### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, resulting in `assert True is False`.
3. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates them, sorts the blocks based on types and locations, and finally compares the blocks for equality.
4. The bug likely arises from the sorting mechanism used for the blocks which does not consider the order of the blocks within the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the DataFrames are ordered correctly and consider both their type and location for comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function ensures proper sorting of blocks considering both the block type and the location within the DataFrame, enabling correct comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
