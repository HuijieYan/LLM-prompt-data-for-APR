### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two BlockManagers for equality.
- The error message indicates that the function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered unequal.
- The input parameters `self` and `other` represent two BlockManagers with their corresponding axes and blocks.
- The function first checks the lengths of the axes of both BlockManagers, which seems to be correct.
- Then, it iterates over the axes to compare them. If they are not equal, it correctly returns `False`.
- The bug likely occurs when checking the equality of the blocks within the BlockManagers.
- The bug might be due to the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparing them, potentially causing unexpected results.
- The incorrect comparison leads to the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure a consistent and accurate comparison of blocks.
- Check the comparison logic inside the loop iterating over the sorted blocks.
- Ensure that for any discrepancies in the blocks, the function correctly returns `False`.
- Verify that both BlockManagers are compared accurately and consistently to reflect their true equality.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.items.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.items.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the modifications proposed above, the function should compare two BlockManagers correctly and return the expected results, fixing the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
