### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, suggesting that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, the function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and then sorts and compares the blocks based on their types and locations.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the data types are mismatched between the blocks, resulting in the incorrect comparison and return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals()` function. Specifically, we need to only consider the blocks equal if their data types match. If the data types are different, we can directly return `False`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ) if all(block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)) else False
```

By adding the condition `if all(block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)) else False` before the final comparison, we ensure that the blocks are only deemed equal if their data types match. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
