### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `equals`, is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`, are equals. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, suggesting that the function is not returning the expected result.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` object. It then applies sorting to blocks based on a canonicalization function before comparing each block for equality.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is failing even though the dataframes differ in values, leading to the wrong assertion result.
4. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the values in the blocks when sorting, not just the dtype and mgr_locs.

### Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include the block data values in the sorting criteria
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function for sorting, the function will now properly check for equality based on both the data type, location, and actual data within the blocks. This should fix the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected.
