### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two BlockManager objects.
- The error message shows that the comparison returns `True` incorrectly when it is expected to be `False`.
- The issue on GitHub describes the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method.
- The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations.
- The bug might be related to how the function canonicalizes the blocks for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
- In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations for comparison.
- A block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` are combined into a tuple to determine the order.
- However, the bug might arise from blocks with the same data type and location but different data values, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalization function to consider the block's data values for sorting.
- The comparison should prioritize data values over data types and locations to ensure accurate equality checks.
- This can be achieved by considering the block's data content in addition to its type name and location during sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, location, and data values
    def canonicalize(block):
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
        return key

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version adjusts the `canonicalize` function to include the block values in the sorting order, ensuring that blocks with the same data type and location but different data values are correctly compared.
