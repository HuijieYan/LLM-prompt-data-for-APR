### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, including their axes and blocks. The issue is arising when checking the equality of blocks within the `canonicalize` function. The function `canonicalize` generates tuples based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect comparisons.

The failing test case involves two DataFrames with identical blocks but with swapped locations, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`. However, the function mistakenly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use block data itself for comparison instead of relying on `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the equality check is based on the actual block contents rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_list()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to return `block.to_list()`, the corrected version ensures that the content of blocks is compared instead of their locations. This will address the issue and make the `equals` function perform the expected equality check.
