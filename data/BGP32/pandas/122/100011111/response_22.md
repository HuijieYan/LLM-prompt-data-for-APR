### Bug Analysis:
The `equals()` function is comparing two DataFrames by their axes and blocks. In the failing test case, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are passed in, and the assertion fails because the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. This indicates a bug in the comparison logic within the function.

The error message states that `assert True is False`, showing that the function mistakenly returns `True` when it should be `False`. The function compares axes, consolidates the blocks, and sorts blocks based on their dtype and locations. However, there is a logical flaw in the block comparison process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly compares all blocks within the DataFrames. The issue seems to stem from sorting the blocks based on dtype and locations without adequately comparing the block contents.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function removes the sorting of blocks and directly compares each block within the DataFrames. This should address the issue of incorrect comparison results and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
