### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects containing axes and blocks.
- The comparison logic involves checking the length of axes, their equality, consolidating the blocks, and comparing the blocks.
- The error message indicates that the comparison fails when comparing two DataFrames, resulting in an incorrect assertion.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the function `equals` does not handle the scenario where the columns are of different types in the DataFrames being compared.
- The comparison logic does not consider the data type of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the block when sorting the blocks for comparison.
- Update the comparison logic to consider both the data type and block content for equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the data type of the blocks during comparison, the corrected function should now properly handle the equality comparison, passing the failing test and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
