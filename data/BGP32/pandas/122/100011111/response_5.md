### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` list and the `other.blocks` list. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on their data type and locations to perform the comparison. However, the bug causes it to return `True` incorrectly when the two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug can be identified as the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by their data type and locations. When performing the comparison in the buggy function, the sorting based on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` results in incorrect ordering, ultimately leading to the function returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism based on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be revised. Instead of relying on the locations, it would be more appropriate to focus solely on the data type for equality comparison. By removing the dependence on locations for this comparison, the function can correctly determine that the DataFrames are not equal in cases where blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def dtype_sort(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=dtype_sort)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=dtype_sort)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the reliance on block locations during sorting and focuses only on the data type. Now the function properly compares the two BlockManager objects based on their data type ordering, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
