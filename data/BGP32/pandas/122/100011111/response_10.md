### Analysis:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even if the `BlockManager` objects have different block locations but same data. The issue arises from the comparison logic that doesn't consider the block location.

### Bug:
The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function that creates tuples based only on the block's data type and not its location. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the block's locations when creating the tuples for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to consider block dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and block location, we ensure that blocks with the same data but different positions are treated as unequal, resolving the bug.
