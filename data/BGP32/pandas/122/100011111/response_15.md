### Analysis:
1. The buggy function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and then compares their blocks. If the length of the axes or the blocks is different, it returns False.
2. The issue stems from the comparison of the blocks, where the function sorts the blocks based on their type name and location.
3. In Case 1, the expected input/output values show that the `self` and `other` objects have different block orders. The function compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the `self` and `other` objects have blocks with the same `dtype.name` values, leading to a false comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers not only the `dtype.name` but also the values within the blocks.
5. I will correct the function and consider the values within the blocks for proper comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values().tolist())  # Include block values for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the comparison within the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the function can properly distinguish between blocks even if they have the same `dtype.name`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test successfully.
