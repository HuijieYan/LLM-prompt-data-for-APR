### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to test failures.
3. The function iterates over blocks in both `self` and `other` objects. It then sorts and compares these blocks.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function compares blocks based on both data type (`block.dtype.name`) and memory location (`block.mgr_locs`) but fails to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data type for comparison, ignoring the memory location.
6. The corrected function should return `False` when comparing the provided test DataFrames since they contain identical blocks with different locations.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data type name for comparison, the corrected function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks with different memory locations exist, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
