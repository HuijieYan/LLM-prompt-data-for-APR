### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is expected to compare two `BlockManager` instances including their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.
3. The function fails to compare the blocks correctly due to incorrect sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
4. The issue on GitHub mentions this exact problem where the function returns `True` incorrectly in such cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks due to the wrong order resulting from sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Strategy to Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the sorting mechanism for the blocks before comparing them. We should consider both the dtype and location of the blocks to ensure a proper comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to sort blocks based on dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both the dtype and location (`mgr_locs`), the corrected function should now properly compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case.
