### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first compares the axes of the objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks within the objects. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks.

#### Error:
The error message states: `assert True is False`. It indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` for the equality check of `df1` and `df2`.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the block comparison part of the function, where it sorts and compares the individual blocks.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. In the provided test case, the data types of the blocks are different, which should result in them being treated as unequal. However, due to the sorting mechanism, the function incorrectly considers them equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison criteria need to be adjusted to consider not only the data type and locations but also the actual content of the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the contents of the blocks directly without sorting based on data type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing each block without sorting based on data type and locations, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the comparison of `BlockManager` objects for equality. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function return the expected result for the failing test case.
