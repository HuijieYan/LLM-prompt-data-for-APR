### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are equal.
2. The failing test is asserting that two DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function erroneously returns `True`.
3. During the execution, the function correctly compares axes, then incorrectly sorts blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. This sorting operation causes the function to return `True` for DataFrames with same blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, avoid sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, as they might be identical even if in different locations. Just compare the blocks directly for equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. This sorting operation causes DataFrames with identical block content but in different locations to be considered equal erroneously.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on content only, not on dtype and mgr_locs. Then compare the blocks directly for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the blocks directly, the corrected function will properly determine the equality of DataFrames and address the bug reported in GitHub.
