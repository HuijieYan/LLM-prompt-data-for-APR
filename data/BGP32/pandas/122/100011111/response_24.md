### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManagers by checking the equality of their axes, block lengths, and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` should return `False`, but it incorrectly returns `True`.
- The issue is reported on GitHub with the expected behavior of returning `False` for such cases.

### Bugs:
1. The comparison logic in the buggy function does not handle cases where the data type of columns does not match.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function could lead to incorrect comparisons due to different orders.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add a check to compare the data types of columns between `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
2. Refactor the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and block location to ensure consistent comparisons.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Consider dtype as string

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the data type as a string in `canonicalize` and adding a check for the lengths of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the corrected function addresses the bugs and should now correctly compare the BlockManagers.
