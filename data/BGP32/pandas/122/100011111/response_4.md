### Bug Fix Strategy:
The issue arises from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. In the provided buggy function, the sorting is causing a problem when comparing blocks with the same data but different locations. To fix this bug, we should change the sorting criteria to consider the block's data values for equality comparison, not their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Expected Output:
The corrected function should now return `False` for the provided failing test case where `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

By changing the sorting criteria to use the block's data values, we ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
