### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, their axes, and blocks. 
2. The error message shows that the assertion failure is due to `assert True is False`, indicating that the comparison returned `True` when it should have been `False`.
3. The runtime values and expected values show that the comparison is incorrectly evaluating to `True`, which is leading to the assertion failure.
4. The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` which should be compared correctly to determine equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` considers the values of the axes, not just their references. By comparing the values within the axes, we can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals` function to correctly compare the axes values, we ensure the accurate comparison of `BlockManager` objects, resolving the bug.
