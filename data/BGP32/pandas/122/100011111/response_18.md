### Analysis:
The failing test is checking if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals()` function. The test is expecting the function to return False since the DataFrames have different values. However, the current implementation seems to return True instead, leading to the test failure.

Looking at the code, the issue could potentially arise in the `canonicalize` function, where blocks are sorted based on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`. If two identical blocks with different `mgr_locs` are present in DataFrames, the equality check might fail.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not consider the actual content of the blocks. It only sorts them based on type name and `mgr_locs`, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks as well, along with type name and `mgr_locs`. This way, identical blocks with different `mgr_locs` will be correctly identified as different.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` now includes the block values in addition to type name and `mgr_locs`. This enhanced comparison should correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different `mgr_locs` and ensure the proper equality comparison.
