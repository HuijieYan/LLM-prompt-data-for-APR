### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by considering the axes and blocks. If the lengths of the axes are different or if any of the axes are not equal, the function should return `False`.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are compared. The function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might not be the correct criteria for equality comparison.
3. The failing test is checking if two DataFrames with swapped data in columns are equal, but the function erroneously returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to determine a more appropriate way to compare the blocks and ensure that the function correctly identifies the data mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. Modify the comparison in the function to properly check for equality between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Updated Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update canonicalize function to compare blocks based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, FloatBlock):
            return block.get_values()
        elif isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual data content, the corrected function should now properly check for DataFrame equality even when the columns' data values are swapped.
