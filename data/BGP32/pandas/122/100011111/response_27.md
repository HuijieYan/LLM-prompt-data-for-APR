### Analysis:
The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue stems from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, assuming that this is sufficient to identify the blocks uniquely.

### Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect comparison logic in the canonicalization of block order. It mistakenly sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect outcomes when two blocks have identical `dtype.name` but different `mgr_locs`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block canonicalization method to ensure blocks are uniquely identified. We can add additional information for comparison or ensure blocks are sorted based on their complete properties.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order based on block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._verify_integrity()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use `_verify_integrity` to uniquely identify blocks, we ensure that comparisons are made with all relevant block information. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to correctly compare `BlockManager` objects.
