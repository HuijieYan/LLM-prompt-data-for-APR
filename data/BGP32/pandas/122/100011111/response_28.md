### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The failing test involves comparing two DataFrames with columns swapped. This suggests a problem with the comparison logic in the function when blocks are in different locations.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic inside the function.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison logic failing to handle cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations. Since the function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, the comparison can yield an incorrect result when the content is the same but the locations differ.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider cases where the blocks have identical content but are at different locations. One approach could be to additionally check for matching contents before comparing dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other_blocks) for block in self_blocks
    )
```

This corrected version improves the block comparison by first checking if there is any matching block in the other blocks before considering dtype and locations. This change should address the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
