### Analysis:
The function `equals` is intended to compare two data structures and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly even when the two inputs are not equal, causing the test to fail. This is a critical bug as it affects the correctness of the comparison operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison logic within the function. Even though the axes are correctly compared and the blocks are sorted and compared, the comparison logic within the `zip` function may not be working as expected. This could be due to incorrect matching of blocks during the iteration which leads to incorrect equal comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic within the `zip` function accurately matches each corresponding block for comparison. Additionally, if the blocks are the same but located at different positions, the function should still identify them as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected version includes modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the binary representation of block values for better identification.
2. By using `block.values.tobytes()`, we ensure that even if the contents are the same but their locations differ, they will be identified as not equal.
3. This modification addresses the issue raised in the failing test, where blocks with identical values but swapped locations were incorrectly deemed equal.
