### Analysis:
The `equals` function is expected to return `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have different values in corresponding cells. However, the current implementation is not behaving as expected and returns `True` incorrectly.

The issue reported on GitHub states that the function `equals` wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Identification:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in the DataFrames. When sorting the blocks by type name and locations to canonicalize them, the function compares these sorted blocks. Due to the sort order, the comparison may lead to incorrect results, especially when blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between blocks should not rely on their sorted order but instead directly compare the blocks based on their content. We should ensure that the comparison is correct regardless of the blocks' order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the DataFrames `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we eliminate the issue of incorrect results due to sorted block orders. This corrected version should fix the bug and address the reported GitHub issue.
