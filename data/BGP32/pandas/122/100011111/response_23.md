### Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This implies that the function is not correctly identifying the differing DataFrames.

In the provided buggy function, the issue likely arises from the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, intending to find differences. However, due to how the blocks are compared, even if the data within the blocks is different, they may still be considered equal if their identifying characteristics match.

To resolve this bug, a more precise comparison mechanism needs to be implemented that takes into account the actual data within the blocks and considers them different if the data itself differs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Iterate over each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
2. Compare the data within each corresponding pair of blocks.
3. If the data is not equal, return `False` immediately.
4. If all comparisons pass without finding any differences, return `True`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for (block, oblock) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected function directly compares the data within each block and returns `False` if any differences are found. This approach ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of the two DataFrames by considering their actual content.
