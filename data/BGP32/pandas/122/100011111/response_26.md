### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given test case.
2. The function compares two BlockManagers by checking if they have equal axes and blocks. However, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect comparison of blocks due to different locations.
3. The provided runtime values show that the function fails to correctly compare the locations of the blocks, leading to an erroneous result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual content and not just the location.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])  # Sort blocks based on the first value for comparison
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their first values, we ensure a proper comparison regardless of their original locations. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
