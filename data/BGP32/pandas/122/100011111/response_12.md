### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks but with different locations. This behavior is not expected and is failing the test case provided.

The function compares the axes of the two DataFrames first, then checks if all the blocks are equal. If any blocks have the same content but different locations, the function should not return `True`.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the comparison process using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. If the blocks have the same content but different locations, they will still be considered equal based on this sorting approach.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, instead of comparing the blocks solely based on dtype and mgr_locs, we should compare the actual values within the blocks to determine equality. We can achieve this by iterating through the blocks in both DataFrames and comparing their content directly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block_loc, block in self.blocks.items():
        if block_loc not in other.blocks:
            return False
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[block_loc]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version iterates through the blocks in `self` and compares them with the corresponding blocks in `other`. If any block does not match or is missing in either DataFrame, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after comparing all blocks.
