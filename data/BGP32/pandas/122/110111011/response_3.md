### Explanation of the Bug:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises from the way the function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances. The specific issues are:
1. The function checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, but it doesn't compare the actual values of the axes.
2. The function compares the blocks based on their order, which is causing the equality check to fail in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality check properly compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances without relying on block order. Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Compare the axes of `self` and `other` to ensure they are equal.
2. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on a canonical sorting order that doesn't rely on block locations.
3. Compare the sorted blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.dtypes))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.dtypes))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Explanation:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now sorts the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on a combination of their type and dtype. This ensures that the blocks are compared in a consistent order, eliminating the issue of different block locations causing false inequality. The function now correctly checks if the axes are equal, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the sorted blocks for equality, addressing the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
