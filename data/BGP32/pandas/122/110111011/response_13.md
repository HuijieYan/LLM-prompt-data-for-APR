### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `equals` function arises from an incorrect comparison between blocks when checking for equality. The function compares the blocks based on their dtype names and `mgr_locs`, but this approach can lead to incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This causes the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison strategy in the `equals` function to ensure that identical blocks are correctly detected as equal. One approach is to compare the actual values of the blocks rather than their dtype names and locations.

### Corrected Version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values of the blocks directly, the corrected function should now correctly return `False` for `df1.equals(df2)` in the failing test case.
