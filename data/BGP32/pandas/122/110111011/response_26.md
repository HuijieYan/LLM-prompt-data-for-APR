### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from comparing blocks within the `self` and `other` instances without accounting for potential differences in block locations. The comparison depends on the order of blocks and their locations, resulting in incorrect equality evaluations even when the blocks have the same content.

The `equals` method first checks whether the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`. Next, it compares each axis in `self_axes` with the corresponding axis in `other_axes` using the `equals` method. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`. 

Then, the method consolidates both `self` and `other` instances in place, ensuring that they are in a consistent state for comparison. After consolidation, it checks if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` instances are equal. If not, it returns `False`.

The bug surfaces during the comparison of blocks. It does not consider potential differences in block locations, causing blocks with the same content to be evaluated as unequal if they are not in the same order.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare blocks based on their content rather than their order or location. Reordering the blocks for comparison purposes can lead to incorrect equality evaluations when the block locations differ.

One possible strategy to address the bug is to directly compare the contents of blocks in `self` and `other` instances without sorting or reordering. By comparing the blocks based on their data, the method can accurately determine equality irrespective of block order or location.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the method compares blocks directly without sorting them based on their locations. This modification ensures that blocks with the same content are correctly evaluated as equal regardless of their order.
