### Explanation of the bug

The bug is in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises because of how blocks are sorted and compared for equality. When comparing blocks, the function sorts blocks based on their data type and location, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `pd.DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` are created with the same columns but different data values. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.

The failing test fails because the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class incorrectly compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. The sorting and comparison of blocks based on data type and location do not accurately reflect the equality of DataFrame objects for different data values.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared for equality in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Instead of sorting blocks based on data type and location, we should compare the actual data values within the blocks to determine equality.

We can achieve this by directly comparing the blocks' values in a row-wise manner, ensuring that the data values match between the two `BlockManager` objects. This approach will accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their actual data values rather than their location or data type.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Compare each block for equality based on data values
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare the values of each block in the `BlockManager` objects to determine equality. This approach ensures that the `equals` function correctly identifies whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their actual data values.
