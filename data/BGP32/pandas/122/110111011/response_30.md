The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The blocks are not being compared correctly due to the way they are sorted and checked for equality. 

Explanation of the bug:
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
- Sorting the blocks this way may lead to incorrect comparisons since blocks with the same content but different locations may not be recognized as equal.
- This discrepancy causes the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to consider the block content only and ignore the block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on dtype name to ensure correct comparison
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks))
```

This correction involved removing the `canonicalize` function and sorting the blocks based on their values directly to ensure correct comparison.

After applying this correction, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
