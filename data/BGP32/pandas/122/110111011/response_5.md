### Explanation of the bug

The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class which is used internally in Pandas. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the method checks if the axes are equal, then consolidates the data internally in both instances and finally compares the blocks present in each instance based on their type and location information.

The bug arises from the fact that in the original implementation, the consolidation of the data within the `BlockManager` instances, which is meant to align the blocks for comparison, occurs after the equality check on the axes. This causes the comparison to fail when two identical blocks in different locations are actually considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the consolidation of the data in both `BlockManager` instances should be done before comparing the axes and blocks. This way, the data in each `BlockManager` will be aligned properly for a meaningful comparison, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Consolidate data before axis and block comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the data consolidation step (`_consolidate_inplace()`) is performed before comparing the axes and blocks in both `BlockManager` instances. This ensures that the data is properly aligned for accurate comparison and resolves the bug causing incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
