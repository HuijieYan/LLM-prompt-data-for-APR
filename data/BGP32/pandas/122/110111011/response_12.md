### Explanation:
1. The buggy `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates the objects to ensure consistent comparison, checks the number of blocks, and finally compares each block.
   
2. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in the function. The function sorts the blocks based on a combination of their dtype name and `mgr_locs` locations before comparing. However, the bug occurs because the code only considers the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, which may vary even when the data inside the blocks is the same.

3. The failing test case creates two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, with columns `a` and `b` containing different but comparable data. It then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False` since the data in the two DataFrames is not the same, leading to the AssertionError.
   
   The error message indicates that `True` is being compared against `False`, indicating that the function incorrectly returns `True`. This behavior is unintended.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and the actual data within the blocks, ensuring that similar blocks are correctly identified even if their `mgr_locs` differ.

### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to consider block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function creates a hash combining the block data and dtype name for comparison within the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that the actual content of the blocks is considered when determining equality, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.
