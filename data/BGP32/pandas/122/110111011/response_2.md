### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class occurs due to blocks with identical data but different locations being considered unequal. This results in the function incorrectly returning `False`. The comparison between blocks should be based on the contents of the blocks rather than the locations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple of the block's content (values) and data type. This change ensures that blocks with the same data and data type are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(
            ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
        ):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly compare the blocks based on their content (values) and data type, ensuring that blocks with the same data are considered equal.
