### Explanation of the Bug
The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks. However, the bug causes the comparison to always return `True` even when the objects are not equal. This bug is manifested in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

#### Issue in the Code:
1. The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are being sorted based on a key generated by the `canonicalize` function, which uses `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as part of the key. This causes the blocks to be sorted incorrectly, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the ordering of blocks needs to be consistent for equality comparison. Avoid using the `mgr_locs` attribute for sorting, as it can introduce inconsistencies in block order. Instead, sort the blocks based on a key that uniquely identifies each block.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version does not rely on `mgr_locs` for sorting the blocks and instead uses the `values` attribute for comparison to achieve consistent block ordering.
