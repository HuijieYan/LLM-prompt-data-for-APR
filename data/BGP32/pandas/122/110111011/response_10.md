### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different order and expects them to be unequal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion that `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
4. The runtime values show that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks and locations is not handling the order of the blocks correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both block values and manager locations when comparing blocks.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using block values and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should correctly identify differences in block order and locations, thus passing the failing test case.
