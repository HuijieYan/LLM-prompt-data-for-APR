### Explanation of the Bug

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is supposed to check the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises when comparing blocks due to an incorrect canonicalization process.

When comparing blocks for equality, the function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization key, which combines the type name and manager locations of the blocks. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparison results when blocks have the same content but different locations.

In the failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with identical data but in different column orders. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, the function erroneously returns `True` instead of the expected `False` due to how the blocks are sorted and compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To address this bug, we need to modify the canonicalization process to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly detected as not equal. We can achieve this by updating the canonicalize function to consider content equality along with their type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Check if axes are equal
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check if the number of blocks is equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content equality instead of just sorting and comparing
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to include the block values along with the type name. It then compares the block values and types to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as not equal. With this modification, the `equals` function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test.
