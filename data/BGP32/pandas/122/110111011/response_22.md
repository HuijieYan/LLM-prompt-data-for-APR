### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the bug causes the method to incorrectly return `True` even when the two `BlockManager` objects have different block order, resulting in failing the test.

The issue arises from how the blocks are sorted before comparison. The code sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and manager locations of the block. If there are unconsolidated blocks with the same type name, they can have different manager locations, leading to incorrect sorting and subsequent equality check failures.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly handles unconsolidated blocks. Instead of relying solely on block manager locations for sorting, we should consider additional criteria to distinguish blocks with the same type name.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method in `BlockManager`
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, `equals` method now sorts the blocks based on both the dtype name and block values before comparing them, ensuring a correct comparison even in the presence of unconsolidated blocks. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue as the DataFrame objects with differing block orders will be correctly identified as not equal.
