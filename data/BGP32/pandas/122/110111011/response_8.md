### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and then iterating over their blocks to check if they are equal or not.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two dataframes with columns of different types and values, which should not be considered equal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion expects the `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not properly consider the content of the blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. It only compares the block types (`dtype`) and manager locations which leads to the wrong result.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing the blocks based only on the block type (`dtype.name`) and the manager locations (`mgr_locs`). This comparison does not take into consideration the actual contents of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare the contents of the blocks in addition to their types and locations. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the blocks directly using the `equals()` method of the blocks themselves, we ensure that the content of the blocks is considered in the equality check. This correction should make the `equals()` function behave correctly for the given failing test case.
