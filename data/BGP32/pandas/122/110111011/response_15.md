### Potential Error Locations
1. The check for the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of axes using `all` and `zip`.
3. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize`.

### Cause of the Bug
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. These DataFrames have the same column names `["a", "b"]` but the values are different. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` since the DataFrames are not equal.

The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares the axes of `self` and `other` DataFrames, as well as their blocks. The comparison using `all` and `zip` on the axes might miss detecting the inequality when the blocks are in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic compares the values of the blocks effectively. Sorting the blocks based on a more detailed key, such as the type name and the block location, can help in correctly identifying the differences between DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the full location array of `mgr_locs` by converting it to bytes, ensuring a unique representation for each block. This will help in correctly comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` DataFrames.
