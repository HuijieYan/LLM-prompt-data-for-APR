### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances by iterating over their axes and blocks attributes. 
- The bug occurs when comparing the blocks attribute due to the sorting mechanism based on the location of blocks which leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
- The failing test case checks for inequality between two DataFrames based on the order of columns in the DataFrames, which the current implementation of `equals` does not handle correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
- The failing test case creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects them to be unequal.
- The buggy `equals` function compares the blocks of two BlockManager instances by sorting them based on the block's data type and coordinates.
- The sorting based on the block's coordinates can lead to incorrect results when the block positions differ between the compared BlockManagers.
- This inconsistency results in the failing test case reporting a false positive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data type only for sorting, not the block's positions.
- This modification will ensure a correct comparison of identical block contents, regardless of their location in the BlockManagers.
- By sorting based on the block's data type only, we will prevent false positives in the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on data types only, we ensure that the comparison considers the contents of the blocks correctly, resulting in a passing test case and fixing the reported bug.
