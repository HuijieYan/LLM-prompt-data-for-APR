### Identified Bug:

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the contents of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks within these instances, where the order of blocks can vary due to unconsolidated blocks, causing the comparison logic to fail.

### Cause of the Bug:

1. The function compares the blocks without considering different block locations, leading to incorrect results.
2. The sorting of blocks is based on the type name and manager locations, which may not be consistent across different `BlockManager` instances.

### Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the internal data structure more accurately. One approach could be to compare the data within each block directly, ensuring that the order and indexing of blocks don't affect the comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = (self_blocks, self.blocks)
    other_blocks = (other_blocks, other.blocks)
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare each block from `self` to the corresponding block in `other` directly. This ensures a more reliable comparison and avoids the issue of inconsistent block ordering.
