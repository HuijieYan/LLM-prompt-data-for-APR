### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two `pd.DataFrame` instances that have the same columns but different order, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` erroneously.
4. The provided runtime input values show that the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances are being compared correctly. However, the comparison logic within the `equals` function is flawed, as it's not handling the case where the blocks have the same data but different positions.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that this is indeed an existing bug and provides expected behavior for the test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function failing to account for the different ordering of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the block data within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, consider both type name and actual data
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (block, block.block_values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (block, block.block_values))

    return all(self_block.block_values.equals(other_block.block_values)
               for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version incorporates the data comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances while still considering the axes for equality. This revised logic should correctly handle scenarios where blocks have the same data but differ in their positions.
