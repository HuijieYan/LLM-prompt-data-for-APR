### Buggy Function Analysis:
The provided `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.

### Bug Identification:
1. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
2. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared using the `equals` method, which might not adequately handle different locations of identical blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, where the columns have switched positions between the two DataFrames. This swap in column positions causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` because the comparison logic does not consider block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to consider the locations of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to account for block locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. The `canonicalize` function has been updated to include the locations of the blocks by converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple.
2. The blocks in `self` and `other` are sorted based on the updated `canonicalize` function, which considers block locations.
3. The comparison of blocks now includes the block locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly deemed equal.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects and handle cases with identical blocks in different locations.
