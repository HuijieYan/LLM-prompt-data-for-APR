### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types and values and expects them to be not equal.
4. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have been `False`.
5. The provided runtime input/output values suggest that the function incorrectly determines the equality by comparing blocks with different locations. This leads to a faulty comparison and incorrect results.
6. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem of `equals` wrongly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which aligns with the observed behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks based on their types and locations. When two `BlockManager` instances have blocks with the same data but different locations, the sorting based on `canonicalize` function does not ensure correct equality.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic so that it correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` instances are equal. This may involve revising the way blocks are compared and considering the actual data content rather than the block location.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by sorting blocks based on their actual content values for comparison, ensuring that the equality comparison is done correctly.
