### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` class incorrectly. It is sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` method that combines the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting does not account for the correct comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.
2. The actual comparison between the blocks is done in the last return statement, comparing each block individually using the `equals` method. However, the earlier sorting based on `canonicalize` can lead to incorrect comparisons.
3. The failing test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` because the blocks are structurally different, but due to the incorrect sorting based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, the function is returning `True` instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` method as it introduces an incorrect comparison between blocks.
2. Keep the comparison logic intact, where each block is compared individually using the `equals` method.
3. Ensure that the order of blocks remains the same as they are stored in the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By removing the unnecessary sorting based on `canonicalize` and directly comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.
