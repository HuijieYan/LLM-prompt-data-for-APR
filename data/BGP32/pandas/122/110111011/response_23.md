## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` uses `DataFrame.equals()` to compare two DataFrames.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, pointing to incorrect equality comparison.
4. The bug arises due to incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class.
5. The `runtime values and types` provided indicate that the existing comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect equality evaluations.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises because the `equals` method compares blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances based on their type names and locations. However, the implementation fails to consider the case where identical blocks might have different locations. This results in incorrectly evaluating equality between the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be updated to account for cases where identical blocks may have different locations. One approach could be to compare the block contents directly instead of relying solely on block types and locations. This change will ensure accurate equality comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now accurately compare the block contents of the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring correct equality evaluation.
