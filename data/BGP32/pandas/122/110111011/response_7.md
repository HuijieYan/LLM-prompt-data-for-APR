### Error Analysis:
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the current implementation fails to compare the blocks correctly due to the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and manager locations, which can lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks have the same content but with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `equals` function calls the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks but does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the sorting mechanism to compare the content of the blocks instead of just the dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting them based on dtype or manager locations.

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct result, passing the failing test and resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.
