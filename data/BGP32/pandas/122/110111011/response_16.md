### Explanation of the bug:

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes are equal and whether all blocks within them are equal. The bug arises due to the function not considering the actual values of the blocks while comparing them for equality.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame instances `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same column names. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, the `BlockManager.equals` function fails to correctly identify the difference in values between the blocks inside `df1` and `df2`, ultimately leading to an incorrect evaluation of equality.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of just their data types and locations. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks and comparing the values within each corresponding pair of blocks.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
            return False
        return True
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the actual values within the blocks using NumPy's `np.array_equal` function to identify differences accurately. This modification ensures that the function will correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their actual data values.
