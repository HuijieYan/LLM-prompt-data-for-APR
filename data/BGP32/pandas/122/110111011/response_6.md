The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison should consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations. Here's how the bug can be fixed:

1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the content of the blocks instead of their locations.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content, not their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now correctly compares the content of the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations resulting in `equals` incorrectly returning `True`.
