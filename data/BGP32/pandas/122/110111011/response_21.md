### Explanation of the Bug

The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. In the failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' are created with values of different types in different columns.

The `equals` method is expected to return `False` when the two DataFrames have different content. However, due to the bug in the method, it mistakenly returns `True` in cases where the blocks are equal in content but have different locations.

The issue is caused by the comparison of self and other BlockManagers within the `equals` method. The comparison logic does not correctly handle cases where the block content is identical but the block locations are different. This results in the method incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` method to properly account for cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations. We should ensure that block equality is based on content rather than location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content1, block_content2) 
        for block_content1, block_content2 in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

By comparing the block values directly, we ensure that the equality check considers the content of the blocks rather than their locations. This correction should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and make the `equals` method behave as intended.
