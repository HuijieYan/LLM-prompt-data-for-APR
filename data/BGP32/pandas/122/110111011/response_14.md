### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic does not take into account the actual data within the blocks but rather focuses on structure which leads to incorrect outcomes.

1. The code first compares the axes of `self` and `other`. If the axes are not equal, it directly returns `False`.
2. It then attempts to consolidate the blocks of both `self` and `other`.
3. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks of `self` and `other`. If they are not equal, it directly returns `False`.
4. It then sorts and compares individual blocks based on dtype name and manager locations.

In the failing test provided, `df1` and `df2` have axes that are identical but the data within the blocks is different. The buggy function does not take into account this data comparison, leading to an incorrect assertion.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To correct this bug, the function should compare the actual data inside the blocks rather than just comparing axes and block structures. This will ensure that the comparison correctly identifies differences in the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare data in blocks instead of just block structure
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By comparing the actual block data instead of just block structure, the corrected version of the function now correctly identifies differences in the data within the `BlockManager` objects. This correction should resolve the issue with the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
