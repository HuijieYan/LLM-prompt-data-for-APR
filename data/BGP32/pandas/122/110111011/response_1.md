### Explanation of the Bug

1. In the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is causing the bug.
2. The bug lies in the sorting mechanism of the blocks using `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type name and the manager locations. This sorting is done to ensure consistent block order for comparison.
3. The bug arises when there are blocks with identical data but different locations (like the scenario mentioned in the failing test). Despite the content being the same, the blocks are treated as different due to their locations.
4. As a result, the function wrongly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with the same data but block positions swapped, causing the test to fail.

### Fixed Version

To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism so that it considers block content only for equality checks, ignoring block positions. This way, DataFrames with identical block content will return `False` as expected when using the `equals` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on data type name only, ignoring manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.block_type

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the block comparison is based solely on the data type names, leading to correct behavior and passing the failing test case.
