### Explanation:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue in the current implementation lies in the comparison of blocks. The blocks are sorted using a custom function `canonicalize`, which combines the dtype name and manager locations of each block into a tuple. This sorting mechanism aims to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly.

However, the comparison of blocks using `equals` function does not consider the fact that the blocks might be identical but in different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to account for cases where blocks are identical but have different locations. One approach can be to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.data, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made in the Corrected Version:
1. The `canonicalize` function now generates the tuple using the block's data and dtype name.
2. Sorting is done based on the block's content and dtype to handle cases where blocks are the same but in different locations.
3. The comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` now considers the actual content of the blocks for equality.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case mentioned.

By applying these modifications, the function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects for equality without considering differences in block locations.
