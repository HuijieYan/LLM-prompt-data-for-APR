The buggy function is trying to compare two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and blocks' content equality. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks. 

The bug seems to be caused by the way the `canonicalize` function is handling sorting of blocks. The `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is expected to be a list, but it's being converted to a list of lists using `tolist()` which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we do not attempt to convert `mgr_locs` to a list using `tolist()`. We should directly use the `mgr_locs` attribute as a tuple in the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue with comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects properly.
