### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class due to incorrect comparison of internal blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function is comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, sorting them based on their type name and locs, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by comparing blocks based on their content rather than their type name and locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in the same order for both `BlockManager` instances, ensuring an accurate comparison based on content rather than sorting based on type and locs.
