### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is returning a tuple of the block's data type name (`block.dtype.name`) and the locations of the block (`block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`). This sorting is leading to incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the dtype, shape, and values of the block for comparison instead of just the data type name and locations. By making this change, we can ensure that the blocks are properly compared for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.shape, block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
