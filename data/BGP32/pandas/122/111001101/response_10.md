## Bug Explanation
In the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, the bug arises from the way blocks are being compared for equality. The function compares the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but the comparison logic is flawed. The bug is specifically triggered when sorting the blocks based on the canonicalization function, which leads to incorrect equality checks between the blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly compare the blocks for equality based on their content rather than just their dtype name and mgr_locs. The comparison should involve checking the values within the blocks to ensure they are equal.

## Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now properly compares the blocks for equality based on their content rather than relying on sorting and dtype names. This should resolve the bug and ensure correct equality comparisons between `BlockManager` instances.
