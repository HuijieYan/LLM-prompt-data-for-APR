The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The comparison logic for blocks should be handled using the appropriate method rather than directly comparing the blocks' components. The `canonicalize` function tries to create a tuple representation of a block based on its dtype and manager locations, but the comparison made for equality is flawed.

To fix the bug, the comparison between blocks should be done using the `equals` method provided by the `Block` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, blocks are sorted using a custom key function `_block_key` which should be a determined key for each block type. Then, the blocks are compared using the `equals` method.

This fix ensures that the comparison between blocks is done correctly based on their content and types, addressing the bug in the previous implementation.
