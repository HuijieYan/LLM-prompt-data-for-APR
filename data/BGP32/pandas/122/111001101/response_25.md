### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without ensuring that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner before comparison. The comparison relies on the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, which can lead to incorrect results due to unsorted blocks.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function compares the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without ensuring a consistent order of blocks for comparison. This can lead to false negatives when the blocks are not in a predictable order for comparison.
2. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs`. However, the implementation does not correctly access the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
3. When sorting the blocks using `canonicalize`, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly using `as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we need to ensure that both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted consistently before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently for comparison, reducing the chance of false negatives in the `equals` function.
