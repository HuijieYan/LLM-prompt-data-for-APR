### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises from the comparison of blocks. The function is trying to sort and compare the blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes, but the `dtype` is being accessed incorrectly leading to an error.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. Specifically, the `block.dtype.name` is being accessed incorrectly, causing the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by trying to access the `dtype` attribute directly on `block`, which is an instance of a block type like `IntBlock`. To correctly access the dtype attribute, we need to retrieve it from the block's internal data.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, retrieve the `dtype` attribute by first accessing the data within the block, since `dtype` is a property of the data stored in the block.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary
By making the necessary adjustment to correctly retrieve the dtype attribute within the `canonicalize` function, the bug in the `equals` method has been fixed. This correction ensures that blocks are sorted and compared based on their dtype and mgr_locs attributes, allowing for a proper comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
