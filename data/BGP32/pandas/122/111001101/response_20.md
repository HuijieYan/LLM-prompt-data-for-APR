The bug in the provided function is likely due to the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. The function is comparing the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which may not be consistent for all block types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. One approach is to compare the blocks directly based on their values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the values of the blocks directly instead of using the `equals` method. This should ensure a more accurate comparison of the blocks and fix the bug.
