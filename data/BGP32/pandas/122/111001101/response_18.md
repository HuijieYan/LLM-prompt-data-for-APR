The bug in the given function lies in the sorting of blocks. The function is attempting to compare two BlockManager objects by sorting the blocks based on their types and locations. However, the bug arises from using the `canonicalize` function incorrectly, leading to incorrect block ordering and causing the function to return False even when the BlockManager objects are equal.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype and locations of the blocks. Additionally, we should ensure that the sorting is based on the dtype and locations of the blocks to accurately compare the two BlockManager objects.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to extract the block type's name and their locations correctly. The blocks are then sorted based on these values to ensure that the comparison between the two BlockManager objects is done accurately.
