### Analysis
The buggy function is comparing two instances of the BlockManager class by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them in place, and finally comparing their blocks. The bug seems to arise from the sorting of the blocks before comparison.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the sorting key used to sort the blocks is based on the `dtype.name` of the block and its `mgr_locs.as_array` attribute. In the provided runtime values, the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` have swapped positions in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers, causing the sorting to be incorrect and leading to a false negative comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting key so that it considers the block's position and type to do a fair comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using the type of the block to create the sorting key in addition to the `mgr_locs.as_array` to ensure a proper comparison of blocks is made. This modification should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result.
