### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the blocks correctly because it is sorting the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which might not be the appropriate way to distinguish the block equality. This sorting mechanism can cause the comparison to fail even when the blocks are equal. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than their dtype name and manager locations. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks directly using the `equals` method provided in the blocks.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version directly compares each block using their `equals` method to determine equality.
