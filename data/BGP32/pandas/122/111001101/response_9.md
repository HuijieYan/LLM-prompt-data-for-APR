### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to occur when comparing the blocks. It sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a `canonicalize` function, but there seems to be an issue when defining and comparing blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined to return a tuple with the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` are not valid attributes or methods for the `block` object.
2. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access these attributes, leading to a failure in the comparison between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly represent the block for comparison.
2. Use attributes/methods that are valid for the `block` object.
3. Ensure that the comparison logic compares relevant attributes of the blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.fname)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to represent the block correctly, the comparison logic should work as expected. This will prevent the AttributeError and ensure accurate comparison between blocks.
