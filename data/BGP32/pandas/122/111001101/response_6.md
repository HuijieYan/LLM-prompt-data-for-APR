### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a comparison issue related to the `block` object within the function. The function sorts the blocks based on a custom key generated by the `canonicalize` function, which combines the dtype name of the block with its manager locations. However, the manager locations are compared in the form of a list since the `as_array.tolist()` call converts the manager locations into a list of integers. This list comparison is causing the bug as it is comparing different data structures with different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison between manager locations should be done directly without converting them to a list. The comparison should be based on the actual manager locations objects to ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the dtype name and the manager locations object directly, without converting to a list. This ensures that the comparison between blocks happens correctly by comparing the manager locations objects directly.
