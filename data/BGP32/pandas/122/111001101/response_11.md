### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The bug arises when sorting the blocks to compare them. In the current implementation, the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks creates a tuple combining the type name (block.dtype.name) and the location of the block (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()). However, the `canonicalize` function does not provide a deterministic sorting mechanism for blocks due to using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to provide a more deterministic sorting mechanism for the blocks. One way to achieve this is by using the block's data values for sorting. This ensures that blocks with the same data values are considered equal even if their locations differ.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values().tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now uses the block's data values (block.get_values().tostring()) for sorting.
- This change ensures a deterministic sorting mechanism for the blocks, improving the equality comparison between `BlockManager` objects.
