### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function checks if the number of axes is the same, then consolidates the data inplace, compares the number of blocks, sorts the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`, and then checks if each block is equal.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
4. The issue might be with the way blocks are being compared for equality.
   
### Bug:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares the blocks for equality using the `equals` method, which might not be the appropriate method for comparison. It is likely that the `equals` method is not properly implemented for the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function to ensure correct comparison.
2. Check if custom `equals` method is implemented for the blocks. If not, implement one or use an appropriate method for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version updates the `canonicalize` function to use `block.values` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for comparison. It also compares the blocks using the `equals` method which should be implemented correctly for accurate comparison.
