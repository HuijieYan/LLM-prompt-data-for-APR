### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The function first compares the number of axes in both instances, then checks if each axis is equal, consolidates the instances in place, and finally compares the blocks within the instances.
3. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks because it sorts the blocks based on a `canonicalize` function which compares the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of each block, and then checks if the sorted blocks are equal.
4. The bug is likely due to the fact that the comparison of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may not accurately represent the equality of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of relying on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for block comparison, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to directly compare the blocks.
2. We can compare the blocks based on their values and dimensions rather than their type names and specific locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()  # Compare blocks based on values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the block values in the corrected version, we ensure a more accurate comparison for the `BlockManager` instances.
