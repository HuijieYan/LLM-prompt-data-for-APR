### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes in both instances is the same. Then, it checks if the axes are equal by iterating over them.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `self.blocks` attribute is being compared between the two instances. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` as an array. This comparison logic is flawed causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.
4. The strategy to fix the bug would involve ensuring that the comparison of blocks between the two instances is done correctly based on their content rather than their type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing the corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
