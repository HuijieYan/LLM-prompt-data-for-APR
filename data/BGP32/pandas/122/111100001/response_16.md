## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The potential error location is with the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
3. The buggy function fails to correctly compare blocks because the ordering of the blocks may differ between the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in the correct order without relying on their index position.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for key in self_blocks:
        if key not in other_blocks or not self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]):
            return False

    return True
``` 

## After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, passing the failing test case.
