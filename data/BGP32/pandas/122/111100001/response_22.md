## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class checks if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes, blocks, and values.
- The function first compares the axes of the two objects and consolidates them in place before comparing the blocks.
- The comparison of blocks is done by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, and then checking if each block is equal with the corresponding block in the other object.

## Identified Issue:
- The bug in the `equals` function is due to the incorrect comparison of data blocks in the `BlockManager` objects. The blocks are expected to be sorted based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` are converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on a tuple of dtype name and `mgr_locs` directly without converting `mgr_locs` to a list.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using a tuple of dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this fix, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class should now compare the `BlockManager` objects correctly based on their blocks and pass the failing test.
