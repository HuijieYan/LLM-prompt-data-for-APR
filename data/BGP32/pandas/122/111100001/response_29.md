### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class for equality based on their internal blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared and sorted.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames with columns in different orders, expecting a result of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the logic used to compare the blocks in different instances of `BlockManager`. The function is sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which may not accurately represent the equality of the underlying data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to compare the blocks in a more robust way.
2. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on type name and manager locations, compare the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on actual data
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the blocks inside the `BlockManager` instances based on their actual data instead of just type names and manager locations. This should resolve the bug and make the function correctly determine equality between two instances of `BlockManager`.
