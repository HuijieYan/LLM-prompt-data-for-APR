### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic used to check if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, which internally calls the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison logic in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic to properly compare the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how it compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic first sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple of type name and manager locations to compare blocks. The bug likely occurs when the sorting and subsequent comparison of the blocks do not result in the correct equality comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals` function needs to be modified to accurately compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks directly rather than sorting and comparing based on a tuple of type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare blocks directly
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
