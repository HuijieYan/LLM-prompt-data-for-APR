### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class to see if they are equal.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
3. The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which may not be handling the comparison correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly based on their dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Correction:
```python
# Fixed version of the equals function in the BlockManager class

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to compare blocks
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks using canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `compare_blocks` function to compare the blocks and properly sorting them based on dtype name and mgr_locs, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test provided.
