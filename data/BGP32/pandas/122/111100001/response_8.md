The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it handles the comparison of blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. Specifically, the bug occurs because the function tries to canonicalize the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but there is no guarantee that this canonicalization method will always work correctly for all block types.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure a more robust way of comparing the blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. One way to do this is to iterate over each block in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and compare them individually. This approach ensures a direct comparison of corresponding blocks without relying on sorting and canonicalization.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the provided failing test function should now pass without any issues.
