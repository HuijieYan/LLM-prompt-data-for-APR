## Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises due to a mismatch in the data types of the columns in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that are being compared. The `equals` function is defined to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects, which internally hold different `blocks` of data. When comparing the `blocks` of the two `BlockManager` instances, the function uses the `block.equals(oblock)` method to check if each block is equal.

In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are being compared using the `equals` method. The data types of the columns are swapped between the two DataFrames, resulting in a `False` assertion. The data types of the columns should match for the DataFrames to be considered equal. The bug in the `equals` function does not account for this scenario and incorrectly returns `True`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to check for column data type matches before comparing the blocks. If the data types do not match between corresponding columns in the two `BlockManager` instances, the function should return `False`.

## Corrected version of the `equals` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function incorporating the data type matching check:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Check if data types match for corresponding blocks
        if set(block.dtype for block in self.blocks) != set(block.dtype for block in other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now checks for matching data types between corresponding blocks before comparing them, ensuring that the function behaves correctly even when columns have different data types.
