### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes, blocks, and block order are equal between the two instances.
3. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks part where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting may not work correctly for all block types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers all possible cases and properly handles the sorting for different block types.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By using `type(block).__name__` instead of `block.dtype.name` in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that the block types are properly compared during sorting. This correction should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
