### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function is comparing the axes, consolidating the blocks, and then comparing the blocks for equality.

### Identified Issue:
The bug in the current implementation might be due to the comparing of columns with different data types in the blocks present in `df1` and `df2` DataFrames. The bug is likely causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison of the blocks which are sorted using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is using the data type name of the block and the `mgr_locs` of the block to create a tuple for sorting. If the blocks contain columns with different data types but similar names, they might be sorted in a way that causes the comparison to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle columns with different data types properly. We can either modify the sorting logic, or implement a more robust comparison logic to handle these cases.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting based on data type names and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should fix the bug and pass the failing test.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `equals` function may need to take into account additional edge cases and considerations depending on the specific requirements of the `BlockManager` class.
