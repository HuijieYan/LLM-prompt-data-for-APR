### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic implemented in the function.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that two dataframes with columns in different orders are not equal.
4. The buggy function fails to properly handle the comparison of blocks when the order of columns is different between the two dataframes. 
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to sort the blocks based on the canonicalize function that considers the dtype name and mgr_locs of the blocks to ensure consistent ordering for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.data.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrected version using `str(block.dtype)` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.data.tobytes()` within the canonicalize function, the comparison should now handle different column orders correctly. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test case.
