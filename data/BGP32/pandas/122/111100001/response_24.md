### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class.
2. The `equals` function is comparing the axes, consolidating the data inplace, comparing the number of blocks, sorting the blocks based on type name and locations, and finally comparing each block between the two `BlockManager` instances.
3. The bug in the function is likely due to the sorting of blocks based on type name and locations. This sorting may not produce the desired comparison result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a more meaningful way that ensures the comparison is accurate.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on block index rather than dtype name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block._item_index)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block._item_index)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on block index rather than dtype name and locations, we ensure a meaningful comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
