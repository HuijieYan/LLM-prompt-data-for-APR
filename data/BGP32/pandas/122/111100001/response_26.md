The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. The issue in the buggy code lies in the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. The comparison is not correctly handling the case where the blocks are not ordered in the same way.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique identifier for each block based on both the dtype name and the `mgr_locs`. This should ensure that the comparison is done accurately for different block orders.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test provided should now pass.
