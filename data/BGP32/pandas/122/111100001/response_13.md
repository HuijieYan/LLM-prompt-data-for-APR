### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same.
3. Then, it compares each axis using the `equals` method of the axis objects.
4. After that, it consolidates both objects in place.
5. It then checks if the number of blocks in both objects is the same.
6. The function then tries to canonicalize the block order based on block type and manager locations.
7. Finally, it compares each block in both objects for equality based on the canonicalized order.

### Issues:
1. The function is defined twice in the class `equals(self, other)`.
2. The first implementation of `equals` method does not have the correct logic for comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The logic inside the second implementation is not handling the comparison correctly, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `equals` method. The comparison logic for blocks is not accurate, resulting in incorrect test results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rewrite the logic of the `equals` method to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects.
2. Ensure that the axes, blocks, and their order are properly accounted for during the comparison.
3. Correctly handle the block type and manager locations for proper canonicalization and equality checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Code Explanation:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to convert block type and manager locations to strings for easier comparison.
2. Correctly sort the blocks based on the modified canonicalize function.
3. Compare each block in both objects for equality after sorting.

After applying these changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test.
