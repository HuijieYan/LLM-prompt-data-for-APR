### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.
2. The function compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates the internal data structures of both objects, compares the number of blocks, and finally compares the blocks themselves.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks in a non-deterministic order due to the sorting mechanism used.
4. The fix should involve a more robust way of comparing blocks that ensures the order is consistent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `equals` comparing the blocks by sorting them based on their type name and `mgr_locs` which may not provide a deterministic order. This can lead to inconsistent results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to come up with a more reliable way of comparing the blocks in a deterministic order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by iterating over them in order
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the blocks by iterating over them in a deterministic order, ensuring that each block is compared correctly. This approach removes the reliance on sorting the blocks and guarantees a consistent comparison result.

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
