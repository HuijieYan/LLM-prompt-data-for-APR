## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is called `equals` and it is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to how it compares blocks after consolidating them.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two `DataFrame` instances with different column order and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function erroneously compares the blocks using the `equals` method which is not the appropriate way to compare blocks. The blocks need to be compared based on their contents, not their identities.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their values instead of their identity. We can achieve this by comparing the values within the blocks instead of using the `equals` method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks based on their values
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
                return False

    return True
``` 

By comparing the blocks based on their values using `np.array_equal`, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
