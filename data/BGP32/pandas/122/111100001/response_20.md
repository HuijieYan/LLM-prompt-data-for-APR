### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug in the function lies in the comparison of blocks. It fails to correctly handle cases where the block order is different but the content is the same.
4. The buggy function sorts the blocks by a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`, which may not always be the correct approach for comparison.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides an example where two DataFrames with the same data but different column orders are incorrectly considered as not equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. Due to the sorting based on type name and `mgr_locs`, blocks with the same content but different order are not considered equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on content rather than their order or specific properties. We can compare the content of each block directly to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Now, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function directly compares the content of each block instead of ordering based on specific properties. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
