### Potential error locations:
1. The bug may be in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function could be causing unexpected behavior.

### Explanation of the bug:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function first checks the number of axes of the two instances and then compares each axis using the `equals` method of the respective axes. It then consolidates both instances in place and checks the number of blocks in each instance. Finally, it sorts the blocks of both instances based on a canonical key and compares each block to determine equality.

The bug arises in the block comparison part of the function. Due to the way blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, blocks may not be compared correctly, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly. One approach could be to compare blocks based on their actual values rather than their dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of the corrected version:
In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their actual values using the `tostring()` method. This ensures that blocks are compared based on their content rather than their dtype name and manager locations. The comparison between blocks is then done by iterating over the sorted blocks and checking for equality.
