## Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class checks if two instances of the class are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be in the `equals()` function where it fails to handle cases where the blocks within `self` and `other` instances are in a different order.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` compares two DataFrames with different values in their columns but the buggy `equals()` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing the blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly without relying on the order of blocks within the instances.
5. We can modify the `canonicalize()` function to include additional information to uniquely identify each block, and then use it to compare the blocks in a consistent way.

## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize()` function to include more information about the block, such as the values it contains.
2. Use this modified `canonicalize()` function to compare blocks in a deterministic way, considering the block values.
3. Update the `equals()` function to use the modified `canonicalize()` function for comparing blocks.

## Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist()) # Include values for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After incorporating the changes above, the corrected `equals()` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()`.
