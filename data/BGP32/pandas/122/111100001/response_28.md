### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The `equals` method is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal.
3. The bug in the `equals` method causes it to return `True` incorrectly even when the `BlockManager` instances are not equal. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks and block contents is accurate.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the comparison of blocks uses the type name and values directly, we can fix the bug in the `equals` method and make it return the correct result, passing the failing test.
