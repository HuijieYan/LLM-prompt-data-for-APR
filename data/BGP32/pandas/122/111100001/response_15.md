## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `BlockManager` class and it is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. The function checks the blocks by sorting and comparing them based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the comparison does not take into account the actual block data.
3. The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with different block values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare not just the block metadata (dtype name and mgr_locs) but also the actual block data when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block values along with dtype name and mgr_locs for comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to take into account both metadata and actual block values when comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above corrections, the `equals` function should be able to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case.
