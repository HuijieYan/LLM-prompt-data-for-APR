The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two BlockManager objects in the Pandas library. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared between the two objects. 

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not equal. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.

2. Then, it checks if all axes in both objects are equal. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.

3. After that, it consolidates both `self` and `other` objects in-place.

4. Finally, it compares the blocks within each object. The bug is specifically in this part where it sorts and compares blocks between the two objects. The comparison is being done using the `.equals()` method, which is incorrect for comparing the underlying data in the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the correct approach is to compare the actual data within the blocks by iterating over each block and checking the underlying data. We should compare the values of corresponding blocks from `self` and `other` objects, rather than just comparing the block objects themselves.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data)
        for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

By comparing the block values directly using `np.array_equal()`, we can ensure that the underlying data within the blocks is compared correctly. This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test provided.
