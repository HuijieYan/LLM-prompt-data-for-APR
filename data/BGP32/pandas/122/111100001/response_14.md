### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, which is supposed to check whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their blocks.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, as well as the sorting and comparison of the blocks themselves.
3. The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. If the blocks are not sorted consistently or if there are unconsolidated blocks, the comparison may fail even if the content is the same.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared consistently by sorting them in a reliable way that reflects the content of the blocks accurately.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks.values()
        other_blocks = other.blocks.values()
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks in a sorted order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtypes().to_string(), block.mgr_locs.values.tostring())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on the data types and memory location values, we make sure that the blocks are compared in a consistent way, which should fix the bug.
