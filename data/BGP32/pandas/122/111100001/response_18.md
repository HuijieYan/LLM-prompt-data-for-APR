### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug is likely related to how the `blocks` attribute is being compared between the two instances.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` demonstrates the issue by creating two DataFrames with different column types and asserting that they are not equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method arises from comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on the order of blocks without considering the actual block values. This causes the function to incorrectly determine equality when comparing instances with different column values or types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual block values within each block rather than relying on the order of blocks. This can be done by iterating over the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance and comparing the values of corresponding blocks.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance and comparing their values, we ensure that equality is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their order. This corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test.
