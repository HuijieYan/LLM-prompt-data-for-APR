### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality based on their axes, blocks, and the equality of individual blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks in a sorted order without considering the actual content of the blocks. This could lead to incorrect results when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
In the buggy `equals` method:
- Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type name and `mgr_locs` without considering the content of the blocks can lead to incorrect results.
- The `canonicalize` function is generating a key for sorting the blocks, but it does not involve comparing the actual data in the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` method:
1. Sort the blocks based on a more comprehensive comparison that includes the actual data in the blocks.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks when sorting.
3. Update the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than just the order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class should now properly compare the content of the blocks when checking for equality between two instances. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
