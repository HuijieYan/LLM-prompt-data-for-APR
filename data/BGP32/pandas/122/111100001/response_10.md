### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the shape of the axes, checks if the axes are equal, consolidates the blocks in place, and then compares the blocks.
3. The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks after consolidation not producing the expected result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly after consolidation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks after consolidation. In the current implementation, the blocks are not sorted consistently or correctly before comparison, leading to a false negative result in the equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances before comparing them.
2. Modify the canonicalize function to correctly represent the blocks for comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic to compare the sorted blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_list(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the `equals` function as shown above, it should correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
