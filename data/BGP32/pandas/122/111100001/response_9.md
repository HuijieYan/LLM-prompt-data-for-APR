### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class for equality.
2. The bug lies in the comparison logic of the function, where it compares blocks of data within the instances.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data types for columns and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` function. The bug causes the comparison to incorrectly report that the DataFrames are equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly account for the different data types in the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class when comparing blocks of different data types. The comparison logic does not handle different data types correctly, leading to incorrect equality checks for DataFrames with different data types.

### Fix:
We need to update the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` function to consider the data type of the blocks when sorting and comparing them. By including the data type in the tuple used for sorting, we can ensure that blocks with different data types are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly handle comparisons between instances of the `BlockManager` class, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass.
