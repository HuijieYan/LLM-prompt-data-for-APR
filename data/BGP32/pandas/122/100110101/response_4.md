### Analysis
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to how blocks are canonically sorted before comparison, leading to a false positive result indicating equality when the two dataframes are not equal. The failing test case provides two dataframes with different values in corresponding columns, which should be identified as unequal.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function for sorting blocks does not consider the actual content of the blocks, only their type and locations.
- As a result, when sorting blocks using `canonicalize`, the function may incorrectly identify two dataframes as equal if they have similar types and locations but different values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should incorporate the content of each block for a more thorough comparison. This can be achieved by considering both the type and values within each block when sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Combine type, locations, and content to uniquely identify each block
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the block values in the `canonicalize` function, the sorting mechanism takes into account the content of each block, leading to a more accurate comparison of dataframes.
