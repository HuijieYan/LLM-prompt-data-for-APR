### Identified issues:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the content of the blocks correctly, leading to a false positive result when comparing two `DataFrames`.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on datatype and manager locations. However, this sorting logic is not correctly handling the data structure comparison to determine equality between two `DataFrames`. As a result, the function returns a false positive when comparing two different `DataFrames`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly to determine equality between the two `DataFrames`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the content of the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, we can accurately determine whether two `DataFrames` are equal based on their data. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and correctly handle the comparison between `DataFrames`.
