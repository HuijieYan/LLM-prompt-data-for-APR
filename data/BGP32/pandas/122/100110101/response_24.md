### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the columns of two DataFrames in a specific order that does not match the expected order of comparison. This leads to a mismatch in the comparison because the columns are being compared incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to sort the columns of both DataFrames in a consistent order before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the original order of columns in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: str(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: str(block))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the blocks of the DataFrames are sorted before comparison, resolving the bug that caused the failing test. The blocks are now sorted based on their string representation for consistent comparison order.
