### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The issue arises in the comparison between self_blocks and other_blocks. The bug stems from the sorting process where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting logic is causing the failure when comparing two DataFrames with different values in corresponding columns.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which is not a reliable method for comparing DataFrames. When comparing two DataFrames, the canonicalize function should be modified to consider the actual values within the blocks for a reliable equality check.

### Fix:
Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual values within the blocks for more accurate sorting and equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By revising the `canonicalize` function to include the actual values within the blocks, the comparison and sorting process will be more accurate, resolving the bug.
