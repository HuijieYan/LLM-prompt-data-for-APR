### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents. However, the bug is caused by the comparison logic failing to correctly handle the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values for the columns 'a' and 'b', and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, the buggy `equals` function fails to correctly identify the mismatch in the values of 'a' and 'b' columns between the two DataFrames, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly compare the data within each block of the BlockManager objects. We can achieve this by iterating through the blocks within each BlockManager and comparing them individually.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected function now iterates through each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, comparing them individually using the `equals` method of the blocks. This ensures that the comparison includes the actual data within the blocks, fixing the bug and enabling the function to properly handle the failing test case.
