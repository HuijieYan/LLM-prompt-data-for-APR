### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values. The assertion checks if `df1.equals(df2)` is False, which is expected since the values in the DataFrames are different.

3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, with the output showing that `True is False`.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. It fails to correctly handle the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly compares the axes of both `BlockManager` instances.
2. Verify that the function compares the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance appropriately.

### Updated/corrected function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks, thereby passing the failing test case.
