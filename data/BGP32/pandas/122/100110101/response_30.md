### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is used to compare two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal.
- The buggy function compares the axes of the two BlockManager objects, then consolidates them, sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, and finally compares the blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two different DataFrames with columns `'a'` and `'b'` in different orders and expects the `equals` function to return False.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. It does not handle the case where the DataFrames have the same columns but in different orders, causing the function to incorrectly return True instead of False.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the `equals` function to check for the order of columns in addition to their content. We can achieve this by comparing the columns of both BlockManager objects after sorting them to enforce the same order before comparing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.items))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.items))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on their column names before comparison, ensuring that the order of columns is preserved during comparison. This modification addresses the bug and should now return False as expected in the failing test.
