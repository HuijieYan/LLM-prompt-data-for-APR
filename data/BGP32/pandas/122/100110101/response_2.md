### Analysis:
The `equals` function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug is in the comparison of blocks where the function compares blocks in an incorrect order due to sorting by `canonicalize` function. This leads to a wrong evaluation of equality.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect canonicalization of blocks in the `equals` function. This leads to a wrong order of blocks being compared, resulting in a false assertion of equality.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should not sort the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. Instead, we should directly compare the blocks in the original order they are stored. This will ensure the correct comparison and evaluation of equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test case provided.
