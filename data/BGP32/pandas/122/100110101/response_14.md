### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. 
2. The failing test creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because it evaluated to `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `block` and `oblock` in the list comprehension, where it fails to handle the different values in `df1` and `df2`.

### Bug:
The bug arises in the comparison within the `canonicalize` function. It uses `block.equals(oblock)` to compare blocks, but this comparison doesn't handle the case where the values are different in the blocks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle cases where the block values differ. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
  
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified version compares the block values directly using `block.values.equals(oblock.values)`. This ensures that the comparison is accurate even if the values within the blocks differ.
