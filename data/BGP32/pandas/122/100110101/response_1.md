### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing individual blocks within the objects.
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different column orders.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with `assert True is False`. This means that the `equals` function is not correctly identifying the inequality between the dataframes.
4. The bug is likely in how the function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. It seems to be sorting the blocks based on a canonicalized form, but that might not correctly reflect the data comparison.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting the blocks in a canonicalized way that may not accurately represent the equality comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects. This can cause a dataframe comparison to fail even when the dataframes are different, as seen in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Instead of sorting the blocks in a canonicalized manner, we should compare them directly based on their content. This way, the function will more accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will compare the blocks directly without sorting them in a canonicalized way, ensuring a more accurate equality check for `BlockManager` objects.
