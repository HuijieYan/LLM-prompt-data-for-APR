### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager instances which store the data of two DataFrames. The function first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then compares each block of data within the BlockManagers. The issue seems to arise from the comparison logic within the function.

### Issues:
1. The comparison logic for the blocks using the `equals` method may not be appropriate.
2. The `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks might be causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the function is comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, which might not work as expected for the given data types (integers and strings). This results in the comparison failing even though the DataFrames are different.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the block comparison logic to handle the comparison based on the data stored in the blocks rather than using the `equals` method. Additionally, we might need to adjust the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function depending on the data types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for s_block, o_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if s_block.shape != o_block.shape or s_block.dtypes != o_block.dtypes or not np.allclose(s_block.values, o_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

By adjusting the block comparison to check for shape, dtypes, and values similarity, the corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks of data within the BlockManagers.
