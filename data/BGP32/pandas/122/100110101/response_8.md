### Identified Issue:
The issue in the `equals` function is that it assumes the input dataframes (`self` and `other`) are always structured in the same way. However, the function does not consider cases where the columns in the dataframes are in a different order. The function checks for equality by comparing the columns in the same order, leading to a false negative result even when the dataframes contain the same data but in a different column order.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to account for the potential mismatch in column order between the input dataframes. We can address this by sorting the columns of both dataframes before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the columns of self and other dataframes
    self_columns = sorted(self.axes[0])  
    other_columns = sorted(other.axes[0])

    # Check if the sorted columns match
    if self_columns != other_columns:
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the columns before comparison, we ensure that the order of columns does not affect the equality check between the two dataframes. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
