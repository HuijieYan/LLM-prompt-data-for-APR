### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` (self and other) using their axes and blocks. The function seems to be correctly comparing axes and then sorting and comparing blocks based on dtype and manager locations. The bug might be related to comparing and sorting the blocks incorrectly, leading to the failure of the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Error Cause:
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. These dataframes have the same columns `a` and `b`, but the data in the columns are different in the two dataframes. The buggy function `equals` incorrectly asserts that these two dataframes are equal, resulting in the assertion error.

The error message highlights that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with `assert True is False`. This indicates that the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality check between the blocks in the `equals` function. The comparison should also consider the data contained within the blocks, not just their dtype and manager locations. By ensuring that the content within the blocks is compared correctly, the function should be able to determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances accurately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.index.as_tuple(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.transpose().equals(oblock.transpose())
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values within the blocks and transposing them before the equality check, we can ensure that the function accurately determines whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
