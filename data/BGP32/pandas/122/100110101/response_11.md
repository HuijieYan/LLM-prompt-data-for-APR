### Analysis
1. The provided equals function compares two BlockManager objects (self and other) by comparing their axes and corresponding blocks.
2. The failing test test_dataframe_not_equal creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' in different order and asserts that they are not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion expects the result to be False but it evaluates to True.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the blocks of the two BlockManagers.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the equals method does not correctly handle the comparison of the individual blocks within the BlockManagers. It erroneously assumes that sorting the blocks using a custom key canonicalize and then comparing them with zip should determine equality. However, this strategy is flawed, especially when the two BlockManagers have differently ordered blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on their actual order and content rather than a sorted order. We can iterate over the blocks in order, compare them directly, and return False if any pair of blocks is not equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By directly comparing each block without sorting them, the corrected version ensures that the equals function correctly compares the BlockManagers based on the actual block content and order.
