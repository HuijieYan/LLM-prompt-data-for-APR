The issue in the given `equals` function seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function not being defined and used correctly to sort the blocks. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function `canonicalize` is not defined within the `equals` function, causing an error when the `sorted` function tries to use it.
2. The error message indicates that the `Block` objects do not have an attribute `mgr_locs`. This could be due to incorrect access or a missing attribute assignment.
3. The expected values suggest that the `canonicalize` function should return a tuple with the block's type name and location, which should be used for sorting. However, this logic is missing in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, define the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function and use it to sort the blocks properly based on type and location. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function within the equals function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function and using it correctly to sort the blocks, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values.
