### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`) and their corresponding axes and blocks. However, the bug arises from the incorrect comparison of the block contents. The function fails to account for the different order of columns in the DataFrames being compared, resulting in an incorrect evaluation of equality leading to a failed test.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by data type and manager locations does not consider the columns' order. In the failing test case, the order of columns in `df1` and `df2` is different, leading to a false assertion that the DataFrames are not equal.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the order of columns in the DataFrame. By incorporating the column data in the sorting criteria, we can ensure that the comparison considers the complete block contents including the column order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.items.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the column order in the sorting criteria, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and correctly compare the DataFrames for equality.
