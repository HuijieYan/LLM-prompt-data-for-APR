### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be incorrect.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function might be causing unexpected results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the comparison of two DataFrames in the `equals` function. The test case creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects them to be not equal. However, the buggy `equals` function currently considers the DataFrames equal due to the sorting mechanism based on the data type and memory locations of the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to ensure that the equality comparison in the `equals` function correctly identifies that the DataFrames are not equal when the columns are interchanged.
2. We should review how the blocks of data are being compared and sorted to address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering data and item representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._data, block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the data representation and item names, we ensure that blocks are being sorted correctly for comparison. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and accurately identify that the given DataFrames are not equal.
