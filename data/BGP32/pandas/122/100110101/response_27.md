### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the number of axes in both BlockManager objects is the same. Then, it iterates over the axes and calls the `equals` method for each axis. If the axes match, it moves on to compare the blocks inside the BlockManager objects.

In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with swapped column data types, resulting in `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True`, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the comparison of DataFrame contents when the order of the columns is different. It sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, assuming it will be sufficient for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic of comparing blocks and consider comparing the actual content of the blocks, not just their properties. We should compare the columns/content directly instead of relying only on the dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_ftypes()
    other_blocks = other.get_ftypes()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, we directly compare the blocks in the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their properties. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly compare DataFrames for equality.
