### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue arises when comparing the individual `blocks` within the `BlockManager` instances. The comparison uses a `canonicalize` function to order and compare the blocks based on their type name and location. The bug likely occurs in how the `canonicalize` function operates or how the blocks are sorted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have different values. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, highlighting the incorrect comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly determines the order of the blocks based on type name and location. Additionally, verify that the sorting of blocks using `sorted` is correctly performed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Compare by block type name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The issue is addressed by correctly sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the type name and location information while comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.
