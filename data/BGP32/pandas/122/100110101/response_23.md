### Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects in pandas.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame objects with columns "a" and "b" swapped in the data, which should result in the DataFrames being unequal.
- The failing test provides an error message stating that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.
- The primary issue lies in how the function compares the blocks within `self` and `other`. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function should be done before checking their equality.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the function `equals` is trying to compare the blocks within `self` and `other` after consolidating them in place. This leads to mismatched blocks being considered equal due to the consolidation.
- The error message shows that an assertion meant to evaluate as `False` (`assert True is False`) actually evaluates as `True`, indicating that the function incorrectly considers the DataFrames as equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- The strategy to fix the bug is to sort the blocks based on `canonicalize` function before checking their equality to ensure that the DataFrames are compared correctly.
- By sorting the blocks before comparison, we can ensure that equivalent blocks are correctly matched between the two instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Add sorting of blocks before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should correctly identify the inequality between the provided DataFrames in the failing test.
