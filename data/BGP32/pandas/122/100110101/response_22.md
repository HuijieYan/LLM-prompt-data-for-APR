### Analysis:
The `equals` function compares two BlockManager objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. It then attempts to sort the blocks based on their type name and location to ensure a consistent comparison. The error occurs when comparing data frames `df1` and `df2` as the function does not handle data frames with different data types in columns correctly.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the function's assumption that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are comparable without taking into account the data type of columns in a data frame. In the failing test case, the columns "a" and "b" have different data types in `df1` and `df2`, leading to an assertion error.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type when sorting the blocks. By incorporating the data type into the sorting key, we can ensure that columns with different data types are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including data type in sorting key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )    
``` 

After implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly handle data frames with columns of different data types, passing the failing test case provided.
