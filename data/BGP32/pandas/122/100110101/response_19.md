### Analysis
The `equals` function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The function first compares the axes of the two instances and then proceeds to compare the blocks. The bug seems to arise from the comparison of blocks where it sorts the blocks based on a custom function `canonicalize`, but the function is not correctly handling the blocks with dtype 'object' in this case.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not handle 'object' dtype blocks properly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results during block comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle 'object' dtype blocks correctly. We should modify the sorting key to account for the dtype of the blocks to ensure a proper comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.dtype.name == 'object':
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to handle 'object' dtype blocks properly by converting them to tuples, we ensure that the blocks are correctly compared and sorted without causing the bug. This correction should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
