### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different column values, expecting them not to be equal.
3. The error message states that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, indicating that the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. The bug likely stems from the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances since the axes comparison is not failing. The bug could be related to how blocks are handled during comparison.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how blocks are compared in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The logic for comparing block equality might not be implemented correctly, leading to the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function is correct and properly accounts for differences between the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if self_blocks != other_blocks:
        return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` rather than sorting them by type and location, we can ensure that the comparison is based on the actual blocks, leading to a correct comparison result and satisfying the failing test case.
