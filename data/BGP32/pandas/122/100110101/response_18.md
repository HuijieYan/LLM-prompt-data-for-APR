### Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManager instances for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of both instances first, then checks the blocks of each instance for equality.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks due to a sorting issue.
4. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`.
5. The expected values show the correct input and output values for the failing test case.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely stems from how the blocks are sorted for comparison. Since the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, it can result in a different order even when the content is the same. This can lead to a false assertion of inequality.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks directly for sorting, rather than relying on dtype name or `mgr_locs`. This ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content, leading to accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on their content directly by converting them into bytes for comparison. This ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content, leading to accurate equality comparison.
