### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two instances are equal. The error occurs because in the test case, two DataFrames with different values are being compared, leading to a situation where the `equals` method should return `False` but it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is comparing the values of the data blocks in a simplistic way. It does not properly compare the values within the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are compared. We should compare the values inside each block rather than just checking if the blocks are equal. We can achieve this by comparing each element within the blocks iteratively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare blocks content-wise
    def content_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    return all(content_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the values inside the blocks using `block.values.equals()`, we ensure that the content of the blocks is compared accurately. This will resolve the issue where the function erroneously returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with different values.
