### Analysis
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function first checks if the axes of both instances have the same length. Then, it iterates over the axes and calls the `equals` method of each axis to compare them. After that, it consolidates both instances inplace and compares the blocks inside them.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails as `assert True is False`. This suggests that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Bug
The bug occurs due to the wrong comparison logic in the return statement. The function should return `False` if any of the blocks inside `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are not equal. However, the current implementation always returns `True`, leading to the failed test.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to correctly compare each block inside `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. If any pair is not equal, the function should return `False`. If all pairs are equal, the function should return `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and all other expected cases.
