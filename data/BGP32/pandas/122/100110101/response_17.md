### Analysis
The `equals` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are the same. Then, it consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager` object and compares the blocks themselves. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, where the sorting logic might be incorrect or cause mismatched blocks to be compared.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the `assert` statement in the test to fail. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect. This discrepancy arises from how the `equals` method is implemented within the buggy function. In this case, the bug seems to be related to how the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared correctly. One possible strategy is to sort the blocks based on a more general and consistent key that takes into account all necessary attributes for comparison. Additionally, we should identify the exact attributes that need to be considered for sorting and ensure that the comparison logic aligns with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining block data and type information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), type(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a combination of block values and type information, the corrected code should address the bug and ensure the comparisons are done correctly.
