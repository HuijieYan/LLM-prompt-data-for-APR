### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates them, compares the number of blocks, and finally compares each block iteratively.
2. The issue arises because the function does not account for the possibility of blocks being identical but having different locations, causing it to incorrectly return `True`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and asserts that they are not equal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns `True`. This happens due to the mismatch in the blocks' order.
4. To fix this bug, we should sort the blocks based on a canonical identifier that includes the data type and locations to ensure consistent comparison.

### Correction:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by sorting the blocks in a consistent order based on their data type and locations during comparison, ensuring that the blocks are correctly matched.

By applying this fix, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
