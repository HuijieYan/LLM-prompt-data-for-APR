### Bug analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with swapped values within columns 'a' and 'b', expecting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the test assertion failed because `True` is returned instead of `False`. This indicates that the function is incorrectly identifying the two DataFrames as equal.
4. The runtime values and types of variables inside the function show that the comparison is done using the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. There is a sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` returns `True` instead of `False` for cases with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. The issue arises when comparing blocks with the same data but different locations. To resolve this, consider sorting the blocks based on their content rather than their memory locations.
2. Instead of comparing `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, use the block's actual data values for comparison.
3. Sort the blocks based on their content before comparing them in the `equals` function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using the block's actual values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.get_values()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully by returning `False`.
