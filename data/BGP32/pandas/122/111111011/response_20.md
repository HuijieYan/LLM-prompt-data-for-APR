### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns in a different order to intentionally test if the `equals` function handles such case correctly.
3. The error message points out that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The runtime input/output values show that the function properly compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances but fails to properly compare the blocks which lead to the incorrect equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. We will ensure that the blocks are compared in a way that considers the actual values in them and not just the internal representation.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks_values()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks_values()

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
def get_blocks_values(self):
    block_values = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        block_values.append(block.values)
    return block_values
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function gets the actual values of the blocks before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is based on the real block data.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass, addressing the GitHub issue related to DataFrame equality comparison with differently ordered columns.
