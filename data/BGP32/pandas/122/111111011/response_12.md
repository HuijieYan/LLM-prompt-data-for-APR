The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True is False`. The issue is related to comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have the same data but different column orientations.

### Error Analysis:
1. The function compares the axes of two BlockManager objects, then it sorts and compares the blocks contained within them.
   
2. Despite the data within the DataFrames being different, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
   
3. The sorting of blocks based on the dtype name and locs of the blocks might result in identical blocks being compared incorrectly due to different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between two BlockManager objects considers the data differently sorted within the blocks while maintaining the relative order of the columns.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {tuple(block_values) for block_values in self.blocks.values()}
    other_blocks = {tuple(block_values) for block_values in other.blocks.values()}

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function takes the values of the blocks stored in the BlockManager objects and compares the two sets of block values to determine if they are equal.

By using sets to compare the block values, we address the issue of identical blocks being compared incorrectly due to different locations, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
