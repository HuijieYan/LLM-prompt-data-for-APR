The bug in the provided function is related to comparing two BlockManager objects using the `equals` method. The bug arises because the comparison is incorrectly considering the block order and locations, leading to an incorrect True result when the two dataframes are actually different.

### Error Analysis:
1. The bug occurs because the `equals` method compares the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function. However, the block order should not be considered for equality comparison, leading to incorrect results.
2. The bug is triggered by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` where two dataframes with the same columns but different data are incorrectly deemed equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method such that it only compares the blocks for equality without considering the block order or locations. This change should ensure that dataframes with the same content but different block orders are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now directly compare the blocks for equality without considering their order or locations. This change should ensure that the function correctly identifies the difference between two dataframes based on their actual content.
