The bug in the `equals()` function is due to the comparison of blocks based on their order rather than their content. The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order. We can achieve this by first sorting the blocks based on their content and then comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_loc

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version first sorts the blocks based on their content represented by `mgr_locs` attribute before comparing them. This ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their order, fixing the bug that caused the function to return `True` incorrectly.

After applying this fix, the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case should pass successfully.
