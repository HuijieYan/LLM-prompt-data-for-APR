### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
- The error message suggests that the comparison is incorrectly evaluating to `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- The issue on GitHub confirms that the function is not returning the correct result for the provided testcase.
- The function compares the axes of the two instances, then calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both instances, and finally compares the blocks within the instances.
- The bug might be related to processing and comparing the internal blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `equals` function is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, but it may not be handling the comparison accurately due to potentially different internal block locations.
- The bug causes the comparison to wrongly return `True` even though the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To address the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are compared correctly regardless of their internal locations.
- We can potentially modify the comparison logic in a way that considers the block content without being affected by their specific locations.
- Sorting the blocks before comparison based on some unique identifier might help in achieving a consistent comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on a unique identifier for consistent comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this corrected version should address the issue and the failing test case.
