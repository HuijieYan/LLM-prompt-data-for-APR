### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check equality between two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different data, intending to assert that they are not equal. However, the test fails, indicating that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. The error message shows that the comparison inside the `equals` method is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False`, leading to the test failure.
4. The runtime values and types provided indicate that the comparison between blocks within the `equals` function is not yielding the expected result due to the comparison of blocks with different locations.
5. The GitHub issue describes this bug, stating that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. The comparison does not account for different block locations, leading to wrong results. The sorting based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array` is inadequate for distinguishing between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue:
1. Update the `equals` method to consider block location information to ensure correct comparison.
2. Utilize a more precise criterion for sorting and comparison of blocks to prevent the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method incorporating a modified approach to consider block locations:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations and make the sorting more precise, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now return the correct comparison result. This fix should resolve the bug and align with the expectations from the failing test and the GitHub issue.
