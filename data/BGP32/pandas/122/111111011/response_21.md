### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks is done in an incorrect order. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison, but the sorting is incorrect.
3. The incorrect sorting causes blocks with the same content but different locations to be considered unequal, leading to the method returning `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparison.
2. We need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Ensure blocks are of equal length
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will address the bug by comparing the blocks based on their content, ensuring that blocks with the same content are considered equal regardless of their locations.
