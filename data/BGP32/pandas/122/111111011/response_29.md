### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs because the comparison logic does not consider the order of blocks within the `blocks` attribute, leading to incorrect equality evaluation even when the blocks are the same but in different locations.

The current implementation sorts the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance by `canonicalize` function before comparing. The `canonicalize` function generates a key based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which represents the block's location. However, since `mgr_locs` is an object of type `BlockPlacement` and is not directly comparable, the comparison logic fails to correctly evaluate the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to redefine how the blocks are compared when determining the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. Instead of relying solely on `mgr_locs` for block order, we should consider the contents of the blocks for comparison. We can modify the `equals` function to directly compare the content of each block within the `BlockManager` instances without relying on the block order.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks' content without relying on the block order, this corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
