## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The `equals` method is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks.
3. Based on the runtime values provided, it seems that the comparison logic for the blocks might be failing to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' in different orders and asserts that they are not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` method, these DataFrames are incorrectly evaluated as equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to handle cases where identical blocks may exist at different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `equals` method to handle cases where blocks are technically the same but may have different locations.
2. Instead of directly comparing blocks, compare the block content in a way that considers these potential differences in block locations.
3. Pay attention to how the blocks are sorted and compared to ensure accurate evaluation of equality.
4. Make sure to reflect these changes in the return statement of the method to correctly determine the equality of the `BlockManager` instances.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, ensuring correct comparison
     def canonicalize(block):
         return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the bug-fixed version:
- We use a `canonicalize` function to generate a key for each block based on its content and location.
- We sort the blocks based on this key to ensure a consistent order for comparison.
- We compare the blocks in a way that also considers the block locations.

This should address the issue and correctly handle cases where blocks may have the same content but different locations, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
