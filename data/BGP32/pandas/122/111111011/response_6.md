### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, the function returns `False`, and then it checks the equality of each block between the two instances.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True`.

3. In the failing test, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have the same column names but different order of columns and types. This difference in column order and types causes the `equals` function to fail in correctly identifying them as unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class does not consider the order of columns or their data type while comparing the blocks of two instances. This leads to wrong comparison results being returned, causing the failing test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should also compare the column names and types along with the block content for equality. This can help ensure that even if the order of columns is different between two instances, they can still be correctly identified as unequal if the column names or types are not the same.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the column names and types during the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function, the corrected version should now be able to correctly identify DataFrames as unequal even if the column order or types are different. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
