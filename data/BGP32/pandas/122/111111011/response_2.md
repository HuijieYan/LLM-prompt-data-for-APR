### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and other attributes. However, the comparison is incorrect due to how the blocks are being sorted for comparison. The bug causes the function to wrongly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Issue in the Buggy Function:
The issue lies in the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function that combines the block type name and `mgr_locs`. When blocks have identical content but different locations, they are wrongly identified as equal due to this sorting mechanism.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than treating them as equal based on their type and location. We should modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to accurately compare the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly
    for s_block, o_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False

    return True
```

### After the Fix:
Applying this fix will ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the reported GitHub issue should be resolved.
