### Bug Analysis
- The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if they have the same axes and blocks.
- The bug arises when comparing blocks. The comparison of blocks is done based on their type and location, assuming that blocks with the same data but in different locations are not equal, which is incorrect.
- The bug leads to the `equals` method returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to modify the way blocks are compared:
1. Compare the blocks based on their content, disregarding their physical location in memory.
2. To compare blocks by content, we will compare the actual data inside the blocks rather than comparing by type and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_block_content(block, oblock):
        arr1 = block.values
        arr2 = oblock.values
        return np.array_equal(arr1, arr2)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    
    return all(
        compare_block_content(block, oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made
1. Replaced the block comparison logic to compare the actual values within the blocks using `np.array_equal`.
2. Changed the sorting key for blocks to consider the block values and positions.

By making these changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their types and locations. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
