### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises due to the comparison logic that is used to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. When comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, the comparison does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

The bug can be described as follows:
1. The function first compares the number of axes (dimensions) in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances. If they differ, the function returns `False`.
2. Next, it checks if each axis in `self` is equal to the corresponding axis in `other` using the `equals` method. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates the blocks within `self` and `other` instances inplace.
4. It then compares the number of blocks in `self` and `other`. If they are not the same, it returns `False`.
5. The function then sorts the blocks based on a canonical order for comparison. However, the comparison only considers the dtype name and mgr_locs, which might lead to incorrect results if the block content is different but the dtype and mgr_locs are the same.

The comparison logic in the final step is flawed because it should compare the actual content of the blocks rather than just the dtype and mgr_locs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to update the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the block values directly, ensuring that the blocks are equal in terms of both metadata (dtype, mgr_locs) and actual content.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)  # sort blocks based on values for proper comparison
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their values before comparing them, which ensures that the comparison considers both the metadata and the actual content of the blocks.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
