### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different data types and expects the `equals` method to return `False` because the columns are in different orders.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that it incorrectly evaluated to `True`.
4. The runtime values show that the comparison is failing because the `equals` method does not handle the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations correctly. The comparison is sensitive to the order of the blocks.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True`. This confirms the bug's existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the comparison in the `equals` function does not handle the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations. The sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function causes the comparison to be order-sensitive, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks irrespective of their order but considering the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def are_blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        any(are_blocks_equal(block1, block2) for block2 in other_blocks)
        for block1 in self_blocks
    )
```

### After the fix:
The corrected `equals` function will properly compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances regardless of their order, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub. Now, when the function is executed with the failing test, it should return `False` as expected, resolving the bug.
