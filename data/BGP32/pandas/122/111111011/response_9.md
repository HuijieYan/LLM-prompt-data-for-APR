### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` which creates two dataframes with columns in different orders and expects them to not be equal.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the function `equals` relies on the order of blocks stored within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the equality check is influenced by the order of blocks which may differ even if the actual data is the same.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than their order within the `blocks` tuple.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks are equal regardless of their order
    def block_equals(b1, b2):
        return b1.equals(b2)

    # Compare blocks in a more robust way considering their actual content
    self_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in other.blocks}

    if set(self_blocks_dict.keys()) != set(other_blocks_dict.keys()):
        return False

    return all(
        block_equals(self_blocks_dict[key], other_blocks_dict[key])
        for key in self_blocks_dict.keys()
    )
```

### Updated Analysis:
- With the corrected implementation, the `equals` function now compares blocks based on their content rather than their order, ensuring a more accurate equality check.
- The fixed version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
