### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the comparison logic implemented in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two `BlockManager` objects, the function fails to correctly identify equality when the blocks have the same content but are located in different positions.

The function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and the manager locations. However, it fails to consider the location of the blocks in the sorting process. As a result, even if the blocks in `self` and `other` are identical, but located differently, the function incorrectly determines that they are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks takes into account their content and location. One way to achieve this is to enhance the `canonicalize` function to include the blocks' content and location when sorting them. This way, blocks with the same data type, content, and location will be considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Enhance the canonicalize function to include location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the manager locations of the blocks, we can ensure that the comparison considers both the content and the position of the blocks. This correction should address the bug and allow the `equals` function to correctly identify equality between `BlockManager` objects.
