### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It first checks if the axes are the same, then consolidates the internal data structures, and finally compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks.
   
2. **Error Cause**: The error suggests that the comparison of blocks is failing even when the blocks contain the same data due to the different locations. This is leading to `True` being returned when the expected result is `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their locations when checking for equality. Sorting the blocks should be done based on content rather than their current location.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content rather than location
    def content_sort(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.ndim)  # Sort based on values and dimension
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=content_sort)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=content_sort)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content (values and dimension), we ensure that the comparison between corresponding blocks considers the actual data within them, resolving the issue where blocks with the same content but different locations were falsely identified as unequal.
