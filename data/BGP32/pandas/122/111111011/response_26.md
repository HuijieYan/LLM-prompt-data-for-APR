### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axes lengths between `self` and `other` can lead to a false return value.
2. Sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations might cause a mismatch in block order.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not handle the order of blocks properly when comparing two BlockManagers. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, which can result in incorrect comparisons, especially when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic between the blocks in a way that accounts for identical blocks in different locations. One possible approach is to compare the blocks based on content rather than sorting them. Additionally, we should consider the order of block comparisons to avoid mismatches.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the block contents instead of relying on sorted order based on dtype name and manager locations, we can ensure that the `equals` function handles identical blocks in different locations correctly. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
