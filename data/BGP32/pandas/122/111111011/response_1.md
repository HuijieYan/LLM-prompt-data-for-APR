### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. If two identical blocks have different locations, they will not be sorted correctly, causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly. This behavior fails the test case where two DataFrames with the same data but different column order result in `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block's type when sorting the blocks. This change will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are handled correctly, and the `equals` function will return the expected result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using the data type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the blocks are sorted based only on the data type name and not the `mgr_locs`, resolving the bug where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly resulted in a `True` comparison.
