### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and blocks' content are equal. If any of these conditions fail, it returns False.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types than each other.
3. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, it should return False due to the mismatch in data types in the columns.
4. The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where blocks are identical but located differently.
5. The current implementation sorts the blocks using a canonicalization function, which disregards the scenario where blocks with different locations can be equal. This leads to a wrong comparison result.
6. The failing test, runtime input values, and the GitHub issue highlight the incorrect behavior of the `equals()` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals()` method to account for blocks with the same content but different locations. Specifically, we should compare the actual content of the blocks rather than sorting them based on canonicalization. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate even if the blocks are located differently.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_content = [(block.values, block.items) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_content = [(block.values, block.items) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        self_block_content == other_block_content
    )
```

By directly comparing the content of the blocks in the `equals()` method, we ensure that two `BlockManager` objects are equal if their block contents match, irrespective of their locations within the objects. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
