### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks. The issue arises because even if the blocks are the same, if they are not in the same order, the function still returns `True`, leading to incorrect behavior.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is specifically designed to identify this issue by creating two `DataFrame` objects with the same data but in different order for columns `a` and `b`. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, highlighting the bug in the `equals()` function.

3. The error message shows that the comparison within the `equals()` function is returning `True is False`, indicating that the function is incorrectly evaluating the equality condition. This is caused by how the blocks are compared without considering their order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals()` function should ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparison based on their content to achieve a meaningful check for equality. This ensures that even if the blocks are in a different order, as long as the content is the same, the function will correctly return `False` in case of inequality.

### Bug-Fixed Version
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort the blocks for comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content before comparison, the function will now correctly identify inequality even if the blocks are not in the same order, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub report.
