### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality based on their blocks. However, the bug causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks in the instances have identical data but are placed in different locations.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on the block's dtype and its `mgr_locs`. Since the comparison is based on this sorting, blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal, leading to the incorrect result.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are sorted before comparison in the `equals` function. Instead of relying solely on the `canonicalize` function, we should compare the actual block content for equality. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we remove the `canonicalize` function and directly compare the blocks for equality. This change ensures that identical blocks at different locations are correctly identified as not equal, addressing the issue observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.
