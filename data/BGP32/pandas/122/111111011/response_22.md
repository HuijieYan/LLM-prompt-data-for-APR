### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It first checks if the axes are of the same length, then compares each axis element using the `.equals()` method. After that, it consolidates both objects in place and sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs converted to a list.
   
2. The bug in the function arises from incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` instances of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison should not be based on the locations of the blocks but rather on the values contained in the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare blocks is not considering the actual data within the blocks; it only considers the dtype name and mgr_locs (block locations). Due to this, identical blocks with different locations are considered different, leading to a false comparison result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data within the blocks for comparison. This can involve converting the block data into a common comparable format for sorting, ensuring that the comparison is based on block values rather than their locations or data types.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this fix should resolve the issue where the initial test function fails in comparing two DataFrame instances, ensuring that the `equals` function compares the actual block data rather than just their dtype names and locations.
