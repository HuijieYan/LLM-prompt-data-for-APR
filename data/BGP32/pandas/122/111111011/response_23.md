### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class fails when comparing two block managers due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks' order. The function sorts the blocks based on the block's data type name, `dtype.name`, and the block's locations, `mgr_locs`. However, when the blocks are sorted based on these two criteria, and the comparison is made, it results in incorrect output for identical blocks with different locations, causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing sorted blocks directly, we should iterate over the blocks and compare each pair individually. This ensures that we compare corresponding blocks correctly without being affected by their input locations. We can remove the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` before comparison, as they lead to the incorrect output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing corresponding blocks without sorting them based on their locations, the corrected function should now return the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
