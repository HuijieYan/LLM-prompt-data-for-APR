### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class, which is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types and values and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method.
3. The failing test asserts for `df1.equals(df2) is False`, but due to a bug in the `equals` method, it returns `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not compare the blocks in a consistent order, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
5. The failing test provides input values for two BlockManager instances `self` and `other`, their axes, and blocks. At the return point of the function, it captures the values and types of relevant variables, which highlights the issue with sorting blocks using the canonicalize function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug fix involves ensuring that the blocks are consistently ordered before comparison.
2. One approach is to modify the `get_mgr_locs` function in the `Block` class to return a tuple with dtype name and mgr_locs values, which can be used for sorting.
3. Another approach is to sort the blocks directly based on block values before comparing in the `equals` method.
4. Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types appropriately to ensure consistent ordering of blocks.
5. Update the `equals` method to utilize the modified sorting logic for self and other blocks comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks consistently based on values for comparison
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x.mgr_locs.to_dict(), x._block_datavalue))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks consistently based on their values before comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue highlighted in the failing test.
