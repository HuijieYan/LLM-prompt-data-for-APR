### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue arises due to sorting the blocks inside the function without considering the different locations of identical blocks. This results in returning `True` even when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Error Cause:
The `equals` function fails to consider the block locations when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The sorted blocks comparison does not account for the equal content present but at different locations, leading to a false positive equality result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
1. Ensure that the comparison between blocks takes into account not just content but also block locations.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in addition to block type.
3. Update the block sorting logic to consider the block type and locations for proper comparison.

### Bug-fixed Version:
Here is the bug-fixed version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_frame().itertuples(index=False)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this bug-fixed implementation, the `equals` function will properly consider the block locations along with block types when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, resolving the issue of the incorrect equality result in the failing test.
