### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks in two instances by sorting them based on their dtype name and manager locations. This sorting can lead to misinterpretation of the equality of blocks, especially if the blocks are ordered differently but contain the same data.
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing because the buggy `equals` function returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not properly handle situations where blocks are the same but in different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks for multiple blocks.

### Proposed Fix:
To address this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to compare blocks based on the content rather than their sorting order. We can achieve this by comparing block contents directly rather than sorting and comparing block order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on content
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks' content rather than sorting them, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies the equality of DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.

After applying this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
