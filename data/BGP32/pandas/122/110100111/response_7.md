**Analysis:**

1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes in both `BlockManager` objects is the same. If not, it returns `False`.
3. Next, it checks if all axes in both objects are equal using a generator expression. If not, it returns `False`.
4. It then consolidates the data inplace for both objects.
5. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in both objects. If different, it returns `False`.
6. The function then sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` values.
7. Finally, it iterates through sorted blocks and checks if each block is equal in both objects.

**Identified Error:**

The function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` values. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object is used incorrectly resulting in the bug.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object is being used as a function (`as_array.tolist()`) which does not exist. This leads to an AttributeError and causes the function to return unexpectedly.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object.
2. Ensure that the function correctly extracts the relevant information for sorting the blocks.
3. Validate that the sorting based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` values is accurate for comparison.
4. Test the corrected function with the failing test case to verify that it now returns the expected output.

**Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:**
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the `equals` function and pass the failing test case mentioned.
