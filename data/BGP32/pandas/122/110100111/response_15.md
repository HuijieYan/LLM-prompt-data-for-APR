### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. 
2. The function first compares the number of axes between the two instances, then iterates over the axes to check for equality. After that, it consolidates the block managers in place and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it tries to canonicalize the blocks and compare them for equality.
3. The bug in the function causes it to return `True` incorrectly even when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal. This issue has been reported in a GitHub issue with detailed steps to reproduce and versions of the libraries being used.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks after consolidation.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect implementation of canonicalizing block order, causing blocks with identical values but different locations (mgr_locs) to be incorrectly identified as equal. This leads to the function returning `True` even when the blocks are actually different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider the mgr_locs while ensuring identical blocks at different locations are not mistakenly identified as equal.
2. Modify the comparison logic in the function to ensure it correctly identifies the equality of blocks based on both dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order considering mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result as expected.
