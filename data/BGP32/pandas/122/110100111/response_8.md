### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class checks for equality between two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first compares the length of the axes, then iterates over each pair of axes and checks for equality. Next, it consolidates both instances and compares the length of their blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks based on their dtype names and locations.
3. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks since the bug does not consider the scenario where identical blocks might have different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for blocks to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from an incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. When sorting the blocks based on dtype names and locations, the comparison code fails to consider cases where identical blocks have different locations. This results in inaccurate equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider block content along with dtype name and locations during sorting. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not erroneously considered as unequal.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block content, type name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to also include the block values in the comparison, the corrected function will accurately compare blocks even if they have the same content but different locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
