### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two sets of blocks within the `self` and `other` instances. If any of the axes or blocks do not match, the function returns `False`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function `equals` returns `True` when it is supposed to return `False` in cases where identical blocks have different locations.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared for equality in the `equals` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely occurs due to the comparison of blocks within the `self` and `other` instances. The sorting based on the `canonicalize` function might not be correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations as different. This leads to an incorrect `True` return when the function should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, an alternative method of comparison can be used to accurately compare the blocks within the `self` and `other` instances. Possibly incorporating a comparison based on both block type and the actual values within the blocks can help identify when blocks with different locations are indeed different.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes sorting the blocks based on block type and location before comparing them for equality. This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly identified as different, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
