### Analysis
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The bug is likely in the comparison logic or the order of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.
- The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` but swaps the data around. The test expects the DataFrames to be unequal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns True.
- The expected behavior is that the function should return False when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause
- The bug arises from the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks in the `equals` function.
- If two blocks have the same data but are located in different positions, the equality check fails due to sorting based on the block's type and `mgr_locs`.
- The expected behavior should focus on the data content within the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Instead of sorting blocks based on dtype name and locations, focus on comparing the actual data in the blocks.
- Update the `canonicalize` function to compare the data values within the blocks directly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation
- The updated `equals` function now directly compares the block data for equality without sorting based on type and locations.
- This modification ensures that the function focuses on the meaningful content of the blocks rather than their positions or types.
