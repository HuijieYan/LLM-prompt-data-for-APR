### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking equality of two instances.
2. The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations.
3. The bug results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. We need to fix the comparison logic to properly identify differences in block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations when determining the canonical form of a block.
2. Adjust the comparison of blocks to also include checking block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updates the canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort blocks based on the updated canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality of sorted blocks including locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations and adjusting the comparison logic, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue.
