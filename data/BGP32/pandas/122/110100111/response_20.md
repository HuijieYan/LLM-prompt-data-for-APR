### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks if the lengths of the axes are the same between the two instances. If not, it returns False. Then it compares each axis element using `equals()` method which is expected to compare them for equality.
3. The bug seems to be occurring when comparing the blocks. The comparison logic involves sorting the blocks based on block type name and manager locations, then checking if each block equals its counterpart in the other object.
4. The bug might be related to the inconsistency in the checks for equality of block elements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when comparing two `BlockManager` objects using the `equals()` method. The faulty logic in the `canonicalize()` function, used for sorting the blocks, is causing identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the `canonicalize()` function to consider block locations and data types more accurately for comparing the blocks. Additionally, we need to modify the block checking logic to properly handle blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on data type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.flatten()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function should now properly handle the comparison of `BlockManager` objects, addressing the issue that caused identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly evaluated as equal.
