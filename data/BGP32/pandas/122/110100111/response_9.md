### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the `axes` and `blocks` of two instances (`self` and `other`) to determine if they are equal.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the instances. It appears the comparison may fail if the blocks are identical but located in different positions.
3. The failing test case expects the `equals` method to return `False` for two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with columns swapped.
4. To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks independently of their positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when comparing the blocks using the `equals` function. If the blocks are identical but located in different positions, the comparison will fail and incorrectly return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of considering their positions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.get_values_hash() for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.get_values_hash() for block in other.blocks}
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In the corrected version, we compare the hashes of the block values, which ensures content equality rather than positional equality of the blocks.
