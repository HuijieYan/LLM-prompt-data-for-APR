### Analyzing the buggy function

The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. However, there seems to be a bug causing it to return incorrect results, as illustrated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Error location and cause of the bug

1. The bug might lie in the comparison logic for axes. 
2. The bug may relate to the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. 

The comparison logic used to compare axes and blocks might not be properly implemented, leading to incorrect comparisons and ultimately incorrect equality checks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return False since the data in both dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not the same. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it is likely returning True incorrectly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To address the bug:
1. Revise the comparison logic for the `equals` function to ensure it correctly compares axes and blocks.
2. Consider reviewing the sorting mechanisms for blocks to ensure consistency before comparison.

### Bugs fixed in the redefined code

1. Adjusted the comparison logic for axes and blocks to ensure correct comparisons.
2. Ensured that blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are consistently sorted before being compared.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by their types for comparison
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

By fixing the comparison logic and ensuring consistent block sorting before comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly handle comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances.
