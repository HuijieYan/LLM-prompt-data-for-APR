**Analysis:**

1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
   
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two objects are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
   
3. It then iterates over each axis and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method of the axes.
   
4. Next, it consolidates inplace the blocks for both objects.
   
5. After consolidating, it compares the number of blocks in both objects. If they are different, it returns `False`.
   
6. It then sorts the blocks in each object based on a canonicalization function to ensure that the blocks are ordered consistently before comparing each block for equality.

**Bug Explanation:**

The bug occurs when comparing different blocks with the same content but different memory locations. In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks but with different column orders. The function incorrectly returns `True` because it only compares the content of the blocks but not their memory locations.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the memory location of the blocks. By comparing both the block content and the memory location, we can ensure that identical blocks at different memory locations are not considered equal.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that identical blocks with different memory locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
