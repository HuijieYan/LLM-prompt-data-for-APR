### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating blocks, sorting and canonicalizing the blocks, and then comparing each block.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function assumes that blocks need to be sorted and canonicalized before comparing, which might lead to incorrect results.
2. There is a discrepancy in the expected values of `df1` and `df2` in the failing test function, indicating a problem in the order or type of data stored in the `BlockManager` object.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. It tries to sort and canonicalize blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before comparing them. However, in some cases like the failing test, identical blocks with different locations might still be equal but appear as unequal due to this sorting.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the sorting and canonicalization of blocks before comparison. Instead, we can directly compare the blocks without altering their order. This will ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their internal metadata.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting and canonicalizing them, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
