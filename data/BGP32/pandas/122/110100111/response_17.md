### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function compares the axes first and then tries to consolidate each instance before comparing the blocks. It then sorts and compares the blocks based on their type names and manager locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects the equality check to return `False`, but the current implementation returns `True`.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are compared after consolidation and sorting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks after attempting to consolidate and sort them. When the consolidation changes the order of blocks or the actual data contained within them, the comparison fails even when the blocks are logically equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks without attempting to consolidate or change their order. Since the logical equality of blocks is what's important, the comparison should be done without any pre-processing of the blocks.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated function skips the consolidation steps and directly compares the blocks without altering their order. It should now correctly handle the comparison logic and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
