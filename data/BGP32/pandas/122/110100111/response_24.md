### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the class `BlockManager` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with columns in different positions and expects them to not be equal.
- The failing test implies that the `equals` function currently incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different positions.

### Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length could lead to early return if lengths are not equal.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function which uses `dtype.name` of a block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the code causes the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different positions. This is because the function canonizes the order of the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which could lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on their order, we may need to compare them directly for equality. Sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs may lead to incorrect results.
2. Avoid early return based solely on the lengths of axes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By simplifying the comparison logic to directly compare each block between the two `BlockManager` instances without sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, this corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test case.
