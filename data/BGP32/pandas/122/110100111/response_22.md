### Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects. 
2. The function checks if the axes of the two objects are equal and if the blocks within them are equal. 
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, which involves consolidation and sorting of blocks based on their type and location.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two `DataFrame` objects that have columns with different types. The current function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is comparing blocks in a way that does not handle cases where the blocks have different types in the same location, leading to an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve the block comparison logic to properly handle cases where blocks have different types. We can modify the canonicalization step to differentiate blocks based on both type name and locations to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks will properly handle cases where blocks have different types in the same location, resolving the incorrect comparison issue.
