### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order, returning False if any discrepancies are found.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' but with different data types in each column. It then asserts that calling `equals` on these DataFrames should return False.
3. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. If the blocks have the same content but different locations, the `equals` function incorrectly returns True.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the contents of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, considering the block locations.
2. To achieve this, sort the blocks based on their content and location before comparing them, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are still considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.ftype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison should correctly handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are present in the `BlockManager` objects.
