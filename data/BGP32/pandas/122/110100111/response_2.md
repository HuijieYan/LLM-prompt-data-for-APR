### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks if the axes are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks within each axis.
3. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which could lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. If the blocks have identical content but different locations, the comparison will falsely return False.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison between blocks to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are recognized as equal. We can modify the `canonicalize` function and adjust the comparison logic between blocks accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then the content of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the content of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with identical content are considered equal, regardless of their locations. This modification will fix the bug and make the `equals` function correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances.
