### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return True even when the blocks have different locations but contain the same data.
3. The bug is identified in the logic that sorts and compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the criteria for block equality to consider both the type name and `mgr_locs` of the block.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the flawed logic in the `equals()` function, where it compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Due to the block ordering mechanism using `canonicalize`, blocks that have the same data but different locations are treated as unequal.
3. This behavior contradicts the expected outcome where the data content matters more than the block locations for equality.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the `mgr_locs` attribute along with the block's dtype name.
2. Update the block comparison logic to consider both the dtype name and `mgr_locs` for determining block equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include mgr_locs in canonicalization
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        # Consider both dtype and mgr_locs for block equality
        block.dtype == oblock.dtype and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing the suggested changes in the `equals()` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should return the correct equality comparison result for the `BlockManager` instances.
