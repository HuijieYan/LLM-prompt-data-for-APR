### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function checks if the axes of two `BlockManager` objects are equal and then proceeds to compare their blocks.
3. The bug occurs when comparing blocks due to mismatched locations within the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights this bug by showcasing a scenario where the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for non-equal `DataFrame`s.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly comparing blocks. The issue arises if blocks have the same content but different locations, causing the comparison to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to include considering the block's locations in addition to the content. Sorting the blocks based on their content and locations before comparing them should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function now considers both the content and the locations of blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. It should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test provided.
