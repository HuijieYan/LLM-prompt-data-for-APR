### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function fails to return the correct result when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The function currently checks if the lengths of the axes and blocks are equal and then proceeds to compare each block. However, the comparison logic of the blocks is not handling cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the function to account for blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function not considering blocks with identical content but different locations. This issue results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing such blocks.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique identifier for each block that considers both the type name and the content of the block.
2. Use the modified `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparing them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are treated as different blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update canonicalize function to consider type name and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both type name and content, the corrected function ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as different blocks during comparison. This modification addresses the bug reported on GitHub and fixes the comparison logic in the `equals` function.
