### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes and blocks of two different instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes are equal and if each block is equal by iterating through and comparing the blocks.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of blocks, where the blocks are being sorted and compared based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which might not accurately identify unconsolidated blocks.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` having different data types. The `equals` function should return `False` as the columns do not match.
4. A better approach to fixing the bug would be to compare the elements in each block directly to detect any differences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is in the block comparison logic. It is sorting the blocks based on data type name and manager locations which may not correctly match unconsolidated blocks. This results in the function returning `True` even when the blocks are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the elements of each block directly instead of relying on sorting and comparing based on data type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
``` 

This corrected version compares each block directly using the `equals` method of each block, ensuring accurate comparison and resolving the bug.
