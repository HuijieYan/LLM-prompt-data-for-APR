### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with swapped values for columns 'a' and 'b', then checks if they are equal using the `equals` function, which is expected to return `False`.
4. The bug causes the function to wrongly return `True` in certain cases where blocks have identical values but different locations.
5. We need to update the comparison logic in the function to handle cases where block locations are different but the values are the same.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to handle the comparison of blocks in a way that considers the actual values rather than just their locations.
2. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to factor in the actual values of the blocks in addition to the type name and locations.
3. By incorporating the block values in the comparison, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering values, type name, and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to include `block.get_values()` along with `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Using the updated `canonicalize` function, the blocks are now sorted based on their values, type names, and locations.
3. The comparison now takes into account the actual values of the blocks, ensuring a correct equality check for `BlockManager` instances.
