### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the axes, block locations, and block types of the two objects to determine equality. The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of block objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way block objects are compared inside the `equals` function. The function compares block objects by sorting them based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might lead to incorrect comparisons if the block locations are different but the block contents are actually the same.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the block contents directly instead of relying on the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in `self` and `other` for equality, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual block contents.

By using this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
