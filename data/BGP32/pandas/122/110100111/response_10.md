### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` only if they are equal. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes it to return `False` even when the blocks are identical but have different locations.
   
2. The bug occurs during the comparison of blocks while iterating through them. The comparison should be based on the actual block data, not just the order of blocks.

3. The bug causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to incorrectly assert that two data frames are not equal because of the bug in the `equals` function implementation.

4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual block data in addition to the block order. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data values in the tuple that is used for sorting the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the block data values along with type name and manager locations.
2. Compare block data in addition to block order in the final comparison step.
3. Modify the `equals` function to reflect the corrected logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs and block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block data values in the comparison step along with the type name and manager locations. It should now pass the failing test and correctly compare the blocks for equality.
