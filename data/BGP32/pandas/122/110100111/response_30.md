### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality, checking axes, blocks, and their content.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames with columns in the opposite order, expecting `False` from the `equals()` method.
3. The bug causes the method to return `True` erroneously for DataFrames with similar blocks but different locations of them.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug in the `equals()` method arises when comparing blocks due to the failure to consider block locations. Sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs (block locations) is necessary to correctly compare them.
2. The bug results in identical blocks being deemed unequal due to differing locations, leading to an incorrect `True` return when they should be `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include block locations in the comparison process. Sorting the blocks based on a combination of dtype and mgr_locs before comparing them will ensure correct equality evaluation.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected `equals()` function now sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before comparing them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are evaluated correctly, fixing the bug indicated in the GitHub issue.
