### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks to determine equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in reverse order and expects them to be not equal.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a bug where the `equals` method wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` method occurs because the comparison of blocks is not considering the block locations, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include the block locations in determining equality between blocks. Sort the blocks based on type name and manager locations tuple to compare blocks consistently.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected function considers the block locations, leading to correct equality comparisons between `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
