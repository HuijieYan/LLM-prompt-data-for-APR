### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be caused by an improper comparison of the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects due to different locations but identical content.
3. The failing test function is checking if two dataframes are not equal, and this check involves the `equals()` function of `BlockManager`.
4. The bug is causing the `equals()` function to return `True` incorrectly when blocks have the same content but different locations.
5. We need to modify the comparison of blocks within the `equals()` function to account for block location differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to consider block contents along with their locations to determine equality accurately.
2. Instead of directly comparing blocks, we should compare the block contents within the blocks to confirm equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we include the block contents in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are regarded as equal. This change should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
