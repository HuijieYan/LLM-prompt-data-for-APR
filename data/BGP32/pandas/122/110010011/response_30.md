### Analysis:
- The `BlockManager` class contains a method `equals` that is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
- The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False` according to the test assertion.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where identical blocks with different locations are erroneously evaluated as equal.

### Error Location:
1. The comparison begins by checking if the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are different.
2. It then compares each pair of axes to check if they are equal by calling the `equals` method on each pair.
3. Next, it consolidates the blocks of both instances in place.
4. Finally, it compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager` instance and then compares every block to check for equality.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison method is not correctly handling the possibility of blocks with identical data but different locations. When consolidating the blocks and sorting them, the comparison does not take into account that the ordering may change due to different internal locations of identical values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to correctly handle cases where blocks are structurally identical but may have different internal locations due to consolidation. One approach could be to compare the actual block data instead of relying solely on the block order.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()

    return all(
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and block.items.equals(oblock.items)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the block locations and items directly to ensure that the comparison is correct even if the internal block order changes during consolidation.
