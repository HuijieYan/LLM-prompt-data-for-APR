### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
2. The error message indicates that for the given dataframes `df1` and `df2`, the `equals` method erroneously returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely the mismatch in the comparison of axes and blocks due to the unsorted nature of the blocks within the dataframes.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure a consistent block order by sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks within both instances of `BlockManager` based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them.
2. Update the `equals` method to perform this sorted comparison.
3. Test the corrected version with the failing test to ensure it now returns `False` for the provided dataframes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class members and methods remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Using the corrected `equals` method above should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the comparison between dataframes more robust.
