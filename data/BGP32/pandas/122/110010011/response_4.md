### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects using their axes and blocks. If the axes lengths are not equal or if any of the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it consolidates the blocks and compares them.
2. The error message indicates that when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that in cases of identical blocks with different locations, the `equals` method wrongly returns `True`.
4. One potential error location is the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on type name and locations, which might not correctly handle the comparison of blocks.
5. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function doesn't take into account the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data within the blocks for a more accurate comparison.
2. Update how the blocks are compared to ensure the equality check is done based on the content of the blocks rather than just their names and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on content
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making these modifications, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects based on the content of their blocks rather than just their names and locations. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
