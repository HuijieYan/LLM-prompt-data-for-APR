### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the class `BlockManager` compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message shows that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` in the test is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The error message refers to a GitHub issue where the problem is described as DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not handling blocks with different locations correctly during the comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers not just the content of the blocks but also their locations.

### Fixes:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations.
- Update the `equals` function to take block locations into account during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.eq(oblock.mgr_locs).all()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals` function to consider block locations in addition to block content during comparison, the corrected version should now accurately determine equality between two instances of `BlockManager`.
