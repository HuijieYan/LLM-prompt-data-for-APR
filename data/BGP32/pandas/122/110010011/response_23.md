### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:** The `equals` method is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error likely stems from the comparison logic within the `equals` method, especially the sorting of blocks based on type name and manager locations.

3. **Cause of Bug:**
   - The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion fails, suggesting that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly.
   - The GitHub issue further clarifies that the bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - We need to ensure that the comparison logic compares the blocks correctly without treating blocks with identical content but different locations as equal.
   - Modify the sorting and comparison mechanism to focus on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content and dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_numpy(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function focuses on block content and dtype name, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are not treated as equal. This modification should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
