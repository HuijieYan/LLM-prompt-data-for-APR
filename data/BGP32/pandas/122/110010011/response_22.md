### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects which are essentially containers for DataFrame blocks. It checks if the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the specific problem where the implementation of the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which is not the expected behavior.
4. The problem arises when the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on data type and location. If identical blocks are found with different locations, they can still be considered equal by mistake.
5. A possible strategy to fix this bug would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional attributes that uniquely identify each block. This would ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal mistakenly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs and shape for uniqueness
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.str, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the shape of the block, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations will not be falsely identified as equal. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
