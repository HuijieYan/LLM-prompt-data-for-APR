### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison fails when comparing two instances of `DataFrame`.
3. The error message specifically states: `assert True is False`, which means that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is wrongly returning `True` in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Issue with canonicalization of blocks.
2. Inconsistencies in the sorting or comparison of blocks.
3. Incorrect comparison between `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function might arise due to the incorrect canonicalization of blocks. If two blocks are identical in content but have different locations (unconsolidated blocks), the comparison fails to recognize them as equal. This leads to the method erroneously returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison within the `equals` function takes into account the content of the blocks rather than just their locations. By adjusting the comparison logic to consider the actual data stored in the blocks, we can identify if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their content rather than their internal block structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_empty_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_empty_blocks()

    for block_loc in self._iter_optimizations():
        sdata = self.blocks[block_loc]
        odata = other.blocks[block_loc]
        if not sdata.equals(odata):
            return False

    return True

def get_empty_blocks(self):
    empty_blocks = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block.is_empty:
            empty_blocks.append(block)
    return empty_blocks
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. We compare the content of the blocks using the `equals` method of individual blocks.
2. We correctly handle unconsolidated blocks by implementing `get_empty_blocks` to filter out empty blocks.
3. The `equals` method now correctly compares the blocks' internal data to determine equality.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager` and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
