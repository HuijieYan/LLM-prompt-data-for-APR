### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The error message indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, which implies that the `equals()` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. The GitHub issue points out that in cases of identical blocks with different locations, the `equals()` function returns `True` wrongly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function compares the blocks using a sorted order, which may lead to incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that block comparison takes into account not only the sorted order but also the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not just sorted order
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their content directly instead of relying solely on a sorted order, this corrected version of the `equals()` function should address the bug and provide the expected behavior when comparing DataFrames.
