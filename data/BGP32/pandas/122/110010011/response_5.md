### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function checks if the axes of the two objects are equal first, then consolidates the blocks within each object before comparing them.
   
2. The error arises from the incorrect comparison of two dataframes in the failing test. The `df1` and `df2` dataframes have columns swapped compared to each other, leading to the assertion failure in the test case.

3. The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not handling the case where data can be identical but in different locations, leading to a false positive in the equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class does not correctly handle comparing data blocks that are identical but have different locations within the data structures. This leads to false positives in equality comparisons for dataframes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `equals` function to account for cases where blocks are identical but have different locations. We should sort the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparing them. This will eliminate any false positives in the equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on data type and locations before comparing them in the `equals` function, the corrected version eliminates the false positives that were occurring in the original buggy implementation. This fix addresses the issue reported on the GitHub page and ensures that the equality comparison behaves as expected.
