### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to check the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with similar blocks but different locations.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be the comparison of blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the location information of blocks for a more accurate comparison.
5. We can update the `equals` function to account for block locations while comparing, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are not considered equal.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class definitions and methods remain unchanged
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # include block locations
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the block locations in the `canonicalize` function, we can now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances and resolve the issue of returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
