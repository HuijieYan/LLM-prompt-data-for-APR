### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is not working as expected, leading to an AssertionError when comparing two DataFrames.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the error message provided.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes between the two BlockManager objects.
2. Comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager objects.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks before comparison in the `equals` method. The comparison is based on the dtype name and the location of the blocks, which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered different.
- Since the blocks are being sorted based on their locations before comparison, two equivalent DataFrames might have their blocks shuffled in different order, resulting in a false negative comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:
1. Sort blocks in a consistent way that doesn't consider the location of the blocks.
2. Perform element-wise comparison of blocks without relying on their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted([block.values for block in self.blocks])
    other_blocks = sorted([block.values for block in other.blocks])
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses `np.array_equal` to compare blocks in an element-wise manner without considering their order. This ensures that the comparison is consistent even if blocks are in different locations within the BlockManager objects.
