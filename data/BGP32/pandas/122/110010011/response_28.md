### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` returned `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different values.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the wrong behavior of `DataFrame.equals()` returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug is caused by the comparison not taking into account the different block locations, leading to incorrect equality check.
5. We need to modify the comparison logic to include checking for identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we will need to update the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to properly handle cases where there are identical blocks with different locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's position in the sorting key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs including location index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's location index in the `canonicalize` function and using it for sorting, we can address the issue of `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
