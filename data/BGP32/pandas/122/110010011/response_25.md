### Identify the bug:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class and return `False` if they are not equal. However, due to a bug, the function returns `True` incorrectly even when the blocks have different locations.

### Explain the bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort and identify blocks does not consider the location of the blocks. Hence, even if the blocks have the same data but different locations, they are considered equal. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks. By including the location information, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are treated as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
I have modified the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())  # Add block.values for comparison
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `values` of the block in the comparison, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This modification should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
