### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is not properly comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It is failing to return the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with the same blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Incorrect comparison of blocks in `self` and `other`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. In this case, the function fails to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when the blocks are not in the same order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in `self` and `other` objects accounts for blocks that might have the same data but different locations. One way to address this issue is by sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that considers both the type name and block locations to ensure consistent comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of comparing blocks with the same data but different locations by using a canonical representation based on both the block type name and the block locations. This ensures that the comparison is consistent and returns the correct result when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
