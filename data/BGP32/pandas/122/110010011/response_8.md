### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it is wrongly returning True even when the DataFrames are not equal due to identical blocks with different locations.
- The GitHub issue confirms this problem and provides a reproducing code snippet that showcases the issue.
- The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function is comparing blocks within the DataFrames without considering the block locations.

### Error Location:
The error is likely originating from how the function `canonicalize` is used to sort and compare blocks without considering block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing blocks based on their content without considering their original locations. Two DataFrames can have identical blocks (same content) but in different physical locations within the DataFrames. The function fails to detect the structural difference between the two DataFrames which leads to an incorrect equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison in the `equals` method should consider both the block content and their locations. By incorporating the block locations in the comparison, the function will correctly identify DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the fixed version of the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now considers the block locations during comparison, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
