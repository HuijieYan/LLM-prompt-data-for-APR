### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas.
- The error message states that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that `df1.equals(df2)` returned `True` when it was expected to return `False`.
- The provided GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function is incorrect.
2. The sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might be flawed.
3. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks may not be effective.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the comparison logic in the `BlockManager.equals` function. It fails to correctly identify when two DataFrames have identical blocks but at different locations, leading to a false positive result.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Specifically, we should ensure that the comparison considers the blocks' contents rather than their locations. One approach could be to sort both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block contents before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's values to sort the blocks, ensuring that the comparison focuses on the block contents. This should resolve the issue with `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks at different locations.
