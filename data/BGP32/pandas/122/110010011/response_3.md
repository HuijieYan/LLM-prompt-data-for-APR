### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The function compares the shape and contents of the `BlockManager` objects by examining their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` for objects that should be considered unequal.
4. The GitHub issue further clarifies that the incorrect behavior occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` instances.
2. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, which may result in identical blocks getting compared.
3. In the provided example, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for `df1.equals(df2)` due to the incorrect comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare blocks based on their actual content to determine equality.
2. Iterate over the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances and compare the content of each block directly to ensure accuracy.
3. Ensure that any sorting of blocks is based on their content or any unique identifier within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The fixed version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances based on the content of their blocks. This update should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the comparison of blocks results in the expected outcome.
