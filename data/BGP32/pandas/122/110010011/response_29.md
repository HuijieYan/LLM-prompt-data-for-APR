### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The function is used to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes: `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))`.
2. Canonicalization of blocks: `return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`.
3. Comparison of blocks: `return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method incorrectly considers two DataFrames with identical data but different locations as equal, leading to a wrong comparison result. This happens due to the canonicalization of blocks using type names and locations, which does not account for cases where blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared in the `equals` method. Instead of canonicalizing blocks by type names and locations, we should directly compare the content of blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the `values` of the blocks instead of their canonicalized versions. This modification ensures that the comparison considers the actual data content, leading to a correct result when checking for equality.
