### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects using the `equals` method returned `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where the `equals` method behaves incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be in the sorting logic inside the `equals` method that sorts blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic to properly handle comparisons between identical blocks in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. We should prioritize sorting based on type name first and then consider `mgr_locs` if necessary.
2. After updating the sorting logic, the comparison should be between the blocks based on type and then, if required, on location.
3. By correctly sorting the blocks, we can ensure that identical blocks in different locations are properly compared for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalization function to sort blocks correctly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making these changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects and address the issue reported on GitHub.
