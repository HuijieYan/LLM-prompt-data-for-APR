### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the Pandas library is not functioning correctly. It is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`, but there are issues when comparing the internal block data.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of the lengths of axes between the two instances.
2. Comparison of each block within the `BlockManager`.
3. Sorting and canonicalization of blocks to ensure proper comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, showing that the function is incorrectly returning `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by properly sorting and comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The comparison of axes length should also be accurate. Canonicalization of blocks should ensure that equivalent blocks are recognized correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Extract dtype name and mgr_locs as a list
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks within the `BlockManager` are sorted and compared accurately, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
