### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the equality of two `BlockManager` objects, specifically comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, leading to an unexpected assertion error.
3. The error message indicates that the test expected the comparison to return `False`, but it returned `True`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The root cause of the bug lies in the comparison of blocks with different memory locations, causing the incorrect result.
6. To fix this, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the block content equality, not just the memory locations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
          
        if self.shape != other.shape:  # Check if shapes are identical
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtypes, block.values.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the fix above, we added a check to compare the shapes of the `BlockManager` objects and modified the `canonicalize` function to compare block content by data types and values. This change ensures that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks, leading to a proper equality check for `BlockManager` objects.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by considering the block content equality when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
