### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The error message is indicating that the method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. The method is not properly handling the comparison logic in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to properly handle blocks with different locations but the same content.
5. We need to modify the `equals` function to address this issue.

### Fixing the Bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(map(tuple, block.values.tolist())))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method now compares blocks based on the content rather than just the locations, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
