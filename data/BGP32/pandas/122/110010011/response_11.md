### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two objects by sorting and comparing their blocks, but not handling cases where the blocks have different locations.
2. The failing test is checking if two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are equal using the `equals()` method, which is failing due to the buggy behavior of the function.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is returning `True` instead.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug is related to identical blocks with different locations not being handled correctly by the `equals()` method.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class to consider block locations while comparing the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations information in addition to dtype name.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to consider block locations during block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` method should handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared correctly.
