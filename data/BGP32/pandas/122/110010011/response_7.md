### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails where `True` is returned instead of `False`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` when faced with identical blocks placed at different locations.
4. The bug is likely due to the implementation of the `equals` function not considering the order of blocks properly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the original implementation of the `equals` function does not sort or align the blocks in a consistent manner before doing the element-wise comparison. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks are identical but in different locations, as seen in the failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks before performing the equality check. By sorting the blocks based on a defined key (such as block type and location), we can ensure that blocks appearing in different locations but containing the same data are aligned correctly before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a key function for sorting based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort blocks based on the defined key
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks using a key function that takes into consideration both the data type name and the block's locations, we ensure that the blocks are aligned properly before comparison. This corrected version should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
