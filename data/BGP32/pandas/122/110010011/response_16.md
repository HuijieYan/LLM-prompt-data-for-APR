### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class. The main issue arises when sorting the blocks within the instances for comparison. The comparison process is incorrect, leading to a false positive result.

### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of axes lengths.
2. Comparison of individual axes using the `equals` method.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks within the instances.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug originates from the incorrect sorting of blocks within the instances. The method `canonicalize()` is used to sort the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting method fails to account for scenarios where blocks with different locations are still equal. Consequently, the comparison based on the sorted blocks leads to a false positive result, indicating equality between instances that are not equal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` method. Instead of directly comparing the sorted blocks, we should implement a comparison mechanism that correctly identifies equal blocks even if their locations differ.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Custom comparison of blocks to handle same content with different locations
        def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
            return block._equals(oblock)  # Custom comparison for equality
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.shape, x.dtypes))  # Sort by shape and dtype
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.shape, x.dtypes))  # Sort by shape and dtype
        
        return all(
            compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are sorted based on their shape and datatype, and a custom comparison function `_equals` is used to compare the blocks rather than the default `equals` method, allowing for equality checks that consider the content regardless of location.
