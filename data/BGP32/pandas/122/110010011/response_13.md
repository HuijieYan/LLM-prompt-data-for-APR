### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method, where the location of blocks is not properly accounted for.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `equals` method:
- We need to modify the comparison logic between blocks in a way that considers identical blocks with different locations as not equal.
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for their positions in memory.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Canonicalize block order based on type and locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._get_numeric_data().values.__array_interface__['data'], block.dtype.name)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both block type and locations, and then sorting and comparing the blocks based on this information, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled in the `equals` method.
