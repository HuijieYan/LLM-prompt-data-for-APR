### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` defined in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The error message is showing that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`, indicating that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is incorrect.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the `equals` method is wrongly returning `True` when the blocks are identical but have different locations, which aligns with the error message received.
4. The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks with the function `canonicalize`. If blocks have the same content but different locations, they will be sorted differently, leading to `equals` returning `True` incorrectly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include location information as well to ensure identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the `canonicalize` function considers not only the block contents but also their locations. By using `tobytes()` instead of `tolist()`, we ensure that the block locations are also taken into account in determining equality.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function more robust when comparing blocks with different locations.
