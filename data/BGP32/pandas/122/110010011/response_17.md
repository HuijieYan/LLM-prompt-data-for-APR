### Analysis:
1. **Relationship with Buggy Class**: The `equals` method is defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. **Error Location**: The issue arises in the comparison of DataFrame blocks within the `equals` method.
3. **Cause of the Bug**: The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks due to different locations, leading to the method returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, accounting for the different block positions.
5. **Correction**:
   - Correct the block comparison logic by considering block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Corrected block comparison by considering block positions
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())  # Use 'tolist()' to compare block locations

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Applying the correction above should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make sure that the `equals` method correctly compares DataFrame blocks, accounting for different locations.
