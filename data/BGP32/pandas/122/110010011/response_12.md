### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks and sorts them before comparing each block for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks after sorting them in the `equals` function. Sorting the blocks by a combination of dtype name and mgr_locs induces an incorrect order for the comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting does not necessarily preserve the correct order for comparison, leading to the function erroneously returning `True`. The comparisons should be based on the original order of blocks rather than sorted order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in the original order instead of sorting them. By comparing blocks in their original sequence, we can correctly determine whether the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
