### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks in two instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison logic involves sorting the blocks, and then checking if each corresponding pair of blocks are equal.
2. The failing test is checking if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method, but the test is erroneously returning True instead of False, leading to the failure.
3. The issue arises from the sorting of blocks in the `equals` function. The blocks are sorted based on a combination of data type name and manager locations, which can lead to inconsistent comparison results when block locations differ.
4. To fix the bug, a better approach would involve comparing blocks directly without sorting to ensure accurate equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class based on the analysis:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, the function will accurately identify differences, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
