Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function, the issue in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers, which causes the comparison to incorrectly return `True`.

The mismatch is caused by the ordering of blocks before comparison. To resolve this bug, we need to canonize the block ordering based on data type and manager locations before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the type of the block, the block's dtype, and the manager locations to properly order the blocks before comparison.

This modification should address the issue of blocks with identical data and different locations incorrectly resulting in `True` during the comparison. The corrected function will now return `False` as expected in cases where the block locations differ despite having the same data. This fix should resolve the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
