### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Related Function:**
   - The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager instances by checking their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks in a sorted order.
   - The related functions `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` are called within the buggy function to process the data before comparison.
  
2. **Error Location:**
   - The bug lies in the comparison logic where it checks if the lengths of axes are equal, then if all axes are equal, consolidates the data, and finally compares the sorted blocks.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, even though they contain different values (e.g., integer vs. string in columns).
   - The function is not properly handling the data blocks for comparison, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - The function should correctly compare the values within the blocks for each column, ensuring that the data itself is being correctly compared.
   - Check and compare the individual values within each block while iterating over corresponding blocks from the two BlockManager instances.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block = self_blocks[i]
        oblock = other_blocks[i]

        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

Running the failing test scenario with the corrected function should now result in `False` as expected for the comparison of `df1.equals(df2)`.
