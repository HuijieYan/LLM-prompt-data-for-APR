### Explanation of the Bug

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test to return `True` instead of the expected `False`. The function is comparing the blocks of two instances of `BlockManager` based on their attributes, including `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect retrieval and comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute.

### Issues in the Bug
1. The `canonicalize` function used to compare the blocks does not correctly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute, leading to incorrect comparison results.
2. As a result, even when the blocks are not equal, the function incorrectly returns `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly account for the `mgr_locs` attribute when comparing blocks.
2. Ensure that the comparison considers all relevant attributes of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering all attributes for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include both `dtype.name` and `str(block.mgr_locs)`, the blocks will be correctly compared based on all relevant attributes, resolving the bug and ensuring the failing test behaves as expected.
