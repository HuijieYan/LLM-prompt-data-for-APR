### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function results in returning `True` even when the two `BlockManager` objects have different block orders due to inconsistent handling of block canonicalization. The function sorts blocks based on block type and manager locations, which may not always provide the expected block comparison. As a result, the function fails to correctly determine when two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a more robust and accurate way of comparing the block contents is needed. The comparison should directly check each block's content without relying on sorting based on block type and manager locations. This will ensure a proper check for equality between `BlockManager` objects.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Check equality of blocks directly without sorting
        for label, block in self.blocks.items():
            if label not in other.blocks:
                return False
            if not block.equals(other.blocks[label]):
                return False

        return True
``` 

This corrected version directly compares the blocks present in both `BlockManager` objects without sorting. It iterates over each block in one `BlockManager` and checks for its presence and equality in the other `BlockManager`. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison and should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
