### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The goal of this method is to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and blocks' contents.
2. The error message indicates that for a specific test case, the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, with the condition `assert True is False`. This implies that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly, indicating equality when it should not.
3. The `equals` method compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates both instances using `_consolidate_inplace` before comparing the blocks. The issue could be related to incorrect block comparisons or the consolidation process.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the block ordering and comparison are done correctly while handling the case where blocks might have different locations but are identical in content.
5. The expected behavior is for the `equals` method to return `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with the provided input.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())  # Change block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() to block.values.tolist()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to use `block.values.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we can ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. This fix should address the incorrect `equals` return value seen in the failing test.
