### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking the axes, consolidating the data, and comparing individual blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, suggesting that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` returned `True` incorrectly.
3. The bug might be caused by the sorting of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, which leads to the comparison producing incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparison to guarantee accurate equality checking.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the sorting process of the blocks before comparison. By ensuring a consistent and appropriate sorting mechanism, we can guarantee that the comparison between two BlockManagers is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the data type as a string representation and sorting the blocks based on this information along with `mgr_locs`, we can ensure consistent order for comparison. This corrected version should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` method works as expected.
