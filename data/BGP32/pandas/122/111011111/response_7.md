### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by their axes, blocks, and block order. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results. In the failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with different values in their columns, resulting in the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True`.

The specific issue arises from the comparison of blocks in a tuple that combines the dtype name and manager locations. Due to the wrong comparison logic, the function thinks that the two `BlockManager` instances are equal, even though their content differs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of how the blocks are compared. One approach is to compare the actual content of each block instead of relying on the block order and dtype name. By comparing the values within the blocks directly, we can ensure an accurate check for equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare the block values for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each block in `self.blocks` and compare it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` using the `equals` method of the blocks themselves. This ensures a proper comparison of the block content and resolves the issue causing incorrect equality checks.
