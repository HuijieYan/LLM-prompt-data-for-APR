## Bug Fix Strategy

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their attributes like `axes`, `blocks`, and their elements.
2. The failing test provided creates two `DataFrame` objects, `df1` and `df2`, with columns 'a' and 'b' having different types and values.
3. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails and returns `True`.
4. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises because the comparison between blocks in the `equals` function is ambiguous when the blocks have the same attributes but different locations. This leads to incorrect evaluation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison strategy for the `blocks` within the `BlockManager` objects. Focus on comparing the block attributes, types, and values rather than relying on block locations.
2. We can ensure a consistent comparison by sorting the blocks based on their attributes and then comparing.

### Corrected Function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define a key function to canonicalize blocks based on dtype and values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.values), block.dtype)
        
        # Sort the blocks to ensure consistent order for comparison
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

### The corrected function addresses the bug by sorting the blocks in both BlockManager objects based on their values and dtype before comparison. This ensures a consistent comparison and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
