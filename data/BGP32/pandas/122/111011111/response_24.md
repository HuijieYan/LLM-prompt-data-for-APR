### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks in a DataFrame with identical data, but different locations. The comparison currently sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may lead to comparing different blocks as equal, resulting in an incorrect equality check.

The error message shows that the expected output is False, but the actual output is True, indicating a failure in the equality comparison of the two DataFrames. This bug violates the expected behavior and fails the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the block comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of solely relying on the sorting criteria of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the actual data values in the blocks to ensure correct equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])  # Compare blocks by data values
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])  # Compare blocks by data values
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. We sort the blocks based on their first data value rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. This change ensures that we compare blocks by their actual data values, leading to a more accurate equality check.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly evaluate the equality of DataFrames and pass the failing test case.
