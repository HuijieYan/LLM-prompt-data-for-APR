### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, where it wrongly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) that have identical blocks but at different locations. This behavior is unintended and leads to failing test cases where the expected output should be `False`.

#### Identified issues:
1. The implementation of the `equals` function does not handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently.
2. The sorting of blocks within lists (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) using the `canonicalize` function does not consider block locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. We should ensure that blocks are compared based on their actual content rather than their locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we use a lambda function when sorting blocks to consider both values and locations. This ensures that the comparison reflects the actual content of the blocks rather than their positions, resolving the bug.
