### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, then consolidating them in place, and finally comparing their blocks. If any of these steps fail, it returns `False`.
2. The bug likely arises from the order of blocks comparison using `sorted`, which mismatches with the expected block order, leading to a false positive `True` return.
3. The runtime values show that the block order is not properly determined using `canonicalize`, causing the comparison to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block data along with its attributes for a more accurate comparison.
5. Implement the fixed function below.

### Fixed Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define new canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        coords = block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        block_data = block.values.to_numpy().tobytes()  # Convert to bytes for comparison
        return (block.dtype.name, coords, block_data)

    # Sort blocks based on additional block data
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix enhances the `canonicalize` function to include the block data in the comparison, ensuring that blocks with identical content in different locations are correctly identified.
