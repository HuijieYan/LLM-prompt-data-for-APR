### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the BlockManager's `self` and `other` attributes. If their axes are not equal, it returns False. Then it consolidates both BlockManager objects in place and compares their blocks. However, the comparison logic seems to fail in the provided case.
2. The failing test indicates that the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are considered equal when they are not, leading to the assertion fail.
3. The function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations before iterating over them in a comparison loop. The sorting might not be working as expected causing the wrong comparison results.
4. The bug seems to be related to sorting the blocks during comparison in `equals` function. Ensuring that the sorting is done correctly and the comparison between blocks is accurate should resolve the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the sorting mechanism to ensure the correct order for comparing blocks.
2. Verify the block comparison logic to accurately determine if two blocks are equal.
3. Allow for consistent identification and comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.coords)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks after sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted based on type name and manager locations before comparing them. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and fix the failing test case.
