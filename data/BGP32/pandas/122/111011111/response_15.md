### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. However, the comparison logic currently fails to consider the locations of blocks when sorting them for comparison. This leads to incorrect results where two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations are considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be modified to account for block locations. By incorporating block locations into the comparison process, the function will correctly identify cases where two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks but differ in block locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers block locations by using `block.mgr_locs` directly in the tuple. This change ensures that blocks are sorted based on both their type name and locations, allowing for an accurate comparison between `BlockManager` instances.
