### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManagers by checking if their attributes are equal. It first compares the lengths of their axes, then checks if each axis is equal by iterating through them. After that, it consolidates both BlockManagers in place and compares the lengths of their blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both BlockManagers based on a canonical order and checks if each corresponding block is equal.
   
2. The failing test is checking if two DataFrames are not equal by using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` returned `True is False`, implying that the equality check was incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function's logic is flawed in the block comparison step. It sorts the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, it mistakenly compares the dtype name (`block.dtype.name`) of the blocks instead of comparing the actual block values. This results in the equality test failing even when the blocks have the same content.

2. The failing test creates two DataFrames with columns swapped, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` due to different data. However, the buggy comparison function incorrectly returns `True`, leading to a failed assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by comparing the actual block values instead of just the dtype names when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the correct comparison is made based on the block contents rather than just their data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After the Fix:
The corrected version of the function will now correctly compare the block values instead of just their dtype names. This will result in the expected behavior for comparing two BlockManagers, and the failing test should pass successfully.
