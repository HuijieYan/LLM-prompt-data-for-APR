### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the blocks in different orders causing the test to fail.
2. The test case expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal but the function returns `True`.
3. The function sorts the blocks in `self` and `other` DataFrames based on block properties, leading to the comparison issue.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the incorrect behavior where identical blocks with different locations were wrongly evaluated as equals.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self` and `other` DataFrames are sorted and compared correctly. Sorting should be based on unique block properties to ensure accurate equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix for the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function now correctly compares the blocks based on their properties, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are not mistakenly evaluated as equal.
