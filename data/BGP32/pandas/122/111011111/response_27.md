The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The issue arises when trying to compare the blocks by using the `equals` method directly, as some blocks might actually have the same content but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to take into account the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks as well when comparing them. We'll modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` information in the tuple for better distinction between blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version should properly compare the blocks taking into consideration their content as well as their locations, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

By incorporating the `mgr_locs` information into the comparison, identical blocks with different locations should now be correctly identified as different blocks, and the `equals` function will return the expected result.
