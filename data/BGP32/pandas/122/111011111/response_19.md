The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the mishandling of block locations. When comparing two block managers, the function incorrectly returns `True` if the blocks are identical but have different locations. This behavior is not expected, as the content of the blocks should be the criteria for equality.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the content of blocks and ignore their locations. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block data to compare content only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the content of the blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the block values instead of their locations, the corrected version of the function ensures that the equality check is based on the actual data in the blocks. This change should now make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test.
