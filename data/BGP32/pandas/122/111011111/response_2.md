The cause of the bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function does not consider the locations of the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality checks even when the blocks are identical but in different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for the block locations. We can achieve this by updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information. This way, blocks with the same content but different locations will not be considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, including the location information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated logic, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` based on their content and location. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
