### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the comparison of blocks being incorrect. The function compares blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and returns whether they are equal. However, the comparison is flawed because it doesn't consider the order of blocks. It sorts the blocks based on the tuple of the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect results if the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks based on the tuple of dtype name and `mgr_locs`, we need to compare blocks based on their data directly to ensure that the comparison is correct.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the blocks directly without sorting based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, the `equals` function should now correctly identify if the blocks are equal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
