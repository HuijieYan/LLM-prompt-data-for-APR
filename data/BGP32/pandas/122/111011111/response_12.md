### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` by their order instead of their content, leading to incorrect equality assessments. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function that uses block's dtype and manager locations. The bug arises because the dtype and manager locations are compared as a tuple, leading to mismatched comparisons with `oblock` (blocks from `other_blocks`) in the `zip` loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should consider both dtype and manager locations separately to ensure the correct comparison. By sorting the blocks based on dtype first and then on manager locations if the dtype is the same, we can accurately compare blocks from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.key, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on dtype name, manager key, and manager indexer, the corrected function accurately compares the blocks and appropriately determines their equality. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
