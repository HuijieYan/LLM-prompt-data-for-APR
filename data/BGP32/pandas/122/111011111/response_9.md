### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of pandas.
2. The function compares two BlockManagers for equality by checking if their axes, consolidated blocks, and sorted blocks are equal.
3. The failing test asserts that two DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns True.
4. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks. The function is not handling the case where identical blocks have different locations, resulting in incorrect equality.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks properly accounts for different locations.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include information about block locations.
2. Update the sorting of blocks to consider both the type name and the block locations.
3. Ensure that the comparison between sorted blocks accounts for the differences in block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))  # Include block locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations, sorting the blocks based on both type name and locations, and adjusting the comparison accordingly, the corrected version should now properly handle comparisons between identical blocks with different locations.
