### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations due to unconsolidated blocks. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly considered as unequal.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the content of the blocks to handle unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation: 
1. In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now combines the block values and the dtype name to ensure correct comparison, considering unconsolidated blocks as well.
2. Sorting the blocks based on this new canonicalization logic helps in aligning identical blocks even if their locations differ.
3. The comparison is then done on the sorted blocks to determine equality.

By correcting the comparison logic to handle unconsolidated blocks properly, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass.
