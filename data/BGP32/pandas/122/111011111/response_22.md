### Identified Bug
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two instances without considering block locations. This leads to erroneous results in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations, causing the function to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The comparison of blocks should not depend on `mgr_locs` as it can vary even if the blocks are identical.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to exclude `mgr_locs` from the tuple comparison and sort blocks based solely on `dtype.name`. This will ensure that blocks with the same data type are considered equivalent during the equality check.

### Corrected Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only include the data type name in the tuple and sorting the blocks based on this modified key, the comparison will accurately determine the equality of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances.
