### Bug Analysis:
1. **Relationship with Buggy Class:** The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
   
2. **Related Functions:** The buggy function uses other related functions like `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` from the same class.
   
3. **Corresponding Error Message:** The error message states that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True` is not equal to `False`, where the comparison was expected to return `False`.

4. **Runtime I/O Values:**
   - The `self.axes` and `other.axes` contain lists of axes with index objects.
   - `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples containing block information.
   - Comparisons are done based on sorted blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
   
5. **Expected I/O Values:**
   - The expected input/output values for `self` and `other` remain the same.
   - The expected `self_axes`, `other_axes`, and block related variables should not undergo any change.
   
6. **GitHub Issue:** The issue describes that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be in the comparison logic where the function is sorting blocks by type name and their locations, but it does not consider the actual data within the blocks. This leads to false positives in cases where the data inside blocks is different but the block types and locations are similar.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic of blocks needs to be revised to check the actual content data instead of just the block type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by content data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

After fixing the comparison logic to check the content data in the blocks, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
