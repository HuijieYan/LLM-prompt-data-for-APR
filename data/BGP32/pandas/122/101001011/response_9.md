### Analysis
The `BlockManager.equals()` function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs when trying to sort the blocks based on their dtype and locations. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the function returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

### Error Location
The error is likely located in the sorting of blocks within the `BlockManager.equals()` function. Since the sorting is based on dtype and locations, it fails to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations as unequal.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is flawed in its approach to identifying blocks uniquely based on dtype and locations. This results in incorrect comparison and leads to the function returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you should adjust the comparison logic to correctly handle the comparison of blocks that may have the same content but different locations. A better approach would be to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their dtype and locations.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `BlockManager.equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version avoids sorting the blocks based on incorrect criteria and directly compares the content of the blocks to determine equality, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
