### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals()` method inside the `BlockManager` class of pandas.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
3. The bug might be related to the sorting of blocks before comparison, potentially causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute of blocks during the sorting process to determine block equality.
2. If two identical blocks have different `mgr_locs`, they might wrongly evaluate as unequal since the sorting based on locations is affecting the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid directly using `mgr_locs` for block comparison, as it can create false inequalities.
2. Restructure the comparison logic to focus on block content rather than location.
3. Implement a comparison method that disregards block locations to ensure correct equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.to_pandas().values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the `canonicalize` function to use block content bytes for comparison instead of `mgr_locs`.
2. Used `block.to_pandas().values.tobytes()` to represent block content uniquely.
3. Sorted blocks based on content representation for proper comparison.

By adjusting the comparison logic in this way, the function should correctly identify the equality of two `BlockManager` instances without being affected by the block locations.
