## Bug Analysis:
The bug appears to lie within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by iterating over their axes and blocks. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks, specifically in the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting mechanism needs to be adjusted to correctly handle comparing different blocks with the same data type but different locations.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the use of the `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks. Due to the use of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` as the sorting key, blocks with identical data types but different locations are not distinguished. This leads to incorrect results where identical blocks with different locations are considered equal.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block data itself for comparison, in addition to the data type and locations. By including the block's data in the comparison, we can correctly distinguish blocks with the same data type but different locations.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider block data for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.values` in the sorting key within the `canonicalize` function, the corrected function can distinguish blocks based on their actual data values in addition to the data type and locations. This modification should resolve the issue detected in the GitHub report.
