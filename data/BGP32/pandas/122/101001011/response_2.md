### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function returns `True` even when the blocks have identical data but are located differently.

### Error Location:
The bug lies in the comparison logic after sorting the blocks based on their data type and location. The function is incorrectly identifying non-equal blocks as equal due to not considering the block locations during comparison.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and location using the `canonicalize` function.
2. However, after sorting, the comparison is done directly between corresponding blocks, not considering the block locations.
3. This leads to equal blocks at different locations being considered equal, causing the function to return `True` even when the blocks are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to consider both the equality of blocks and their positions. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison step to explicitly check if the blocks are located at the same positions in both `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) and np.array_equal(block1.mgr_locs, block2.mgr_locs) 
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison step now includes an additional check to ensure that the blocks being compared are at the same locations in both `BlockManager` objects. This change addresses the bug reported on GitHub by correctly identifying equal blocks with different locations as not equal.
