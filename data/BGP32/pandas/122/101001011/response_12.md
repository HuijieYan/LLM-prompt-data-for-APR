### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals()` function is that it incorrectly returns True for DataFrames that have identical blocks but with different locations due to the usage of `block.mgr_locs` for sorting blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function is using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to sort the blocks. However, identical blocks with different locations will have different `mgr_locs`, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.
2. This bug results in the function wrongly returning True for DataFrames that should actually be considered different based on block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more appropriate method for sorting the blocks that ensures the correct comparison between identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new method for comparing and sorting blocks
    def compare_blocks(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to `compare_blocks` which uses `block.values` for comparison, we ensure that the identical blocks are sorted and compared correctly regardless of their memory locations. This corrected version should address the bug and make the `equals()` function return the correct results according to the GitHub issue description.
