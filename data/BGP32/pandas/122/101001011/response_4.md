### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of block locations during the equality check. The function incorrectly identifies blocks as equal even when they have different locations, leading to a wrong return value.

### Error Location:
The issue stems from the `canonicalize` function, which assigns a key for sorting blocks that includes the block's dtype name and the block's manager locations. If two identical blocks have different locations, the function still considers them equal. This incorrect comparison results in the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison logic used in creating a canonical representation of blocks based on dtype and manager locations. When two blocks have the same dtype but different manager locations, they should not be considered equal. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to accurately capture the uniqueness of blocks by considering both dtype and manager locations. By modifying the key generation approach, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly treated as equal during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes both the dtype name and the manager locations of the blocks for a more accurate comparison. This modification ensures that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
