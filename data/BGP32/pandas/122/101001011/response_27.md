### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class checks if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and their content.
- The bug seems to be related to sorting and comparing the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect results.

### Error location:
1. The `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values, causing incorrect comparison results.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug arises due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. This leads to incorrectly identifying blocks as equal or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent block characteristics for proper comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining dtype and block values to compare
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.__class__), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the class name of the block and the block's values for proper comparison. This ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
