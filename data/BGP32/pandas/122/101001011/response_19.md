### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `BlockManager` objects where the blocks are identical but their locations are different. This bug leads to returning `True` incorrectly instead of `False` when the expected output should be `False`.

### Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur in the comparison logic of identical blocks with different locations, specifically in how the blocks are sorted before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to consider the block contents while ignoring their locations. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on their content only, without considering the locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block content, ignoring locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.tostring()
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the content by converting the block values to a string representation. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly compared and return the correct result.
