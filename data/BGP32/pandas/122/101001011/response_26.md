### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects in a specific manner, considering the `axes` and `blocks` attributes.
2. The issue described in GitHub states that the function returns `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The root cause of the bug seems to be the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype and location which is causing the comparison to consider different locations as unequal blocks.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from sorting the blocks based on dtype and location using the `canonicalize` function. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being considered as different blocks, resulting in a false comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers identical blocks with different locations as equal. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based solely on the dtype, without considering the locations. This will allow for a correct comparison of blocks without taking into account their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name because the locations should not affect equality
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function only considers the dtype of the blocks for sorting, ignoring their locations. This ensures that blocks with the same data type are considered equal regardless of their locations, resolving the bug.
