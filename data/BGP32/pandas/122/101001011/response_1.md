### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function is comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` instances and their blocks.
2. The bug arises from comparing identical blocks with different locations incorrectly.
3. The function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which indicates the block's slice location.
4. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize()` function doesn't include the manager's `type` in the comparison of blocks, resulting in incorrect block comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Include the manager type in the `canonicalize()` function to ensure the comparison is based on both dtype name and block locations.
2. Update the sorting logic to consider the manager's type as well.
3. Add the manager's type to the sorted list comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), type(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function includes the manager's type in the sorting and comparison logic to ensure accurate block comparisons, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
