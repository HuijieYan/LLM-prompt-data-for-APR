### Identified Bug:
The bug causes `BlockManager.equals()` function to return `True` incorrectly when the blocks have the same content but different locations. This is due to sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, but the manager locations can be different even if the content is the same, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals()` function. We should compare the content of the blocks directly rather than relying on the ordering based on dtype name and manager locations. This will ensure that the equality evaluation is based on block content rather than block locations.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare block content for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the block content for equality, we ensure that the blocks are evaluated based on their actual content rather than their locations. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
