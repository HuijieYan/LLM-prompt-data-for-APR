### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares `self.axes` and `other.axes` in the beginning to check if they have the same length and elements. Then it sorts and compares `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on dtype and location.
2. The bug reported on the GitHub issue indicates that the function is incorrectly returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug is likely happening because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not properly consider the block locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.
4. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should include block locations in its tuple comparison.
5. Let's correct the buggy function by updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations and converting the locations to tuples for comparison, the corrected version of the function should now properly compare DataFrames and avoid the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
