### Issue Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue is related to the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. The problem can be identified when the function returns `True` even when the blocks have the same content but are located differently.

The root cause of this bug is that the `equals` function does not correctly handle a situation where the blocks are identical in content but have different locations, resulting in a False negative.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, we should compare them based on their content and not their location.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks) or set(self.blocks) != set(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_ordered_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.data)
    other_ordered_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.data)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_ordered_blocks, other_ordered_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now correctly compares the blocks based on their content and not their locations. This fix ensures that even if the blocks have different locations, they will be considered equal if their content matches, resolving the bug addressed in the GitHub issue.
