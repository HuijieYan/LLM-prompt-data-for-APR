### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their content, but the ordering is not considered. This leads to incorrect results as the blocks might be identical but at different indices due to prior operations.
2. The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with this problem as it mentions that the DataFrame `equals` method incorrectly returns true for blocks with identical content but different locations.
3. In the provided runtime case, the input values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are ordered differently, causing the bug to manifest.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the ordering of the blocks while comparing them. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks based on a canonical key that combines the type and location information.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a canonicalize function to sort blocks based on type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By implementing the `canonicalize` function to generate a consistent key for sorting, the corrected version of the function ensures that blocks are compared based on content and location, thus resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
