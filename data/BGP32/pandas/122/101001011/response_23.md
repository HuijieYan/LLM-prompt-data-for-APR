### Error Location
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is mistakenly implemented as a second `equals` method, causing a conflict and not adhering to the expected behavior of comparing blocks within a `BlockManager` instance.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The implementation of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class compares blocks within `self` and `other` instances. 
2. The block comparison is based on `canonicalize` function that sorts and compares blocks. 
3. The bug arises due to the sorting logic based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, where the comparison fails if blocks have identical values but different locations. 
4. The erroneous behavior leads to the incorrect evaluation of two block managers as equal when they are not identical in terms of block order.

### Fixing Strategy
To resolve the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include additional unique identifiers for better distinction between blocks.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider not only block attributes but also their composition or structure for a more accurate evaluation.
3. Ensure that the sorting mechanism in the comparison process avoids false positives where blocks with the same contents but different locations are mistakenly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), hash(tuple(block.values)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes a modification in the `canonicalize` function to incorporate a hash of the block's values in addition to `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This modification ensures that blocks are compared based on a more comprehensive set of attributes, allowing for a more precise equality evaluation between block managers.
