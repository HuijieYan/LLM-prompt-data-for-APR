### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by first comparing their axes, then consolidating them in-place, and finally comparing their blocks. The bug arises when the function incorrectly returns `True` even if the blocks have the same content but are located in different memory locations.

In the GitHub issue, the user expects `df3.equals(df4)` to return `False` since the data in the two DataFrames is different, but the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we should compare the content of the blocks instead of their memory locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include block content in the comparison. This way, even if the blocks are located in different memory locations, the function will correctly identify them as different.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering content and type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` function now considers the block content, memory location, and data type, ensuring the correct comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
