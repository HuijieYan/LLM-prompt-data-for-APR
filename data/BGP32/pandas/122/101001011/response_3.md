### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The issue described in the GitHub report specifically mentions that the `df3.equals(df4)` call returns `True` when it should be `False`. This indicates a problem with the logic in the `equals` function when comparing blocks with the same data but different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks without properly considering their locations, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Cause:
1. The first part of the function correctly checks if the axes of both `self` and `other` are the same.
2. However, when comparing the blocks, the code sorts them based on a canonicalization function that does not take into account the locations of the blocks.
3. This results in the comparison considering otherwise identical blocks with different locations as unequal, leading to a false comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks as well. This ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations will be considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the locations of the blocks in addition to their data type. This change should rectify the issue and ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal.
