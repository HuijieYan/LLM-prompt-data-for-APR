### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs when comparing blocks with identical data but different locations due to the sorting mechanism based on block properties, resulting in incorrect True returned even when the blocks should be distinct.

### Error Location
The bug originates from the sorting done on blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which considers the block datatype and their locations. This causes identical data blocks with different locations to be sorted inconsistently.

### Bug Cause
1. The function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which includes the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. 
2. For cases where blocks have identical data but different locations, the sorting based on locations causes the comparison to fail.
3. The issue is confirmed by the failing test case showing the function returning True when it should return False.
4. The inconsistent sorting leads to incorrect equality comparisons between blocks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function to consider only the block's `dtype.name` while ignoring the block locations. This change will ensure that identical data blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version removes the block locations from the sorting mechanism within the `equals` function, ensuring that only the `dtype.name` is considered for block equality comparisons.
