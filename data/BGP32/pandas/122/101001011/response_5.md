### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug appears to be related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The issue described on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False` due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely related to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The blocks are sorted based on the data type name and the `mgr_locs`, which can cause discrepancies when comparing blocks that are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not account for the fact that blocks with the same data but different locations should be considered equal during the comparison. This discrepancy leads to the incorrect result of the `equals` method.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic so that blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal. One way to achieve this is to enhance the `canonicalize` function to only consider the data type name (`dtype.name`) when sorting blocks, disregarding `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by only considering dtype name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` for sorting blocks, we ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal during the comparison. This change should address the bug reported on GitHub related to the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
