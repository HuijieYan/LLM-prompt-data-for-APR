### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The problem specifically arises when sorting the blocks based on their types and locations. The bug is due to the way the `canonicalize` function is defined. The `canonicalize` function should transform the block into a tuple consisting of the block's dtype name and the `mgr_locs` of the block. However, in the `canonicalize` function, `block.mgr_locs.as_array` is called, which should be `block.mgr_locs.as_indexer().tolist()` instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly construct the tuple for sorting blocks based on type and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_indexer().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this correction in the `canonicalize` function, the bug related to comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on blocks with different locations should be resolved.
