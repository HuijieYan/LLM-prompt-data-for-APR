### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have identical data but in different locations. This issue arises because the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when checking for equality. The sorting mechanism used in the function based on the block's `dtype` and `mgr_locs` does not ensure the correct comparison of blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to consider both the block's `dtype` and its `mgr_locs`. By incorporating both aspects into sorting the blocks, we can ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_indexer().tolist())  # Consider mgr_locs for sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs.get_indexer().tolist()` is used to incorporate the block's locations into the sorting mechanism. This change ensures that blocks are compared based on both data type and location, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
