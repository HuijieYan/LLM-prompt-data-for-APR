### Bug in the code:
The bug in the provided code is that the `canonicalize` function is using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to form a tuple, but the `as_array` method is called incorrectly. The correct way to call it is `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the call to the `as_array` method within the `canonicalize` function by adding parentheses to call the `as_array` method. This will ensure that the correct data is used to form the tuple.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By correcting the call to `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, this corrected version of the code should now correctly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the expected output of `False` for the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
