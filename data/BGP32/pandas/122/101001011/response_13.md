### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function attempts to sort the blocks by type name and then by location to compare them. However, the bug is triggered when two identical blocks have different locations. This results in the comparison returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the block canonicalization process so that it takes into account the equality of the blocks despite their locations. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks based on type name and contents rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Prepare blocks for comparison by converting to a list and removing the location dependency
    self_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist()) for block in other.blocks]
    
    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()
    
    # Check if the blocks are equal
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

By comparing the blocks based on their type names and contents rather than locations, the corrected version will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result.
