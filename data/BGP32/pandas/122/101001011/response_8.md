### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating the blocks in place, and then comparing the blocks. However, the bug lies in the comparison of blocks after sorting them based on a canonicalized key. The sorting is done based on the type name and the manager locations, but the comparison should also consider the actual data within the blocks.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug exists in the comparison process of the blocks after sorting them based on the canonicalized tuple. The comparison logic within the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the underlying data in the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` if the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just the type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that correctly compares the data in the blocks:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by checking the data inside them
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now correctly compares the blocks based on the data inside them.
- The type name and manager locations are no longer used for comparison.
- This change ensures that the function accurately determines equality based on the block data.

By implementing this correction, the function will now return the expected results for cases where identical blocks have different locations, resolving the bug stated in the GitHub issue.
