### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The comparison is done based on the axes and blocks of each `BlockManager`.
2. The function sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` based on a specific criterion before comparing them.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks have the same content but are located in different positions.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic after the blocks are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function. The comparison only considers the equality of blocks based on their sorted order, not taking into account the actual content of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to not only compare the sorted blocks but also verify the equality of content within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check content equality within blocks
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By incorporating the check for content equality within blocks in the corrected version, the function now correctly identifies when the `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks with different locations and returns the expected result.
