### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block locations. However, the bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect return of `True` when it should be `False`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function based on dtype name and block locations. If two identical blocks have different locations, they will be incorrectly considered unequal due to the sorting.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and block locations.
2. If identical blocks have different locations, they will be sorted differently.
3. As a result, the check for equality fails when comparing the sorted block lists between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for blocks in a way that considers identical blocks equal despite their different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modified the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for sorting the blocks. This change ensures that blocks with the same dtype are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly evaluate the equality of `BlockManager` instances even when they contain identical blocks with different locations.
