### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It compares the axes of both instances, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks inside `self` and `other`.
2. The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This sorting operation is triggering the bug, as it results in different blocks being considered equal due to the sorting order.
2. The function does not take into account the actual contents of the blocks while comparing for equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting operation based on block type and manager locations in the `canonicalize` function. Sorting the blocks in this way results in different block instances being considered equal due to the sorting order, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the equality comparison logic to directly compare the contents of the blocks without sorting them based on type and manager locations.
2. Ensure that blocks are compared based on their actual values rather than their positions in the sorted order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `equals` function removes the sorting operation on the blocks and directly compares the blocks for equality based on their actual content. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies differences in block contents and returns the expected result, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
