### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block types are equal.
- The bug arises when comparing blocks with different `mgr_locs` (locations), leading to incorrect True return value even if the blocks are not equal.

### Error Location:
- The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function, where it sorts blocks based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This sorting does not ensure correct comparison.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks should be solely based on block values, not on their memory locations or types. The sorting based on `mgr_locs` leads to misalignment of blocks while matching, hence incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, remove the `mgr_locs` component from the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function. It should focus only on sorting based on block types `(block.dtype.name)`.
- This modification will ensure that the comparison of blocks is independent of their internal locations, correcting the erroneous behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the consideration of block locations in sorting and comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that blocks are evaluated solely based on their values, fixing the erroneous True return issue reported in the GitHub bug.
