### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes lengths without considering the actual labels in each axis.
2. Sorting blocks based only on dtype name and mgr_locs.


### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first compares the lengths of the axes, then attempts to consolidate the blocks of both objects. After consolidation, it sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs and compares each block between the two `BlockManager` objects.

The bug arises because the function fails to consider the order of labels within each axis in the comparison. Additionally, sorting blocks based solely on dtype name and mgr_locs may not reflect the actual structure of the data within the blocks.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes checks for equality of labels and their order.
2. Improve the sorting of blocks to reflect the actual data structure within the blocks.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Ensure all labels in each axis are equal
    self_flat_index = [label for axis in self_axes for label in axis]
    other_flat_index = [label for axis in other_axes for label in axis]
    if self_flat_index != other_flat_index:
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Add label as a key in canonicalize function for better sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.mgr_locs.index.tolist(),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing both the axes' labels and the blocks' actual data structure, the corrected function should address the issue and pass the failing test.
