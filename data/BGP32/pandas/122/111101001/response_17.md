### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function first checks if the axes of two `BlockManager` instances are equal, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks within them. The issue lies in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, and then compares each block. However, when generating the tuple for sorting, it tries to access `block.dtype.name` directly, which should be accessed from `block` instead of `dtype`. This direct access leads to the error as observed from the input/output values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to correctly access the `dtype.name` attribute from the block itself. By updating the `canonicalize` function to access `block.dtype.name`, the comparison and sorting based on block attributes will work correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, passing the failing test case provided.
