### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks contained within the `BlockManager`. The function is sorting the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs` (which represents the index locations of the blocks), but the comparison is flawed. The bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `mgr_locs` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method. We should extract the index locations from `mgr_locs` properly and compare them. By fixing the comparison logic, the function will correctly determine the equality of the `BlockManager` objects by considering all aspects of the blocks.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to use the `values` attribute of the block instead of `mgr_locs`, the comparison will be based on the actual content of the blocks, ensuring a correct evaluation of equality between `BlockManager` objects.
