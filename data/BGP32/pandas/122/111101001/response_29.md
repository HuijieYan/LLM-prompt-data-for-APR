### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The order of blocks is critical in determining equality; however, during the sorting process of blocks, the `canonicalize` function creates a tuple using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The issue occurs because `mgr_locs` is an object of `BlockPlacement` and is not directly comparable, leading to incorrect sorting and subsequent equality checks.


### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs`. We should convert `mgr_locs` to a comparable format before creating the tuple to ensure correct sorting and comparison of blocks.


### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and location information
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_locs_as_array = np.array(list(block.mgr_locs))
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs_as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by converting the `mgr_locs` to a comparable format using `np.array(list(block.mgr_locs))` before creating the tuple inside the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared, resolving the issue with equality checks.
