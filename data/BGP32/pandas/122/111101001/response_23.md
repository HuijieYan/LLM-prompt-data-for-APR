### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in how the blocks are being compared for equality. The function sorts the blocks based on a tuple combining the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` attribute, which allows different blocks with the same data to be considered unequal due to their order in the sorting process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their actual data content rather than sorting them in an unpredictable order. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks and comparing them directly without sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if any(not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing each block's `equals` method in a loop, we ensure that the blocks are compared based on their data content rather than their order in the sorting process. This correction should address the issue and make the `equals` function behave correctly in comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
