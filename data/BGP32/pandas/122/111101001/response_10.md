### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises from misaligning the blocks in the two instances during comparison. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their types and locations, but when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`, the comparison iterates over the blocks without considering potential misalignment due to the sorting. This can lead to blocks being compared incorrectly and causing the function to return `False` even when the two `BlockManager` instances should be considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` maintains alignment during the iteration. One way to achieve this is to zip the sorted blocks of `self` and `other` based on the `canonicalize` function and compare the corresponding blocks directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing corresponding blocks in the sorted lists, we ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and maintain alignment between `self` and `other` during the comparison, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
