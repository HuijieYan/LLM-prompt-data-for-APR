The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two instances of the BlockManager class. The comparison logic should take into account the specific characteristics of each block, including the dtype and mgr_locs attributes, in order to determine equality correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to properly handle the block characteristics and modify the comparison logic to use these characteristics when comparing blocks between the two instances.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to properly handle block characteristics
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.shape, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly compare the block characteristics, ensuring the correct determination of equality between two instances of the BlockManager class.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
