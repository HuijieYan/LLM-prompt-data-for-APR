### Potential Error Location
The bug appears to be in the comparison block inside the `equals` function where it checks if each block in `self_blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other_blocks`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them. The issue seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting process is not properly accounting for the different dtype names and `mgr_locs` in the test case provided, leading to a false negative in the equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to take into consideration the actual dtype of the block being compared rather than just the dtype name. Additionally, the comparison logic should be updated to consider the order of the blocks as well. 

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to properly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test provided.
