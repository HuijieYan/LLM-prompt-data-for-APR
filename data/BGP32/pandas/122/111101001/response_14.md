### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function seems to be looping through blocks and checking if they are equal, but the problem arises when sorting the blocks and then comparing them.

The issue is that the `canonicalize` function is trying to access `mgr_locs` using `as_array.tolist()`, which is incorrect. The correct attribute access should be `mgr_locs.as_slice().tolist()` to correctly represent the block's location.

### Suggested Fix:
Update the `canonicalize` function's return statement to use `mgr_locs.as_slice().tolist()` instead of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the function should have the correct behavior and pass the failing test.
