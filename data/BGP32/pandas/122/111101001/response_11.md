The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks without considering the block type. The function tries to sort and compare blocks by type name and location, which can lead to incorrect results. Instead, we should compare blocks based on their content and dtype for accurate equality checks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than their type name and location. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if not all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    ):
        return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly by calling the `equals` method on each pair of blocks. With this correction, the function should now accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

After applying this fix, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
