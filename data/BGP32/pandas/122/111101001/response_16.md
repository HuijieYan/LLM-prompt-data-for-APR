### Issue:
The buggy function `equals` is returning `False` when comparing two BlockManager objects, even if the contents are equivalent. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

### Explanation:
1. The function compares the axes of both BlockManager objects `self` and `other` and ensures they have the same length.
2. It then iterates through the blocks of both objects, sorting and comparing them one by one.
3. However, the comparison method `equals` for the blocks might not be correctly implemented or may not handle certain types of blocks as expected. This could lead to incorrect comparisons and ultimately to the function returning `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects. We might need to revisit the implementation of the `equals` method for the block objects or consider updating the comparison logic inside the `equals` function of the BlockManager class.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare items and values instead of dtype names and mgr_locs, we create a more effective and accurate block comparison method. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
