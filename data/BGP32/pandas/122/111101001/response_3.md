The bug in the provided function is related to the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects `self` and `other`. The function tries to compare the blocks by sorting them based on their types (`dtype.name`) and locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`). However, the comparison logic is flawed, which results in the equals method returning incorrect results.

The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` is not equal to the number of axes in `other`, then it proceeds to consolidate the data in both `self` and `other`. After this step, it compares the number of blocks in `self` with the number of blocks in `other`. If they are unequal, the function returns False immediately. 

The main issue arises when trying to sort and compare the blocks based on their types and locations. The canonicalize function should use the type and location information to uniquely identify each block. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to correctly represent the properties of each block for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,
            block.mgr_locs.__repr__()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the canonicalize function to use the type name and mgr_locs representation for sorting, blocks will be uniquely identified and correctly compared during the equals operation.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the equals function should work properly for comparing BlockManager objects.
