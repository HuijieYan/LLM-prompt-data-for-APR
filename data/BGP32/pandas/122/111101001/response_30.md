### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the blocks are being compared. The function sorts the block lists (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) based on the type name and manager locations. However, it fails to consider that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is not directly comparable due to its nested structure. This causes incorrect equality comparison between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute. We can convert the `mgr_locs` to a tuple before comparing it, ensuring a proper comparison between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple within the `canonicalize` function, we ensure proper comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
