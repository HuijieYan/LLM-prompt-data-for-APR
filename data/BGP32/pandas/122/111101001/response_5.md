### Explanation:
The buggy function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. In this case, the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with columns `"a"` and `"b"`, but with mismatched data types between the columns.

The buggy function fails to correctly compare the blocks due to the sorting mechanism used. It sorts the blocks based on a combination of the data type name and the block's locations. However, the sorting logic does not account for the data type difference between columns, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. When sorting, it does not consider the data types of the blocks, resulting in incorrect comparison outcomes.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type information while sorting the blocks. This modification will ensure that blocks are correctly sorted based on both the data type and block location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Updated canonicalize function to include data type
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the blocks along with the block's location, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now be able to compare `BlockManager` instances correctly, passing the failing test scenario.
