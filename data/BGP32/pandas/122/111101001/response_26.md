### Explanation:
The `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug in the function arises from the way it compares the blocks stored within the `BlockManager` instances. The function should compare the content and structure of the blocks, but due to a sorting issue, the comparison fails when the order of blocks is different between the two `BlockManager` instances.

In the failing test case provided, the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have columns in a different order. When these DataFrames are converted to `BlockManager` objects using the `equals()` method, the comparison fails because the order of the blocks is not handled correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals()` method, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is done in a consistent way regardless of the order of blocks. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the content and structure, rather than ordering by block type name and location. This will ensure that the comparison is not dependent on the order of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content and structure
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this fix, re-run the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to ensure that the corrected version passes the test.
