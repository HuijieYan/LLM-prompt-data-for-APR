### Analyze the buggy function

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their internal attributes. The function is structured to compare the axes, consolidate the blocks, and then compare the blocks in a canonicalized order.

### Identifying the bug

Based on the runtime values provided, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks. The canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function doesn't consider the actual contents of the blocks but only the type and positions of the blocks. This might lead to a false negative in cases where the contents of the blocks are different, even though their types and positions are the same.

### Bug fix strategy

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data in the blocks for comparison. This way, we ensure that the equality check of blocks is based on both their type and content.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by considering block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block values in the comparison, we ensure that the `equals` function takes into account the actual contents of the blocks for equality verification. This correction should make the function pass the failing test provided.
