### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks in a non-canonical order, leading to incorrect results when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the block's data type and location in memory. If the blocks are not sorted correctly, the equality check will fail, even if the underlying data is the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects are sorted in a consistent order before performing the equality check. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data type and position in memory consistently. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks consistently based on data type and block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consistently sorting the blocks based on data type and location, the corrected `equals` function will successfully compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality, passing the failing test case.
