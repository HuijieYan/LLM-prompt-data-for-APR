### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function tries to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the comparison logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect results. The bug lies in the way the blocks are compared. The function first sorts the blocks based on the data type name and location, but fails to consider the asymmetric nature of the block comparison. For example, in the failing test case, the order of columns in the DataFrames of `self` and `other` is reversed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle the order of blocks in `self` and `other`. We can achieve this by iterating over all blocks in each `BlockManager` and comparing them based on their content, rather than relying solely on sorting. Additionally, we should ensure that the content of the blocks is correctly compared, taking into account the columns and their respective positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks based on content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

By iterating over the blocks directly and comparing their content, we address the issue of block order mismatch and ensure a correct comparison of the `BlockManager` objects. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
