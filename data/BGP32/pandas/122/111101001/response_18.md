### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function attempts to compare the blocks based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`, but due to an issue in canonicalizing the blocks, the comparison fails even when the actual data within the blocks is equivalent. This results in the function returning `False`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the blocks based on their content rather than their metadata. This can be achieved by directly comparing the values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.get_values_hash())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.get_values_hash())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:
In the corrected version, we use a `get_values_hash()` method (hypothetical method) on each block to derive a hash value based on the actual data contents of the block. This allows us to canonically compare the blocks by their content rather than relying on their metadata. The corrected version ensures that equivalent blocks will be considered equal even if their location or dtype differs.
