### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to not properly handling the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which uses the dtype name and the manager locations to create a tuple for comparison. However, the comparison may fail if the manager locations are not properly converted to a list during this process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is correctly converted to a list before creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By converting `block.mgr_locs.as_array` to a list before creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly, fixing the bug.
