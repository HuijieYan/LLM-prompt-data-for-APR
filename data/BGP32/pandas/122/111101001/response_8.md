### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing blocks from two `BlockManager` objects. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function, where a comparison is being made using `.as_array.tolist()`. The problem is that the `as_array` method returns a NumPy array, but calling `tolist()` on it results in a list of lists, which is not comparable with the expected tuple format.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly build the tuple for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly constructs the tuple with the block type name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring a valid comparison.
