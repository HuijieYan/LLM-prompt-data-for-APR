### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue occurs because the `block` and `oblock` variables are extracted incorrectly from the sorted blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons. The comparison is based on the tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`, but `mgr_locs` is being accessed incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct how `mgr_locs` is accessed and converted to a list within the `canonicalize` function. Once this is resolved, the comparisons between the sorted blocks should be accurate.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correctly accessing the `indexer` from `mgr_locs` and converting it to a list in the `canonicalize` function, the comparisons between blocks will be based on valid information, fixing the bug.
