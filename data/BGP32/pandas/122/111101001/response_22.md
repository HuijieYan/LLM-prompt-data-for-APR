### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of blocks within the two instances. In the buggy function, the blocks are sorted based on a canonicalization function before performing the equality check. The bug arises from the incorrect implementation of the canonicalization function, which leads to incorrect sorting of blocks for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not correctly handling the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list. The buggy line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be replaced with `list(block.mgr_locs)`. This error causes the sorting to be inaccurate, leading to failures in equality checks between two instances of the `BlockManager` class.

### Fix:
Modify the `canonicalize` function's line to correctly convert `mgr_locs` to a list before sorting the blocks. Replace:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```
with
```python
return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
