### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks in an incorrect order. The function is sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function that includes the block's dtype name and manager locations. However, the comparison is being done based on the sorted blocks, which may not be in the correct order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` is based on the original order of the blocks, not the sorted order. We can achieve this by directly iterating over the blocks of `self` and `other`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares blocks from `self` and `other` in their original order, ensuring a correct comparison.
