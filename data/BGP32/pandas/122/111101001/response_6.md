### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from misaligning the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the number of axes and their equality match in `self` and `other` instances correctly. However, when comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`, the function does not consider the correct order or indexing of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self` and `other` instances are correctly aligned before comparing them. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their type names and locations within the manager (`mgr_locs`). This will allow us to compare corresponding blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on type names and locations before comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances.
