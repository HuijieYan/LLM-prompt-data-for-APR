### Bug Fix Explanation:
The issue with the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks in a particular order, which can lead to the function erroneously returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on dtype and locations is not effective in distinguishing blocks that are actually different.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to sort the blocks in a more comprehensive way that considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their dtype and locations. One approach could be to sort the blocks based on their content to ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on actual content and then compare
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return [tuple(block.values.tolist()) for block in blocks]
    
    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(block == oblock for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now compare DataFrames based on the actual content of their blocks, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations will correctly return `False` when compared.
