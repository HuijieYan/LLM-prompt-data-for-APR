## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then compares each block within them.
2. The bug seems to arise from a discrepancy in block locations between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, causing the `equals` function to return inaccurate results.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this bug by creating two DataFrames with identical data but different column order, which should result in `equals` returning `False`, but due to the block locations difference, it returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects are correctly compared. Sorting the blocks based on block characteristics before comparison can help in achieving this.
5. The corrected version of the function will compare the blocks after sorting them based on block characteristics to ensure accurate equality checks.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on block characteristics for accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their characteristics before comparison, the corrected function should now accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
