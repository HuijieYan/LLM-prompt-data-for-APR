### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The function checks the equality of axes and then proceeds to compare the blocks, but the comparison logic for blocks is flawed.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the `equals` function to return `False` for two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This is not the case with the current implementation of the function.
4. The bug arises when sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, leading to a comparison that is not based on the actual block data.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function to compare the actual block content rather than sorting them based on `canonicalize` function.
2. Ensure that the correct comparison is made between the blocks during the equality check.
3. Consider the block data, not just the dtype and mgr_locs, when comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on their locations before comparing them for equality, ensuring a proper comparison of the block contents.
