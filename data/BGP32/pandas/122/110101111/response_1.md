The issue in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the blocks. In the buggy implementation, the comparison of blocks is done based on the dtype name and mgr_locs, which may not uniquely identify the blocks, leading to incorrect equality check. 

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their contents. We can use the `equals` method of the blocks themselves for a more accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks using their `equals` method, ensuring a more accurate check for equality.

The corrected version should pass the failing test provided in the GitHub issue and return `False` as expected.
