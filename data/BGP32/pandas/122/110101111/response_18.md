### Bug Explanation:

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks within the object. The bug arises from the sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the blocks. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which can be inconsistent if the blocks are unconsolidated.

The bug causes the `equals` function to return incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to update the sorting mechanism within the `equals` function to address the inconsistency caused by unconsolidated blocks. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both dtype and data values for a more accurate comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including dtype values for consistency
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering both dtype values and block locations in the sorting mechanism, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the expected results for the failing test case.
