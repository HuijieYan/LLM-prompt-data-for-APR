### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is due to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The function sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, potentially causing identical blocks to be considered different due to differing `mgr_locs`. This behavior leads to incorrect equality evaluations, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for the blocks to ensure that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations. One approach is to sort the blocks based solely on their data content, such as the values they hold, rather than on their internal `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()  # Sort based on values, ignores locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values in the corrected function above, identical blocks will be considered equal regardless of their locations, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
