### Bug Explanation:
The `BlockManager.equals()` function is implemented to check the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the current implementation mistakenly compares the `BlockManager` blocks using the `block.mgr_locs.as_array` property, which can result in incorrect comparisons if the blocks have the same content but different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their memory locations. One way to achieve this is by comparing the blocks directly using their `values` attribute, where the actual data is stored.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks' values in the corrected version, we ensure that the equality check considers the actual data within the blocks rather than their memory locations. This update should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
