The bug in the `equals` function is related to how blocks are compared. The function fails to return the correct result when there are identical blocks in different locations. The comparison logic of the function needs to be adjusted to address this issue.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle identical blocks in different locations correctly.
2. Use a more robust method to compare the blocks, considering both the type name and the locations of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `equals` function compares the blocks correctly, taking into account their type names and locations. It should now return the expected output for the failing test provided.
