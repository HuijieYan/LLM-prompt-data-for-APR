The bug in the `equals()` function arises from comparing blocks with identical data but different locations incorrectly. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks instead of just their positions. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize()` function to compare the actual contents of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by comparing the block values directly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.to_numpy().tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values of the blocks directly in the `canonicalize()` function, we ensure that the equality check is based on the actual data rather than their positions, fixing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.

After applying this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should now pass as expected.

Please verify the corrected version with the failing test and the expected inputs/outputs to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed.
