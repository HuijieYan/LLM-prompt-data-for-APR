### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks using the `block.equals(oblock)` code. The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method may lead to incorrect results due to unconsolidated blocks with the same type but different locations. This results in scenarios where identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, leading to unexpected behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying solely on the `equals` method of the blocks, we should check for both block type equivalence and the equality of their content or values. This way, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not being incorrectly flagged as equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are using the block type name and the block object itself for canonicalization instead of relying on just the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal solely based on their type and location.

By implementing this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle scenarios where same-type blocks with different locations are compared, resolving the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
