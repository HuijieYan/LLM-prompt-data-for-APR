### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.
2. The function first checks if the axes lengths of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
3. It then iterates over the axes of each `BlockManager` instance to check if they are equal.
4. The function consolidates both `BlockManager` instances in place.
5. After consolidation, the function compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager` instance.
6. Next, it sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.
7. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks and checks if each block equals the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager` instance.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` even in cases where the two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks but with different locations. The issue arises due to the comparison based on block types and locations failing to identify the difference in block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider not only the block types and dtype names but also the block locations to ensure accurate equality evaluation between the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the comparison criteria, the corrected function will now accurately determine the equality of the `BlockManager` instances.
