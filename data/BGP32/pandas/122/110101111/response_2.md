The issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is incorrectly identifying DataFrame blocks as equal when they are not due to the sorting process. The issue is related to block order canonicalization leading to incorrect equality checks.

To address this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to properly generate a key for block comparison. The modification involves considering the data as part of the comparison key, ensuring that blocks with the same values but different locations are not mistakenly marked as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and the data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where DataFrame blocks have identical values but different locations as not being equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
