### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` expecting them to be unequal, but currently, the equals method is incorrectly evaluating them as equal.
3. The buggy function first compares the axes of the two objects and then attempts to compare individual blocks for equality using a sorting mechanism based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises when comparing blocks due to different block locations even though the blocks themselves might be equal.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only the content of the blocks is compared, rather than the block locations.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Modify the function to compare block content instead of block locations.
2. Keeping the existing axis comparison intact.
3. Adjust the key for sorting to ensure that blocks are being compared solely based on their content.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not location
    def content_key(block):
        return block.get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=content_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=content_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing blocks based on content and not location, the function should now correctly identify when two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.
