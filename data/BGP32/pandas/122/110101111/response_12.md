### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects to determine equality.
- The bug arises when checking the equality of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations, but this can lead to incorrect results if the blocks have identical data but different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` are created with columns 'a' and 'b' having values of different types in a different column order.
- The `equals` function fails to distinguish the blocks correctly due to the sorting based on type name and location, resulting in an incorrect equality comparison.
- The expected outcome for `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but the function may incorrectly return `True` due to the issue with block comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared for equality. Instead of relying on sorting by type name and location, we should compare the actual values in the blocks.
- We can iterate over the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and compare the values within each block to ensure equality.
- We may need to modify the comparison logic based on the specific properties of the blocks (e.g., data type, shape, values) to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

### Note:
- The corrected version modifies the comparison logic to iterate over the blocks and compare them directly by calling the `equals` method of each block.
- This approach ensures that the actual block values are compared for equality, resolving the bug in the `equals` function.
