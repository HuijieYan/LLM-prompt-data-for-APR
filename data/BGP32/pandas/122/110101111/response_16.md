## Bug Analysis
### Issue:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior and leads to failing tests, as demonstrated in the test case provided.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function correctly checks the equality of axes but fails to consider the location of the blocks when comparing them. This causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks are in different locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `equals` function is comparing blocks solely based on their content and not their actual positions within the `BlockManager`. As a result, the function incorrectly concludes that two `BlockManager` instances with differently located but identical blocks are equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to account for the location of the blocks when determining equality. By taking into consideration both the content and position of the blocks, the function can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now considers the `mgr_locs` (block locations) in the `canonicalize` function. By sorting the blocks based on a combination of their type name and locations, the function is able to accurately compare the blocks within different `BlockManager` instances and return the correct equality result.
