### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The issue arises when comparing DataFrames using the `equals` function, as seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
3. At runtime, the function is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue occurs when the function incorrectly returns True when blocks have identical data but different locations.
4. The bug stems from the sorting mechanism using `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type and location for comparison. If the location differs due to unconsolidated blocks, the comparison may fail.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to focus on block content rather than location.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the content of blocks instead of sorting by location, this fix ensures that DataFrames with identical data but different block locations are correctly identified as not equal.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected during DataFrame comparisons.
