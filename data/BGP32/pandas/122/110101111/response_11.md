The bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it is comparing blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing `BlockManager` objects whose blocks have identical data but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks so that it considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just their order or locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks have identical data
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By using `np.array_equal` to compare the values within the blocks, we ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the `BlockManager` objects have identical data.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
