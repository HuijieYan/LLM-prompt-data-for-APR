In the given buggy `equals` function, the issue is that the comparison of blocks is based on the order of blocks rather than their content. This leads to a false positive result if the order of the blocks differs but the content is the same. To address this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison considers both order and content of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values_hash)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values_hash)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, after consolidating inplace, we sort the blocks based on `values_hash` which should ensure a proper comparison considering both the order and content of the blocks.

By applying this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct comparison result, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
