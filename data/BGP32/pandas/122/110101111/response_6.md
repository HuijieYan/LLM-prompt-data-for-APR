The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The current implementation incorrectly considers blocks with different locations as equal. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.nbytes, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the modified version, we first check if the axes are not equal, and then proceed to compare the blocks. The `canonicalize` function now takes into account the block's data, ensuring that even blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided and correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
