### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances using their axes and blocks. The issue arises when sorting the `blocks` list to ensure order consistency. The sorting is based on a tuple combining the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This method can lead to incorrect comparisons when blocks with the same dtype name have different `mgr_locs`, resulting in `equals` incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider `mgr_locs` while sorting the blocks. By including `mgr_locs` in the tuple for comparison, we can ensure that blocks with the same dtype name but different `mgr_locs` are not mistakenly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` in the comparison tuple, we can ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted based on both dtype name and `mgr_locs` to avoid the issue of incorrectly identifying blocks as equal.
