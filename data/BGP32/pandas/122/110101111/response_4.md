### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances due to inconsistent block locations. The function is comparing the blocks using a sorting criteria that includes the block's data type and manager locations. However, when the block locations are different, the comparison fails even if the block content is the same.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `equals` first compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, which seems correct.
2. Then it iterates over the blocks in the two instances and sorts them based on a canonicalization function that includes the block's data type and manager locations.
3. If the block locations are different, even if the block content is identical, the comparison will fail because the sorting based on manager locations will cause mismatches.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the data within the blocks regardless of their location. One possible solution is to sort the blocks based on the data itself, disregarding the manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(str(x.values)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(str(x.values)))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content. This change will allow the function to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances irrespective of the block locations.
