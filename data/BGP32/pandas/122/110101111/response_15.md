The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of `BlockManager` objects containing blocks that may have identical values but are located in different locations. The comparison should consider the block locations for correctness.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the block content along with their locations. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs and block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version now includes a check to compare the block locations `mgr_locs` along with the block content using the `equals` method.

This modification addresses the issue outlined in the GitHub report and ensures that the `equals` function correctly handles cases where blocks have identical values but different locations. It should pass the failing test provided.
