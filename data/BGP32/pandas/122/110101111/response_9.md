The bug in the `equals` function is caused by comparing blocks based solely on their order, leading to wrong results when blocks have equal elements but different locations. To fix this bug, we should compare blocks based on their content rather than their position.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_key(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their values by defining a `get_block_key` function to extract the block values. Sorting blocks before comparison ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly handled. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the `equals` function returns the correct result for DataFrame equality comparison.
