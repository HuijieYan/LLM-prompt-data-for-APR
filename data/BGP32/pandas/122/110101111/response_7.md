The issue in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is related to comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug occurs when checking the equality of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Error Location:
1. The function compares the blocks without considering their order, which can lead to incorrect results depending on the block order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from comparing blocks in different orders, resulting in the function incorrectly identifying differing blocks as the same.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in a consistent and uniform order to accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order for consistent comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them, ensuring a consistent order for comparison.

By implementing this change, the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where the blocks are in different orders as being unequal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
