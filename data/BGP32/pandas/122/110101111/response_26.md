### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two instances of the class are equal based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to stem from how the blocks are compared, specifically in the sorting logic to canonicalize the blocks.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function. The sorting should compare `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for each block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function doesn't correctly handle the tuple construction for sorting the blocks. This causes blocks with identical data but different locations to be considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the tuple.
2. Ensure that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are properly sorted based on this modified `canonicalize` function.
3. Finally, compare the sorted blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the canonicalization to include mgr_locs for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of blocks based on their data type and location, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
