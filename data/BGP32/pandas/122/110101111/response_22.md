### Issue Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns swapped and asserts that they should not be equal, but the current implementation returns True incorrectly.
- The issue on GitHub reports a similar case where the expected output was False, but the function returned True for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function compares the blocks based on their types and locations, but it does not consider the actual values within the blocks.
- The sorting of blocks without considering the values causes the function to return True even for blocks with different values but similar type and location.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of just their type and location.
- Update the sorting mechanism for blocks to consider the values for proper equality comparison.
- Ensure that the function only returns True if the axes and the block values are exactly the same for both instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Conclusion:
- The corrected function now compares the block values and locations properly for equality, ensuring that the function returns the correct result based on the block contents.
- This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
