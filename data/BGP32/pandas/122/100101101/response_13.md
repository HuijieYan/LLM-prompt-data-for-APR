### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize`. The issue occurs because the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, where `block.dtype.name` is a string representing the data type. When comparing two different data types (like 'int64' and 'object'), the sorting based on data type and location results in a false negative in the `equals` check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the manager locations for sorting. This change ensures that the comparison logic focuses on the block's locations and not the data type, preventing false negatives in the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on mgr_locs for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider block locations, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly compare the BlockManagers for equality based on the manager locations. This change prevents the false negative that occurred due to data type sorting in the previous implementation.
