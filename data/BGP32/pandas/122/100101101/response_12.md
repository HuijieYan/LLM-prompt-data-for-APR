### Bug Explanation:
The `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function is sorting the blocks based on the dtype.name and mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() attributes. However, in the failing test case provided, the DataFrame columns are of different types, which causes the comparison to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type (e.g., IntBlock, ObjectBlock) along with the dtype.name and mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(). This way, blocks with different types will not be considered equal during the sorting process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that blocks with different types are not considered equal during the sorting process, addressing the issues with the failing test case.
