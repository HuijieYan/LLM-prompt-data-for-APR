### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are the same, and then proceeds to sort and compare the blocks within each object. However, the bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects. The comparison method used does not properly handle the comparison of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects is done correctly. We should compare the blocks directly using the `equals()` method available for each type of block (IntBlock and ObjectBlock). 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) 
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects using the `equals()` method specific to each block type, the corrected function should now provide the correct comparison results and pass the failing test.
