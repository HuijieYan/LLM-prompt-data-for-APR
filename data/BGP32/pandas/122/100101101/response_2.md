### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is missing the information about the block type, causing blocks of different types but with the same dtype name to be incorrectly compared.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and the type of block. This modification will ensure that blocks are sorted and compared correctly based on both dtype name and block type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Revised canonicalize function to include block type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block type in the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now compare blocks correctly and pass the failing test case.
