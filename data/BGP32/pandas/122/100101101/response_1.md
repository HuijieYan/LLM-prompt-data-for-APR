The bug in the provided function lies in the canonicalize function's usage within the sorted method. The variables block and oblock in the zip operation are not correctly unpacked due to how the blocks are being passed in. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to unpack the blocks correctly and compare them as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block[0].dtype.name, block[1].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, block_loc) for block, block_loc in self.blocks.items()], key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, block_loc) for block, block_loc in other.blocks.items()], key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, block_loc), (oblock, oblock_loc) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version correctly unpacks the blocks and their corresponding locations before sorting and comparing them, ensuring the comparison is done on the expected values.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
