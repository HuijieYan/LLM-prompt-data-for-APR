### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it compares two `BlockManager` instances. The function first checks if the number of axes and their equality between the two `BlockManager` instances, then it sorts the blocks within each manager based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, and finally checks if the blocks are equal. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager`, specifically in the sorting mechanism.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the sorting mechanism of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple containing `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of a block, but it compares `mgr_locs` as a list incorrectly, leading to the incorrect comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism should be modified to correctly compare the `mgr_locs` attribute of blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the `BlockManager` blocks should be checked appropriately to ensure the equality of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the `BlockManager` blocks correctly based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, ensuring a proper comparison and fixing the bug.
