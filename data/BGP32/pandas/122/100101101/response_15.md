### Error:
The buggy function is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic is flawed and does not consider all possible block types or their contents.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `equals` is not handling the comparison of blocks properly. The function is using a sorting mechanism based on block type and location, but it does not consider the contents of the blocks during the comparison. This leads to incorrect results when comparing `BlockManager` objects with different block types or block contents.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider all block types and their contents during the comparison. We should iterate through each block in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects and compare them properly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):  # Compare contents of each block
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now properly compares the contents of each block in the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring a correct comparison result.
