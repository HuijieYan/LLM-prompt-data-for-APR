### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, in the failing test case provided, the data types of the columns in `df1` and `df2` are different (`int64` vs. `object`), resulting in a false negative comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the block as well. This modification will ensure that the equality comparison considers both the data type and the `mgr_locs` of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, dtype, and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, type(block)) + tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data type and type, we ensure that the comparison takes into account all relevant attributes, which should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
