### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, where each block is sorted with a key function `canonicalize`. The issue occurs due to incorrect sorting of blocks leading to false comparisons.

In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types. The comparison in the `equals` function tries to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name`, leading to incorrect ordering of blocks and subsequent false inequality detection.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting key function `canonicalize` to consider both the data type and column name of the blocks. By combining `dtype.name` and column name in the sorting key, we can ensure that blocks are sorted correctly and the comparison results are accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype) + block.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Consider both dtype and block name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By adjusting the `canonicalize` function to create a sorting key that combines both data type and column name, we ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly, enabling accurate comparison and resolving the bug.
