### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the block types. The comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` assumes that both contain the same block types in the same order, which is not guaranteed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on both the block type and the manager locations. This will ensure that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is accurate even if the block types are not in the same order.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the implementation above, the `equals` function will correctly sort the blocks based on block type and manager locations, ensuring a successful comparison.
