### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. In the failing test, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns of different data types (`int` and `object`) which leads to incorrect comparison due to sorting based on data types. This sorting mismatch causes the `equals` function to return False incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type and the column name for sorting blocks. This adjustment will ensure that DataFrames with columns of different data types can be correctly compared.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order considering both data type and column name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both data type and column name, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test without incorrectly returning False.
