### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other`. The sorting is based on a function `canonicalize` that combines the datatype name and `mgr_locs` of the block. However, in the failing test case, the `df1` and `df2` `DataFrames` have mismatched values in columns 'a' and 'b', which results in datatype conflict in the `BlockManager` blocks. The sorting of blocks based on datatype causes the comparison to fail incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it only considers the datatype of the block for sorting. This way, the sorting will be consistent, even if there are mixed datatypes in the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on data type only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By only considering the datatype for sorting the blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
