### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function used to order the blocks before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function is not handling the `str` type correctly. It treats all blocks as if they have the `dtype.name` attribute. This causes an issue when comparing blocks with different data types.

In the failing test provided, the `df1` DataFrame has data of type `int` and `string`, while the `df2` DataFrame has the data types reversed. The bug in the `equals` function causes it to treat all blocks as having the same data type (`dtype.name` attribute), leading to a false positive equality result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle different data types. We can create a new canonicalization tuple combining the block type and data inside the block, rather than just relying on the `dtype.name` attribute. This way, we can ensure that blocks with different data types will be correctly compared.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize block order to consider block type and contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block.values, pd.IntBlock):  # check for IntBlock type
            return (pd.IntBlock, block.values.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block.values, pd.FloatBlock):  # check for FloatBlock type
            return (pd.FloatBlock, block.values.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block.values, pd.ObjectBlock):  # check for ObjectBlock type
            return (pd.ObjectBlock, block.values.as_array.tolist())
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block type and the block contents, we ensure that the comparison between blocks will be accurate, regardless of the data types within the blocks. This corrected version should pass the failing test for DataFrame inequality.
