### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how the blocks are being sorted and compared between two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug causes the function to return `False` incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` instances that have the same data but in different block order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly without considering the order of the blocks while matching them.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, length, and then dtype, to ensure consistent ordering for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, len(block), block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By utilizing a `canonicalize` function that creates a consistent tuple for each block based on block details, such as type, length, and dtype, we ensure that the ordering of blocks does not affect the comparison result. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
