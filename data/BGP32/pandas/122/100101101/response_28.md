### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManagers for equality based on various conditions. The bug seems to arise from the sorting of blocks within the BlockManagers. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is faulty due to the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function.

In the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the expected behavior is that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` since the data in the dataframes `df1` and `df2` is swapped for columns 'a' and 'b'. However, the buggy function is not handling this case as expected, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to revise the sorting mechanism based on unique identifiers that will properly distinguish blocks even if they are in different positions within the BlockManager.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a unique identifier for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `id` function as a unique identifier for each block in the `canonicalize` function for sorting, we remove the dependency on block types or order within the BlockManager, ensuring proper comparison for equality.
