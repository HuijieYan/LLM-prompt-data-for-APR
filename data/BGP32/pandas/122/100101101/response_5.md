### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates the blocks within each instance and compares the blocks for equality based on their data types and locations.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with swapped column values, which should return `False` when compared for equality by the `equals` function. However, due to the sorting mechanism used within the function, it fails to correctly identify the inequality between the DataFrames.

Specifically, the function sorts the blocks by a canonicalization function that combines the data type name and the manager locations of each block. Since the blocks from the different DataFrames do not match in terms of data type or location, the sorting and subsequent comparison fail to accurately determine equality.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to accurately verify the equality of the DataFrames. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on data type and location, we should directly compare the blocks in the original order they appear in the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the original order, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately identify the inequality between the DataFrames and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
