### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done in a consistent and accurate way. One approach is to compare the blocks directly without relying on sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the function compares the blocks directly without relying on sorting. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
