### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function calculates a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`, but the `dtype.name` of a block is used without checking if it's applicable to all block types.

In the provided failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have different data types in their columns, causing the equality check in the `equals` function to return `False` when it should actually handle and compare different data types in a more appropriate manner.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the possibility of different data types in blocks. One way to address this is to include the data type of the actual block in the tuple for comparison. This can ensure that blocks with different data types are not incorrectly seen as unequal during the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's type name along with its data type, ensuring that blocks with different data types are properly handled and compared for equality. This modification should now allow the function to pass the failing test and accurately compare DataFrame objects with different data types.
