### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager`. The function compares the blocks based on the order in which they are sorted by the `canonicalize` function. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle the comparison of different block types (e.g., `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type along with the block locations in the comparison. This modification will ensure that the blocks are distinguished correctly based on both type and location.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block type along with the block locations in the comparison, ensuring that different block types are properly distinguished. This fix should make the `equals` function work correctly with the failing test case provided.
