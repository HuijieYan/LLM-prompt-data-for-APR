### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the use of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables sorted and compared based on a custom sorting key function `canonicalize`. The sorting key consists of the data type name and the manager locations, which can lead to inconsistent behavior when comparing certain block types.

In the provided example, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different types but in the opposite order. When comparing these DataFrames with the `equals` function, the function incorrectly returns `True` due to the wrong comparison based on the custom sorting key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to avoid sorting the blocks based on a custom sorting key to prevent inconsistent behavior. Instead, we can directly compare each block in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without the custom sorting key, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly return `False` when comparing DataFrames with columns of different types in different order, passing the failing test case.
