### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, the current implementation is not handling the comparison properly, resulting in a false negative for the test.

The main issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks for comparison. The `canonicalize` function constructs a tuple using the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` of the block. In the failing test case, the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` have mixed up values in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function considers the correct order for the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` within the `BlockManager` instances. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple based on the block type and the position of the block within the blocks list. This will ensure consistent comparison and correct identification of equal `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, idx):
        return (type(block).__name__, idx)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block, idx: canonicalize(block, idx))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block, idx: canonicalize(block, idx))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of `BlockManager` instances should now consider the block type and position within the blocks list, leading to accurate equality checks. This corrected version should pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
