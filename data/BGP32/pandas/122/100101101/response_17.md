### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables, which are sorted lists of blocks from two different `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is intended to check if each block in `self_blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. However, the sorting mechanism used to order the blocks might not be consistent or meaningful in all cases, leading to incorrect results when comparing blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done accurately without relying on any arbitrary sorting. One potential strategy is to iterate over each block in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples directly and compare them based on their index, which ensures a one-to-one comparison between blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks directly and comparing them based on their index, we ensure an accurate comparison between blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects, ultimately fixing the bug and making the `equals` function behave as expected.
