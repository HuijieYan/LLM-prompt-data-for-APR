### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely arising due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a function `canonicalize` that should compare blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The issue is that `mgr_locs` is being accessed incorrectly as an attribute of `block`. The correct way to access it should be `block.mgr_locs`. This leads to incorrect comparison, causing the function to return `False` erroneously.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to extract `mgr_locs` correctly by accessing it via `block.mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Update the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` accordingly to use the corrected `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
