### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the way the `canonicalize` function is implemented. The `canonicalize` function uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of `block` to create a tuple for sorting, but the `mgr_locs` attribute is not included in the expected values during the failing test execution. This discrepancy causes the incorrect comparison between `block`s in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, leading to the function returning an incorrect result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function and the sorting process are based on attributes that are consistent with the expected values during the failing test execution. In this case, we should remove the reliance on `mgr_locs` and instead focus on attributes that are reflected in the expected values, such as the block's data type (`dtype`). By using the block's data type in the sorting process, we can make the comparison more accurate and correct.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the revised `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on their data type (`dtype.name`), the corrected `equals` function should now produce the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
