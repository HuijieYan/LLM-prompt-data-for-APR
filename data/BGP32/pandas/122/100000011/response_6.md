### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas is used to compare two data structures, but it fails to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations. This bug results in the `equals` function returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in the two DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks, but it does not consider the block locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function only considers the data type name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to identify blocks. This tuple combination may not be unique for blocks with the same data but different locations, causing the function to mistakenly return `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information as well. By considering the block's data, data type, and location, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as distinct.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, data, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's data values in addition to its data type name and location. This modification ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly differentiated during comparison.
