### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is supposed to compare two DataFrames for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are equal. The bug reported in the GitHub issue suggests that the function wrongly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `canonicalize()` function where blocks are sorted based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This method may not capture differences in locations correctly.
2. The comparison using `equals()` at the end might not be able to handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the sorting approach used to compare blocks in the `canonicalize()` function. It only considers the block's type and locations, and not the actual content. Therefore, when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, the function incorrectly returns True because the block content comparison is not taken into account.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the comparison strategy to consider both block type, location, and content. This can be achieved by generating a unique hash combining all these characteristics for each block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def hash_block(block):
        return hash((block.values, block.index, block.columns))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=hash_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=hash_block)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I introduced a new `hash_block()` function that generates a hash based on block content, index, and columns. This hash is then used to sort and compare the blocks in a way that considers both the block's content and metadata. This modification should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and improve the accuracy of the `equals()` function.
