### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two pandas DataFrames for equality. The bug described in the GitHub issue is that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, whereas it should return `False`. The issue arises when identical blocks are in different locations within the DataFrames.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `sorted` function on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` could potentially disturb the comparison due to blocks with similar content but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic of comparing blocks in the `equals` function does not take into account the scenario where data blocks are identical but in different locations. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparison, which does not guarantee a correct comparison for identical blocks with different locations.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function should be modified to directly check for equality without sorting the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as different during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison is done directly without sorting the blocks. This change ensures that identical blocks in different locations will be correctly identified as different, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
