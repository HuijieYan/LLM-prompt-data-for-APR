### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `managers.py` file of pandas is not properly comparing the blocks in the DataFrame leading to incorrect results. This issue was reported on GitHub where the user expected the function to return False for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize()` function is used to define the key for sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. If identical blocks are present in different locations, the current sorting mechanism may not handle it correctly.
2. The comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` may not be effective when dealing with identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `equals()` function does not properly handle cases where identical blocks exist in DataFrames but are located in different positions. This leads to incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to account for identical blocks with different locations. We may need to consider additional factors for comparison or adjust the sorting mechanism to handle such cases effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks based on dtype, values, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # check equality for each block
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now accounts for block values as well as dtype and mgr_locs. This enables a more accurate sorting of blocks for comparison. The comparison is done by iterating through each pair of blocks and checking for equality.

By making these adjustments, the `equals()` function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks exist in different locations within DataFrames. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
