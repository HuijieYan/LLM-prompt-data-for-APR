### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `DataFrame` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas core internals. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This may lead to different blocks being considered identical when they are not due to different locations.
2. The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method may not accurately determine equality due to blocks being sorted by different criteria.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of block locations when comparing DataFrames. The sorting of blocks by `canonicalize` function and subsequent comparison using the `equals` method does not account for different block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the block locations are taken into account when comparing DataFrames. The equality check should consider both the content of blocks and their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_locs = [block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring() for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_locs = [block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring() for block in other.blocks]

    if self_block_locs != other_block_locs:
        return False

    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version includes comparing block locations in addition to block content when determining DataFrame equality. The locations are checked using a more robust method to ensure accurate comparison.
