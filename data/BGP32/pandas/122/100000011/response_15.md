### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the `equals` method of the DataFrame in pandas library is returning True incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the canonicalization of blocks based on their type name and manager locations. In this case, blocks with different locations but the same content are considered equal.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The canonicalize function that is used to sort and compare the blocks based on type name and manager locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is sorting and comparing blocks in a way that can result in false positives when blocks have the same content but are located differently.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider block content along with type name and manager locations. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering type name, manager locations, and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block content (values), the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub by considering block content as part of the comparison.
