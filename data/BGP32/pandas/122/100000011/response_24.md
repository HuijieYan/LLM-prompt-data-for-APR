### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing issues where it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug was reported in the GitHub issue detailed above.

### Potential error locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function used to canonicalize the blocks might not be correctly distinguishing between identical blocks with different locations.
2. The comparison between blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `equals` method might not be handling the different locations of identical blocks properly.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because even though the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are identical, their locations are different. The comparison within the `equals` function does not account for this, leading to the incorrect `True` return value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison criteria to take into consideration the identical nature of the blocks despite their different locations. Adjust the comparison logic to ensure that the blocks are considered equal even if their locations vary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the above corrected version, I have modified the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()` for identifying blocks by their location. This adjustment ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified and compared within the `equals` function. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
