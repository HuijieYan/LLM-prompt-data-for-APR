### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is supposed to compare two InternalBlock objects for equality. However, there seems to be an issue with how the blocks are being compared, leading to incorrect results in some cases. The GitHub issue indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` for `DataFrame.equals()` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

### Identifying Potential Errors:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be handling different block locations correctly.
2. The comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not consider all possible scenarios.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Since the blocks are being sorted using a combination of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, consecutive blocks that should be equal might end up being compared with different blocks due to the sorting order. This inconsistency leads to `equals` incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal. One way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information to differentiate blocks more effectively. Additionally, we should review the comparison process between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to address all possible scenarios accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the byte representation of `mgr_locs` to ensure that blocks with different locations are properly distinguished. This fix addresses the incorrect behavior reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the `equals` function correctly returns `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
