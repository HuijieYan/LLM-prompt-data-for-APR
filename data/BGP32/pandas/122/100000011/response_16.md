**Analysis:**
The buggy function `equals` is responsible for comparing two data structures for equality in the pandas library. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

**Error Locations:**
1. Comparing the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might not be sufficient for determining equality.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not handle cases with identical blocks but different locations appropriately.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs due to the issue with comparing blocks by their locations. If two blocks are equal but have different locations, the current implementation might return `True` incorrectly.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to implement a more robust comparison mechanism that takes into account the block contents rather than just the block locations. This can help in correctly identifying cases where identical blocks are in different locations.

**Corrected Version:**
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data and dtype
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return block.to_numpy(), block.dtype

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if set(map(lambda block: canonicalize_block(block), self_blocks)) != set(map(lambda block: canonicalize_block(block), other_blocks)):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the block data and dtype to ensure correctness in detecting equal blocks. This adjustment should address the issue reported on GitHub where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as equal.
