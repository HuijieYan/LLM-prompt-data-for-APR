### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The issue described on GitHub highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug occurs when comparing DataFrames with the same data but with the columns in a different order.
4. The issue is caused by comparing the blocks of the DataFrames directly after sorting them, which may lead to false positives.
5. A strategy to fix this bug would be to sort the blocks based on index and then compare them to avoid false positives.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.index

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function sorts the blocks based on their index before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison accounts for the blocks' actual data instead of just their order, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
