### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is used for comparing two objects, checking if they are equal. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function returns True incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the `canonicalize()` function with `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may not correctly distinguish identical blocks in different locations.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize()` might not handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting mechanism used. Since the sorting is based on type name and locations, it may not correctly handle identical blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect True result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting mechanism considers other factors to differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting blocks based on hash to avoid issues with identical blocks at different locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the `hash()` function to sort the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks in different locations are handled correctly during the comparison.
