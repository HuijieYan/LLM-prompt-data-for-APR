### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing the DataFrame equals method to incorrectly return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub bug report, where a simple test case shows that `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True instead of False.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function might not consider blocks with identical type names but different `mgr_locs`.
2. The comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` may not adequately handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but this sorting may not correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be modified to account for cases where blocks have different locations but are still considered equal. Instead of relying solely on sorting by type name and `mgr_locs`, a more robust equality comparison should be implemented.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the comparison is simplified to only compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This change ensures that the equality check properly handles cases where blocks have different locations but contain the same data.
