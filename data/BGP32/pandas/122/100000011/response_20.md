### Analysis:
The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is not the expected behavior as indicated in the GitHub issue description.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` can lead to different block orders even if the blocks are identical.
2. The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method might not consider the actual content of the blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to two DataFrames with identical blocks being considered different due to block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than just their type names and locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks based on type names and locations and directly compares the blocks using the `equals` method. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
