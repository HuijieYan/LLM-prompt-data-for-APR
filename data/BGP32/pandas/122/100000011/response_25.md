### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two instances of a data structure, checking if they are equal.
2. The reported GitHub issue mentions that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug seems to be related to the way blocks are sorted and compared in the function, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using `canonicalize` function.
2. Comparison of blocks in the sorted order.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the way blocks are sorted based on dtype name and mgr_locs. If two blocks are equivalent but have different locations (`mgr_locs`), they may be ranked differently after sorting. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for sorting and comparing blocks. Instead of relying solely on dtype name and mgr_locs for sorting, we should consider the actual content of the blocks during comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison based on block content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By revising the function to compare blocks directly based on their content (instead of just dtype name and mgr_locs), we should be able to fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
