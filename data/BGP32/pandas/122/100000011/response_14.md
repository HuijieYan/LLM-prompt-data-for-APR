### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the function. The function sorts the DataFrame blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which might result in incorrect ordering and comparison.

### Identified potential error location:
The potential error location causing the bug is the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which might not guarantee the correct comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which might not consider blocks with identical content but different locations as different. This leads to the incorrect result returned by the `equals` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the block for comparison rather than just dtype name and mgr_locs. Additionally, we can directly compare blocks without sorting to ensure the correct comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the sorting of blocks and directly compared blocks using the `equals` method. This modification ensures that blocks are compared based on their content rather than just sorting order.
