### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas library is causing the issue reported on GitHub. The function is supposed to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal and False otherwise. However, in the case of identical blocks with different locations, it wrongly returns True instead of False.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting logic may lead to incorrect results when blocks are identical but in different locations.
2. The comparison logic `block.equals(oblock)` is used to compare individual blocks, which may not be suitable for cases where the same block is present in different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `equals` does not account for scenarios where seemingly identical blocks might be at different locations within the DataFrame. The `canonicalize` function and the block comparison logic do not handle such cases properly, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the block comparison logic to properly handle blocks at different locations while comparing two DataFrames. It might involve modifying the sorting mechanism of blocks to account for their actual data rather than just their types and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values, block.index

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.index.equals(other_block.index):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their actual values and indexes rather than just their types and locations. Then, I added a loop to compare the index and values of each block pair individually to handle cases where identical blocks might be at different locations. This should fix the bug and ensure accurate DataFrame equality comparison.
