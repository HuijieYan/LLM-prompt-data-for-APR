### Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return true incorrectly when the `DataFrame.equals()` method should actually return false. The issue on GitHub highlighted a specific scenario where the `equals` method fails to distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function might not be working as expected.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations due to how the sorting is handled. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on their type and locations, but it fails to consider blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Bug-fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic to consider the block content as the primary sorting key instead of just the type and locations.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Sort blocks based on values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their values, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations will be treated as different in the comparison process. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
