### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the DataFrame equals() method to incorrectly return True in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This behavior is not consistent with the expectation of returning False in such cases, as pointed out in the GitHub issue.

### Error Locations:
1. The function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations appropriately.
2. The use of the `canonicalize()` function to sort the blocks may not consider different block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function fails to account for identical blocks with different locations when comparing DataFrames. The sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize()` function may not guarantee that the order of identical blocks with different locations remains consistent, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that it compares identical blocks' actual content rather than relying on their sorted order based on the `canonicalize()` function. By directly comparing the blocks' content, the function can identify differences in blocks even if they have different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function compares each block in the DataFrames directly using the `equals()` method without relying on sorting based on the `canonicalize()` function. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
