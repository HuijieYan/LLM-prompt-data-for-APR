### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas core internals incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug is reported in a GitHub issue where a simple test case fails to return the expected result of False.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of blocks for equality.
2. Sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks does not consider cases where identical blocks might have different locations. This leads to incorrect comparison of blocks and results in the function wrongly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider not only the type name of the block but also the values in the block. By incorporating the block values in the comparison, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values in the comparison tuple along with the type name and locations. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished during the comparison process, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
