### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `DataFrame` objects for equality. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function `equals` wrongly returns `True` when comparing two identical blocks with different locations. This behavior is not expected, and the function should return `False` in such a case.

### Identified Errors:
1. The bug is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks based on block type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. The sorting logic might lead to incorrect comparisons, especially when the blocks are identical but located differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function, which may change the order of blocks and incorrectly lead to a `True` result when comparing two identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in a way that does not affect the positions of identical blocks. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks based on a unique identifier that remains the same even when the blocks are identical but located differently.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a combination of block type name and block hash to uniquely identify blocks
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of block type name and block hash to uniquely identify the blocks for sorting. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not sorted differently, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
