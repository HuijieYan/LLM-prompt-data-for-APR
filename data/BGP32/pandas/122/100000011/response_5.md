### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `DataFrame` objects to check if they are equal. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The function sorts the blocks during comparison based on the block type name and locations, which can lead to incorrect equality checks.

### Error Locations:
1. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function based on block type and locations.
2. Comparing the sorted blocks to determine equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider the block locations as a factor in determining equality during the comparison. As a result, when the order of blocks is different in two DataFrames but the contents are the same, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism used in the `canonicalize` function to consider the entire block, including its contents and locations. By sorting based on the entire block representation, we can ensure that the comparison takes into account the content and positions of the blocks, leading to a correct equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the content of the block (via `block.values`) and the block locations to generate a unique representation for sorting. This modification ensures correct comparison of identical blocks with different locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
