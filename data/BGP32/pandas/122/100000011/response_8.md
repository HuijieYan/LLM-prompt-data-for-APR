### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is `equals(self, other)`. It is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem where the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, potentially causing issues if the blocks have the same content but different locations.
2. The function relies heavily on the correct implementation of the `equals()` method for blocks, which might not handle the comparison correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on properties that do not guarantee content equality. When two DataFrames have the same blocks but in different locations, the function wrongly returns `True` because of the sorting. This behavior contradicts the expected output specified in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers content equality rather than just sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. We should refactor the `canonicalize` function to focus on the content of the blocks rather than their properties.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple of block values, ensuring that the comparison is based on block content rather than properties. This should address the issue reported on GitHub where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered equal.
