### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames based on their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the usage of the `mgr_locs` attribute for canonicalization, which can lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Identify potential error locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function that generates a tuple for block canonicalization.
2. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `block.equals(oblock)`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the usage of `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function. When two identical blocks exist in different locations, they will have different `mgr_locs`, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalization process to exclude `mgr_locs` from the comparison operation. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's dtype name for canonicalization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name for canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for canonicalization, the comparison of DataFrames based on identical blocks with different locations will now produce the expected result and resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
