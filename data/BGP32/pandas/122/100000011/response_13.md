**Analysis:**

The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of `pandas` is causing an issue where it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations. This bug is also documented in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

**Identified Errors:**

1. The issue arises from how the function canonicalizes the blocks by sorting them based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. Sorting blocks using this method might lead to incorrect comparisons if the blocks have identical content but different locations.

2. The function is not correctly handling the scenario where `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` have identical content but different locations due to the sorting approach.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The bug occurs because the function is using a sorting mechanism to compare blocks based on the type name and locations. This approach can lead to false positives where DataFrames with identical content but different block locations are mistakenly considered equal.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on content rather than their type name and locations. By ensuring that the blocks are compared based on their content only, we can accurately determine whether two DataFrames are equal even if the blocks are at different locations.

**Corrected Version:**

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, other_content)
        for block_content, other_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we extract the content of each block using `block.values` and compare them directly using `np.array_equal`. This way, we are comparing the actual content of the blocks rather than their type name and locations, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
