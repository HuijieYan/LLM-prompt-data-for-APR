## Issues with the buggy function:
1. The `equals` function is mistakenly returning True in cases where identical blocks have different locations, which goes against the expected behavior.
2. The `canonicalize` function is attempting to sort blocks based on their data type names and locations, but this logic is flawed and causing the bug.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the flawed comparison logic of sorting blocks based on data type names and locations in the `canonicalize` function. This flawed sorting mechanism leads to incorrect results, as it fails to properly identify identical blocks with different locations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks are accurately sorted and compared. Specifically, we should focus on comparing the block values themselves rather than sorting based on data type names and locations.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we removed the `canonicalize` function and changed the comparison directly to the `block.equals(oblock)` to compare the block values themselves. This adjustment ensures an accurate comparison of blocks between the two objects, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
