### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `equals()` compares two DataFrame objects based on their axes, blocks, and block locations. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out that the function wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `canonicalize()` function to sort blocks based on type name and mgr_locs.
2. Comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize()` function does not take into account the differences in block locations. Sorting the blocks solely based on dtype name and mgr_locs might not accurately reflect the actual equality of the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison mechanism must consider the block locations as well. Instead of solely relying on dtype name and mgr_locs, the comparison should incorporate a more robust method that considers the actual data location within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare blocks based on actual data
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Conclusion:
The changed implementation now compares the DataFrame blocks based on actual data values rather than just the type name and locations. This fix should accurately determine equality between DataFrames and address the issue reported on GitHub.
