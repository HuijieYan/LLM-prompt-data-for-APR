### Analysis:
This buggy function is part of the pandas library and is responsible for checking equality between two internal data structures. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method returns True incorrectly in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.
2. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might lead to incorrect equivalence checks.
3. The comparison using `all()` might not properly identify discrepancies in block equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on a combination of the block type and their locations. This can lead to issues when comparing blocks with the same data but arranged differently, giving a false positive result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks focuses only on the data contents and not on their locations or types. By modifying the comparison logic to check only the block equality based on data, we can accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    # Check for equality of each block
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

This corrected version removes the use of the `canonicalize` function and sorts the blocks solely based on their contents. Then, it iterates through each block pair in the sorted lists and checks for equality based on the data content only. This approach ensures an accurate comparison and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
