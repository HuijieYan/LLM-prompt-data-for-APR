### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is designed to compare two `Manager` objects and check if they are equal. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` might be causing the issue.
2. The comparison logic of blocks using `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the sorting based on `dtype.name` and location of blocks which might not be sufficient to ensure the correct comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the DataFrames are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison approach in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on sorting by `dtype` names and locations, we should directly compare the blocks while considering the location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare blocks while considering location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing blocks without sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the equality of DataFrames even with identical blocks but different locations.
