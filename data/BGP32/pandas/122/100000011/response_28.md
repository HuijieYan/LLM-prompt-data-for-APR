### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two DataFrames for equality. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, when it should be returning `False`. This discrepancy could be due to the sorting of blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and manager locations. If the blocks have the same values but different locations, they might still be considered equal based on this comparison.

### Error Location:
The issue is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function, where the blocks are being sorted based on block type name and manager locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on both type name and manager locations, without considering the case where identical blocks could have different locations. This leads to incorrectly identifying blocks as equal when they are not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it only considers the block type name for sorting, and not the manager locations. This way, the comparison will focus on the values of the blocks themselves, rather than their physical locations.

### Fixed Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function now only considers the block's dtype name for sorting the blocks. This update ensures that the comparison focuses on the actual values of the blocks, rather than their specific locations. This change should address the bug reported on GitHub.
