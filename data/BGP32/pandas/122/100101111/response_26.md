### Error in the Buggy Function:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two BlockManager objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, there is a flaw in the function that causes it to return True incorrectly when the blocks have different locations but are actually identical.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails due to the way it iterates over the blocks and compares them. It uses a sorting mechanism that doesn't consider the equality of blocks with different locations ultimately causing incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks within the `equals` function to account for cases where blocks are identical but have different locations. We need to ensure that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks using actual content instead of locations
    def check_blocks_equal(block, oblock):
        if block.equals(oblock):
            return True
        return block.values.shape == oblock.values.shape and np.allclose(block.values, oblock.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        check_blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between blocks is based on their actual content, taking into account cases where blocks may have the same content but different locations. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
