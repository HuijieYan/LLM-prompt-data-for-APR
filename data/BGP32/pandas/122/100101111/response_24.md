### Bug Understanding:
The buggy `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. If the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal, the function should return `True`. However, due to the sorting process before comparison and the way `canonicalize` function is implemented, a false negative occurs, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function currently sorts by the block's dtype name and then its location (`mgr_locs`). Due to different data types and locations (in the failing test case, dtype='int64' and location differences), blocks with the same data but different locations end up being considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to prioritize sorting based on the content of the blocks rather than their data type and locations. By focusing on the block's actual data, we can ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their specific dtype or location.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version focuses on comparing the block's actual values by using `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the blocks are sorted based on their content. This approach should resolve the bug and allow the function to correctly compare blocks for equality in the provided failing test case.
