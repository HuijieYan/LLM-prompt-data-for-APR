### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is currently comparing blocks in a DataFrame by sorting them based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to wrongly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is the cause of the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, instead of sorting and comparing the blocks directly, we should compare the blocks one by one and ensure they are equivalent. This will accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the DataFrames' blocks are compared directly without sorting, providing the correct equality check.
