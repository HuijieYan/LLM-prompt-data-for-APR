### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManagers (representing DataFrame blocks) to check for equality based on axes and blocks. The bug seems to arise from sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` using a custom `canonicalize` function. This sorting might lead to different block orders despite having the same contents, causing the `equals` function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Location:
The issue likely lies in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting can change the order of blocks, leading to the incorrect comparison.

### Cause of Bug:
The reason for the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not ensuring an accurate comparison based on block contents. Due to the sorting mechanism, even if the blocks have the same data, different block orderings can result in a false inequality assessment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, we need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we prioritize content equality rather than the order of the blocks. Removing the custom sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs should prevent the incorrect results. A better approach could be to directly compare blocks without sorting them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we avoid sorting the blocks and directly compare them based on their content. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave correctly in the provided test case.
