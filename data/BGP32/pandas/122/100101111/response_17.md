### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals()` function is intended to compare two DataFrame objects for equality.
- The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames are equal. If any difference is found, it returns `False`.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the ordering of blocks based on their type and locations.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `['a', 'b']`, but in different order, causing the equality check to fail.
- Even though the columns are the same, since they are in different orders, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
- The bug is in the way the function handles block ordering using `canonicalize()` function, which does not consider the potential difference in the column orders.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to include additional checks for column order.
- We need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we also consider the ordering of columns within those blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's index or column names in the `canonicalize()` function, we ensure that the function considers block ordering based on both data type and column order, effectively addressing the bug described in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
