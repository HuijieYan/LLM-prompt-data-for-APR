### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects representing the structure of DataFrames. The comparison involves checking the equality of axes and blocks within the DataFrames. The bug seems to stem from an issue in the canonicalization of blocks using their dtype name and manager locations.

### Identified Issue:
The bug arises when comparing blocks within DataFrames that have identical values but differ in their locations (mgr_locs). This leads to an incorrect comparison result in the `equals` function, causing the failing test case to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to modify the block canonicalization process in the `equals` function. Instead of solely relying on the dtype name and manager locations to determine block equality, we should include the actual block values as well in the canonicalization process.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function that implements the suggested bug fix strategy:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering dtype, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values along with dtype and mgr_locs in the canonicalization process, the corrected function should now return the expected result for the failing test case, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
