### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The comparison of blocks is being done based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. This can lead to incorrect comparisons when blocks have different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare blocks could lead to incorrect results if the blocks have different locations.
2. The comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` using `all()` and `zip()` may overlook the differences in block locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not account for blocks with different locations when comparing `BlockManager` objects. This leads to the function falsely returning `True` even when the blocks are not equal. The test case provided expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare blocks within the `BlockManager`, accounting for differences in locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks in order
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare each block individually
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`, ensuring accurate comparison results.
