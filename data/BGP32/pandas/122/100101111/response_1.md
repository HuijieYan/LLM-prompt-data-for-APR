### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue arises when comparing the blocks inside each `BlockManager`. The bug originates from sorting and comparing the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which can lead to incorrect comparison results due to different block locations for identical blocks.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Sorting based on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` can lead to different orders for identical blocks with different locations.
3. This inconsistent sorting results in incorrect comparison making `equals()` wrongly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks by `block.dtype.name` only, which ensures correct comparison even for identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function will now properly compare the blocks based only on the `dtype.name`, ensuring correct comparison results for identical blocks with different locations.
