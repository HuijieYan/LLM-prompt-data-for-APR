### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. However, a bug causes it to incorrectly return True in certain cases when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from the sorting logic in the function. Even if the blocks are identical in content, the sorting done based on dtype name and mgr_locs may lead to different orderings and consequently incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure blocks with identical contents are compared correctly regardless of order.
2. Update the comparison logic to handle the scenario where blocks with different locations are considered identical.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort blocks based on content not just dtype and location
    self_blocks = [b.values for b in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [b.values for b in other.blocks]
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block, oblock, check_dtype=False, check_index_type=False, check_column_type=False)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual content of the blocks using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal()`, we can ensure that blocks with the same contents are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their locations.
