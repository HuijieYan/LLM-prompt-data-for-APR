### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function is incorrectly sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting is based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but this sorting does not consider the block order correctly when comparing two dataframes. This leads to the function returning `True` even when the dataframes are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the sorting logic to ensure that the block's order is considered correctly when comparing two dataframes.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Keep the block order when comparing
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will consider the block order directly when comparing two dataframes, ensuring that the function returns the correct result.
