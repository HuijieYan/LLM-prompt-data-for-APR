### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises in the `equals` method where the comparison of `BlockManager` objects is not considering the order of blocks within them. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute, which might be incorrect since it doesn't account for the actual block data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To solve this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the equality of blocks based on their actual content rather than just their metadata. This can be achieved by comparing the actual block data during the equality check.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on actual content
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)  # Compare actual block data

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the equality check now compares the actual block data within `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the comparison is based on the content rather than just the metadata. This should address the issue stated in the GitHub bug report.
