### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents. The bug arises from not handling the case where identical blocks have different locations. This issue is reflected in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with identical blocks but switched column orders should not be considered equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `canonicalize` that helps in sorting the blocks is based only on the block's data type and locations within the BlockManager. This means that when blocks have the same data type but different locations, they are considered equal, resulting in a wrong equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to include a more reliable way to differentiate blocks, such as considering the block's data values for comparison, in addition to the data type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._bert_ds(as_array=False), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
The corrected version of the function now includes the data values of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function for sorting, not just the data type and block locations. This modification ensures that blocks with identical data type but different values will be correctly identified as unequal.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now handle cases like the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where DataFrame blocks have been switched in order but still contain different data values. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
