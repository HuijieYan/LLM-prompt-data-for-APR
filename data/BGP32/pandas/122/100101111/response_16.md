### Analysis:
The `equals` function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. In the failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are intentionally created with different values in the columns. The function should correctly identify the difference and return `False`. However, due to the sorting issue in `canonicalize` function, the comparison fails.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not correctly differentiating between blocks that have the same dtype but different locations. This leads to incorrect block sorting which affects the final comparison using `all`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to account for both `dtype` and `mgr_locs` in a more reliable manner to properly sort the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs._locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs._locs` for a more precise sorting of blocks, the corrected version should now correctly identify differences in block locations while comparing two BlockManager objects.
