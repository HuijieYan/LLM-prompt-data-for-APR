### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. The issue is likely caused by the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare blocks, which may not handle all cases correctly.
3. The failing test provided demonstrates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing `df1` and `df2`, which have different data types in corresponding columns.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison handles data type differences within blocks properly.
  
### Bug Fix Suggestions:
1. Update the sorting mechanism to consider both the data type and content of the block.
2. Implement a more robust comparison method for blocks that can handle different data types effectively.
3. Ensure that the function correctly detects differences in data types within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining data type and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the sorting mechanism to consider both the block's values/content and data types, we aim to accurately compare and identify differences between blocks. This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
