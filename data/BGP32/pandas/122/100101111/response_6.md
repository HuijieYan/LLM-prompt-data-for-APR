### Issue Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the BlockManager in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function fails to correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal, specifically when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Location
The bug likely stems from how the `equals` function compares the `self_axes` and `other_axes` and sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The issue might be related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations, leading to failing test cases and a discrepancy between expected and actual outputs.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should explicitly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations to ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their order or location.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values[0])

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version explicitly compares the actual content of the blocks during the sorting process, ensuring that the comparison considers the content rather than the order or location.
