### Issue Analysis:
The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects in Pandas, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, the current implementation has a bug where it wrongly returns `True` even if the blocks have different locations.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to stem from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function tries to canonicalize the blocks by sorting them based on the combination of the data type name and location, but it fails to consider the distinct locations of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
In the provided failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) are constructed with columns `'a'` and `'b'`, containing integer and string values in opposite positions. The implemented `equals` function fails to detect the difference in block locations due to the flawed comparison logic, leading to an incorrect `True` return.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly handle blocks with different locations. The sorting logic based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` should be enhanced to consider the uniqueness of block locations as well.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block location information within the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks with different locations are no longer considered equal. This modification will make the comparison more robust and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
