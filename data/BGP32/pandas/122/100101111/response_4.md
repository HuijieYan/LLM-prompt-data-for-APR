### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises from how the `canonicalize` function is implemented within the `equals` method. The function `canonicalize` is used to create a key to sort blocks by data type and manager locations. In this case, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function doesn't correctly handle the comparison of blocks from `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` even when the blocks have different data but identical manager locations. This behavior is incorrect because it should return `False` when the data in the blocks is not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and actual data values within the block when creating the key for sorting. This adjustment will ensure that identical blocks with different data values are not incorrectly flagged as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        if isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            key += (block.values.tolist(),)
        else:
            key += (block.values,)
        return key

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction considers the block's values and data type in addition to the manager locations, ensuring a proper comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case provided.
