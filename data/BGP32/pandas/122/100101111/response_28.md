### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function takes two `BlockManager` objects as input and compares them for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks if the number of axes is the same, then compares each axis and finally compares the blocks present in both `BlockManager` objects.
3. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly for identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to arise from comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` where the function is not properly handling different block locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function incorrectly compares the blocks by sorting them based on their types and locations, leading to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal.
2. Due to the sorting mechanism on `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the comparison does not consider the actual content of the blocks but only their types and locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change how the blocks are compared in the `equals` function. We should ensure that the content of each block is being compared rather than just their types and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks from `self` and `other` without sorting based on type and location, the corrected version of the function ensures that the content of the blocks is properly compared for equality.
