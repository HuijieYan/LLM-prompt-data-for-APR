### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes match, then consolidates them in place before comparing the blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks (which contain data) between the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` because the values in the dataframes are different.
4. The bug causes the comparison step to return `True` instead of `False` due to potential issues in the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which may lead to blocks with identical data but different locations being considered equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the sorting method to include more specific information about the blocks to prevent blocks with different locations but similar data from being considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and data values
    # to ensure distinction even for blocks with identical data but different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the updated version of the function, the comparison should now correctly handle blocks with identical data but different locations, ensuring that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass as expected.
