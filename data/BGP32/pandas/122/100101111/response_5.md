### Bug Analysis:
The issue arises from the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to a failed test case where two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different cell values but the same column names are mistakenly considered equal.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to stem from how the function sorts and compares blocks within the DataFrames. By sorting blocks based on their type name and manager locations, the function might miss different blocks that have the same characteristics but different actual values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when comparing blocks of DataFrames. If blocks have the same characteristics (type name, manager locations), but contain different values, the function erroneously concludes that the DataFrames are equal. This is contrary to the expected behavior where the DataFrames should only be considered equal if they have matching data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function determines the equality of blocks within DataFrames. Instead of solely relying on the type name and manager locations, we should include a comparison of the actual data within the blocks to ensure that accurately reflects the DataFrame's content.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting criteria for blocks in the `equals` function to include a comparison based on the block's actual data values, we ensure that blocks with different values are not mistakenly considered equal. This correction should resolve the bug and align the behavior of the function with the expected outcome.
