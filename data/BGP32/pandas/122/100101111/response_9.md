### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison relies on the order of the blocks but does not consider the actual content of the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality evaluations.

In the failing test, the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have the same column names (`a` and `b`) but with values swapped in columns. The buggy function wrongly returns `True` for `df1.equals(df2)` instead of the expected `False` due to the unconsidered content comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should not solely rely on the order; it should also check the content within the blocks. By sorting and comparing the blocks based on their content, we can ensure a correct equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on content before comparison, the corrected function ensures accurate equality evaluations between `BlockManager` objects.
