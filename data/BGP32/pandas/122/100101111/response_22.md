### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, it fails in cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations. This issue was reported on GitHub as the function wrongly returns `True` in such cases.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where blocks have the same content but are located differently. The comparison based on `block.mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks leads to false positives for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Instead of sorting blocks based on `block.mgr_locs`, we can sort them based on a combination of block content and data type.
2. Update the equality check logic to properly compare sorted blocks for equality.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.to_numpy().tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The bug-fixed version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content (converted to a list) and data type, resolving the issue of incorrectly identifying blocks with different locations as equal when they have the same content. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the cases where identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as inequal.
