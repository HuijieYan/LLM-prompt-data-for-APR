### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing their blocks. However, the comparison of blocks is flawed due to the way blocks are sorted before comparison. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, but the issue arises when comparing blocks that are unconsolidated, such as categorical blocks.

In this specific case, the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns `'a'` containing different data types. The buggy `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` as it fails to differentiate the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the comparison logic in the `equals()` function, specifically when comparing the blocks. Instead of relying solely on sorting blocks based on dtype and manager locations, we should consider additional factors like block values. We need to ensure that even unconsolidated blocks are correctly compared for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare and sort blocks based on dtype, manager locations, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `equals()` function should now properly compare DataFrames, taking into account the blocks' dtype, manager locations, and values, as suggested by the fix strategy.
