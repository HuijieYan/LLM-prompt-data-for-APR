### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects which represent the internal structure of data blocks. The function checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` objects are equal, then consolidates them and compares the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
- In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have different data types for corresponding columns, which should make them unequal according to the test.
- The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks after consolidating, where it fails to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function comparing the blocks using the `equals` method without considering the data types of the blocks. The function incorrectly returns True when comparing blocks with different data types.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider the data types as well. We can enhance the `canonicalize` function to include block data types. Then, during block comparison, we should compare both data types and block data to ensure the correct comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block data types in the comparison within the corrected function, it should now correctly identify `df1` and `df2` as unequal as expected. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
