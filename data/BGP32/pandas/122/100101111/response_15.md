### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic within the function, specifically in the comparison of blocks. The bug causes the function to wrongly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

In the failing test case provided, `test_dataframe_not_equal()`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with columns swapped compared to each other. The expected outcome is for `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False` due to the difference in column order.

Looking at the provided runtime values and types of variables, and expected values and types during test execution, it's clear that the block sorting logic `(sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize))` is not considering the block locations. This leads to the incorrect return of `True` even when block locations differ.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison includes the block locations. Adjust the logic to properly account for the block ordering and locations when comparing the two BlockManager objects.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will now properly compare the blocks taking into consideration their locations, and the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should now return the expected `False`.
