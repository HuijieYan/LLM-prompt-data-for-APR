### Bug Explanation:

The issue arises from the fact that the `equals` function is not properly comparing the blocks inside the `BlockManager`. It is erroneously considering blocks with the same content but different locations as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks inside the `BlockManager` considers not only the content but also the locations of the blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs and block values to ensure the blocks are compared correctly
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs, block.values))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function takes into account the block values in addition to the block dtype and mgr_locs when comparing the blocks inside the `BlockManager`. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
