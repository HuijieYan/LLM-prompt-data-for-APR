### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for comparison. The issue occurs when two identical blocks have different locations, leading to a false positive in the equality check.

The problem stems from the handling of block locations during comparison, resulting in incorrectly identifying blocks with the same data but different locations as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to accurately identify blocks with the same data but different locations as equal. One approach is to compare the actual block data instead of just the tuple of `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block1.get_values().equals(block2.get_values()):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version, we compare the actual block values using `get_values()` instead of the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal.
