### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of blocks within two instances. The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function used for ordering blocks does not distinguish between blocks that may have the same content but different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual location of the block in addition to the block's content. This modification will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly treated as equal. By updating the sorting mechanism for blocks, the `equals` function will be able to correctly identify differences between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tostring(), hash(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block content, block location (as a hash), and the block data type, we ensure that blocks are ordered based on their complete characteristics. This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub and fix the bug in the `equals` function.
