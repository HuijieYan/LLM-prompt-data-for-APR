### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and block types. However, the buggy function has a flaw in sorting the blocks before comparison. The sorting is done based on a tuple combining the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which might lead to incorrect comparison results if the blocks have the same dtype but different locations.

The issue reported on GitHub further confirms this problem, where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the sorting key for blocks in a way that takes into account block equality regardless of their manager locations.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining dtype.name for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Now compare each block instead of sorting based on location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the sorting key in the corrected version of the function to only consider the block's `dtype.name`, we ensure that blocks with the same dtype will be correctly compared for equality, regardless of their locations. This modification addresses the issue of incorrect equality comparison identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
