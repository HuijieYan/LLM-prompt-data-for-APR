### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances where the blocks have the same data but different locations, causing the comparison to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to compare the blocks based on their data rather than their location.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block data for comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.data.tobytes()
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare the block data directly, we ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances evaluates based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their locations. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly.
