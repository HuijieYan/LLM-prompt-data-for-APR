## Identifying the bug

1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the axes of two BlockManager instances and then sorting their blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting logic might lead to inconsistent comparisons when the blocks have the same dtype name but different locations.

2. The bug causes the `equals` method to return True when comparing two DataFrame instances with identical blocks but different locations, leading to false positives.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method. Instead of sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, we should compare each block directly. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing each block in the two BlockManager instances, we ensure that the equality check considers the content of the blocks rather than their sorting order.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test provided.
