### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are of the same length and if each pair of axes objects are equal using their `equals` method.

Then, the function consolidates the blocks of both instances in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` function. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in each instance and if they are not equal, returns `False`.

The issue with the buggy function arises during the comparison of blocks. It sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, for identical blocks with different locations, the equality check fails.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that it does not handle the case where blocks are identical but have different locations due to the sorting mechanism used to compare them. This can lead to the function incorrectly returning `False` even when the blocks are actually equal.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in a way that reflects their actual equality while considering their locations. One way to do this is to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than just their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

This corrected version removes the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` and directly compares blocks for equality. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
