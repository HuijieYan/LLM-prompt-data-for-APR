### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is due to the comparison logic of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The comparison is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual content of the blocks during the equality check. The comparison is solely based on sorting the blocks by a combination of data type and locations, which might result in incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be revised to consider the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their data type and locations. This can be achieved by directly comparing the content of each block in the `self.blocks` list with the corresponding block in the `other.blocks` list.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the content of each block, the corrected version of the `equals` function should be able to correctly identify cases where two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks with different locations as equal.
