### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the sorting logic applied to `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. When sorting these blocks, the dtype name and manager locations are used as keys, which may result in incorrect comparisons between blocks with the same content but different locations.

### Explanation of Bug:
1. The `equals` function first compares the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` to determine if they have the same number of axes. If they don't, the function returns `False`.
2. Then, the function iterates through the axes and compares them. If any of the axes do not match, it returns `False`.
3. Next, it consolidates both `self` and `other` in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` function.
4. Subsequently, the function compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
5. Here's where the bug occurs: 
    - The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on `canonicalize`, which generates a key using the block's dtype name and manager locations.
    - This sorting may lead to false positives if blocks have the same content but different locations, as the comparison is based on locations.
    - The comparison using `equals` also relies on this sorted order, leading to incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub, the sorting on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs adjustments. Rather than using the block's dtype name and manager locations to create the key for sorting, a more robust comparison approach should be implemented. One possible solution is to compare the content of the blocks directly without considering the locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, oblock_content)
        for block_content, oblock_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

By comparing the content of the blocks directly without considering the locations, this corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue and pass the failing test provided.
