### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is creating a tuple using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as the sorting key. However, the issue arises because `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not a reliable way to distinguish blocks.

### Solution Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to use a more robust way to distinguish blocks rather than relying on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. One approach could be to use a combination of the block's content for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use the block content for comparison
        return (block.values, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use more reliable attributes of the block for comparison, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
