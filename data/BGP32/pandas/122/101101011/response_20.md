### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return True even when the blocks have different locations. The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks (self_blocks and other_blocks) is done based on their type name and locations. However, the comparison should not rely on the block's location to ensure correct equality checking.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function that determines the sorting key for blocks. The sorting key should only include the type name of the block and not its location. This change will ensure that the equality comparison of blocks is solely based on their type and not their position, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the fixed `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's type name, the equality check will be accurate regardless of the block's location, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
