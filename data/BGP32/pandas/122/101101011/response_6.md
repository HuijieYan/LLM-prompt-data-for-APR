### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two block managers `self` and `other` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue encountered is due to the comparison logic not handling identical blocks with different locations correctly.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, where the columns are swapped. The expected result is `False` as the DataFrames are not equal.
4. The buggy function sorts the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs` and compares them. However, it is sorting blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider identical blocks with different locations as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider `block.mgr_locs` as part of the sorting key.
2. This change will ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are considered unequal during the comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic to reflect the changes made to the sorting key.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function's sorting key, we ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are now correctly treated as unequal. This correction resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
