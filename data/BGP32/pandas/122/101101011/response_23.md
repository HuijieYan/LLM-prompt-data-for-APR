### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the pandas library is intended to check the equality of two instances based on their axes, blocks, and block data. However, the bug lies in how the function handles the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization process that combines the type name and the manager's locations, which might lead to incorrect results when comparing blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately. Instead of relying on sorting the blocks using a canonicalization process that could be misleading, we should compare the blocks directly based on their data.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods are omitted for brevity

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks directly based on their data
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

By comparing the blocks directly based on their data in the corrected version of the `equals` function, we ensure a more accurate comparison that avoids the issue of sorting based on potentially misleading canonicalization. This should resolve the bug and make the function return correct results in cases like the failing test provided.
