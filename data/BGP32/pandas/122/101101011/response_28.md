### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks from two different instances. 
2. The comparison logic involves sorting the blocks based on their data type and locations, but it fails to consider the dtype and mgr_locs being compared within the blocks.
3. The comparison logic does not take into account the different blocks' data types and locations which can lead to incorrect equality results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` method to handle the comparison of blocks more accurately, considering both dtype and mgr_locs.
2. Ensure that the sorting and comparison process includes all necessary block attributes to determine equality correctly.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` stored as bytes and by modifying the sorting and comparison process, the function now accurately compares blocks within different instances based on their data type and locations. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
