### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` objects to determine equality.
- The function first checks if the lengths of the `axes` are different, in which case it returns `False`.
- It then checks if each pair of axes is equal through a list comprehension. If any pair is not equal, it returns `False`.
- After consolidating both instances, it compares the number of blocks. If these numbers are different, it returns `False`.
- The function then proceeds to sort the blocks based on a canonicalization function and compares each pair of blocks.
- The issue described in the GitHub post points out that the `equals` function is returning `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects that have the same blocks but in different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not take into consideration the actual values within the blocks but only the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values.
- When comparing two `DataFrame` objects with the same data but in different block locations, the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` can cause the function to incorrectly return `True`.

### Proposed Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values within the blocks for comparison instead of just `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
- Adjust the sorting mechanism to compare the block data directly rather than relying on block metadata.
- By changing the sorting criteria to compare block data values, we can ensure that the function accurately determines equality between different `DataFrame` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function uses `block.values.tolist()` to create a sorting key that considers the actual values within the blocks. This modification ensures that the function accurately compares the data blocks between two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
