### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function, which is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares `self_axes` and `other_axes` lengths and then iterates over the blocks in the managers.
3. The main bug lies in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a key generated by the `canonicalize` function, which is not working correctly due to the use of `mgr_locs` for generating the key. This leads to incorrect block order comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to refine the key generation in the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent the blocks' content for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include more information from the block, ensuring uniqueness in the generated key to differentiate blocks accurately.
2. Modify the comparison of blocks in the function to use the refined key to compare the block attributes effectively.
3. Verify the fix by running the failing test case to ensure the corrected version passes the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Fix the key generation for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        key = []
        if isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            key.extend([block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist()])
        elif isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            key.extend([block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist()])
        return tuple(key)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above corrections in place, the `equals` function should now generate accurate comparisons for the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
