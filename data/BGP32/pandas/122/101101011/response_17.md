### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and the locations of the blocks (`mgr_locs`) can lead to incorrect comparisons. This is because even if the blocks are identical in content, they might have different locations, leading to a false comparison result.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, instead of sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the blocks directly without relying on the sorting logic that can cause incorrect equality evaluations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Note:
Now the corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the equality comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, leading to correct outcomes, as intended.
