### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing BlockManager objects `self` and `other` based on their axes, block quantities, and blocks data.
2. The bug arises because the function does not properly compare the order of blocks for equality, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by comparing two DataFrame objects that are not equal but the buggy function erroneously returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects considers the order of the blocks as well.
5. A revised version of the `equals` function is provided below to address the bug.

### Revised Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)) and len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks)
```

The revised version incorporates additional logic to ensure that the order of blocks is taken into account during comparison, which resolves the issue and aligns with the expected output.
