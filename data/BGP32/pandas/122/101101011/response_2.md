### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. However, it fails to correctly check for equality in some scenarios, as reported in the GitHub issue. The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparison logic or improper handling of blocks with identical data but different locations.

In the failing test case provided, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two dataframes are created with columns swapped. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` in this case, indicating that the dataframes are not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Location:
The bug appears in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The function properly compares the number of axes and individual axes but then fails to handle the comparison of blocks effectively due to the incorrect ordering and comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect ordering of blocks before the comparison. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks does not consider block locations, leading to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal. This results in the function wrongly returning `True` for dataframes with swapped block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Specifically, the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` should consider both the block type and locations to differentiate between blocks with the same data. By ensuring that blocks are correctly ordered based on their type and location, the function can accurately determine equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with updated sorting logic:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code uses both the block type and locations in the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper sorting of blocks before comparison, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
