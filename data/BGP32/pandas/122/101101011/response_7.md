### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the comparison of blocks is done based on their order, which can be incorrect as the blocks may have different storage locations. This results in identical blocks with different storage locations being considered unequal.

In the failed test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames with identical data but with columns swapped. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for them, which is incorrect.

The `canonicalize` function tries to order the blocks based on their data type and memory locations, which is not reliable for determining equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order or memory locations. We can achieve this by comparing each block in `self.blocks` with its corresponding block in `other.blocks` regardless of their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block._slice)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block._slice)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their order or memory locations, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
