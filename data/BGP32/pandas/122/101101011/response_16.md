### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. 
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to consider the order of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, leading to incorrect comparison results.
3. The comparison logic relies on sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which currently wrongly uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This leads to incorrect sorting and equality checks.
4. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` for cases where the blocks have identical data but differ in locations, contrary to the expected behavior.
5. The failing test clearly demonstrates the bug by comparing two dataframes with different data types in columns 'a' and 'b'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to correctly compare the contents of the blocks rather than their locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.ravel().tobytes()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now compares the block values directly, ensuring a correct comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
