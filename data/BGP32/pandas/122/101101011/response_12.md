## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is due to the comparison of blocks using a `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their type and locations. However, in the provided runtime values, it is evident that the positions of the blocks are actually different between `self` and `other`, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

The reason for the bug can be attributed to comparing the blocks solely based on their type and location without considering the actual values within the blocks. This leads to a false positive result when the block positions are different in `self` and `other`, causing the equals function to return `True` erroneously.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to implement a comparison mechanism that takes into account both the type, location, and values within the blocks. By enhancing the comparison logic to consider the block values along with their characteristics, we can ensure a correct result is returned.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function now compares the blocks based on their type, location, and actual values within the blocks, ensuring a correct comparison result. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as expected.
