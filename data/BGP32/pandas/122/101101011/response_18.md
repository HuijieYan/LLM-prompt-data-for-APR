### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by their axes, blocks, and their internal block components. The bug leads to incorrect comparisons, causing the function to return unexpected results, as seen in the failing test case.

### Bug Description:
The bug arises due to the incorrect comparison strategy used in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances based on their order after sorting by `canonicalize`, which uses the block's dtype name and location. However, the bug occurs when blocks have identical data but are located differently, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider block data equality rather than block locations. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies identical blocks irrespective of their location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

Now, the corrected `equals` function considers the equality of block data rather than the locations, ensuring correct comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
