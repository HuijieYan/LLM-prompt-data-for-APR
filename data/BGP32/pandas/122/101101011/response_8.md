### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the fact that when comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the comparison is done based on the order of the blocks in the list. However, the blocks may be identical but in different locations, causing the comparison to fail when it shouldn't. This bug leads to `equals` wrongly returning `False` in some cases where the blocks are actually identical but have different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly compare blocks based on their content rather than their order. We can achieve this by comparing blocks using their content instead of their order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on content
    self_blocks_content = {block: block.values for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_content = {block: block.values for block in other.blocks}
    
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other_blocks_content or not np.array_equal(self_blocks_content[block], other_blocks_content[block]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will properly compare the blocks based on their content, ensuring that the function returns the correct result in cases where the blocks are identical but in different locations. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
