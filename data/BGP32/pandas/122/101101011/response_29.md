Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the usage of `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the blocks have different locations but are identical. This issue was reported on GitHub under the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

### Bug Cause:
The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not consider the block's location (mgr_locs) when creating the tuple for sorting. This results in identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, which leads to the function returning `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to include the block's location (`mgr_locs`) along with the dtype name in the tuple. This change will ensure that blocks with the same data type but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, including block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location in the tuple, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
