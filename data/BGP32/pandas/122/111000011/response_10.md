## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The function compares the axes of the current `BlockManager` object with the axes of another `BlockManager` object. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function iterates through the `blocks` attribute of both `BlockManager` objects and compares each block. However, the comparison relies on the order of blocks, leading to unexpected results as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The issue reported indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks are identical but located differently.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks based on their order, rather than comparing the actual content of the blocks. This causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks are identical but located at different indices.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on their actual content rather than their order or location. We can achieve this by comparing the content of the blocks using a suitable method like `equals` or directly comparing the `values` of blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We compare the axes using the `equals` method.
2. We sort the blocks based on their values by converting them to strings to ensure a consistent comparison.
3. We then iterate through both sorted block lists and compare each block using the `equals` method.

This correction ensures that the `equals` function properly compares the content of blocks rather than their order, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
