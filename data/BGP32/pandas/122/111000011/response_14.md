### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.
2. The function first checks the equality of the axes of the two instances and then further compares the blocks within the instances.
3. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that in some cases, `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` when blocks are identical but have different locations.
4. The problematic code seems to be in the block ordering logic where blocks are sorted based on the datatype name and `mgr_locs` in a tuple. This can cause the incorrect comparison and lead to `True` being returned in cases where it should be `False`.
5. The bug may be related to how the blocks are ordered and compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Address the issue of inconsistent comparison by ensuring that the block comparison logic is reliable and correctly identifies differences between blocks.
2. Instead of relying on block ordering by datatype name and `mgr_locs`, we can revise the comparison process to directly compare block data for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, we have removed the sorting of blocks based on a tuple that includes datatype name and `mgr_locs`.
2. Instead, we directly compare each block with the corresponding block from the other `BlockManager` instance using the `equals` method.
3. This direct block comparison ensures that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks rather than their ordering or internal details.
4. By simplifying the block comparison logic, we aim to address the issue reported on GitHub where identical blocks with different locations were wrongly considered equal.
