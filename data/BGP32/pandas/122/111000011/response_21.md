## Analysis:
Based on the information provided in the buggy function and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` method is expected to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames based on their block contents, even if the block locations are different.

## Identified Error:
The bug arises from comparing the blocks based on their locations, leading to `equals` incorrectly returning `False` when the block locations are different, even if the content is the same.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug is caused by the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals` method based on their locations, thereby failing to recognize blocks with identical content but different locations.
2. When comparing DataFrames, even if the block locations are different, if the content of the blocks is the same, the DataFrames should be considered equal.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare block content regardless of their locations. By focusing on the content of the blocks rather than their locations, we can ensure that identical blocks are recognized as equal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Extract block contents for comparison
    self_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    # Check if the block contents are the same, regardless of locations
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_content, other_content)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the block contents using `np.array_equal` to ensure that even if the block locations are different, as long as the content is the same, the DataFrames will be considered equal. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
