### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks within the manager.
2. The bug described in the GitHub issue relates to the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function when comparing `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them, leading to a false positive result when blocks are identical but have different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on their type name only for comparison without considering their locations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions as defined in the original code
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Canonicalize block order based on type name only for comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function will only sort the blocks based on their type name for comparison, resolving the issue of falsely returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
