### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. 
2. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results in some cases where identical blocks have different locations.
3. The bug is reported in a GitHub issue where the expected output of `df3.equals(df4)` is `False`, but the function wrongly returns `True`.
4. The bug arises when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects without taking into consideration the block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects without considering their locations. The function sorts the blocks based on their type names and then compares them without considering their actual positions within the objects. This can lead to incorrect equality results when the blocks have different locations but contain the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to also consider the locations of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. We need to ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()`) in determining the uniqueness of each block. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are treated as unequal, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
