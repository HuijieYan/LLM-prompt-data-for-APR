The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrame blocks with identical content but different locations due to not handling the block comparison correctly. This behavior is not intended and leads to incorrect equality checks for DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that combines the block type name and location before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by sorting the blocks before comparing them, using a canonical representation that considers both the block type name and location. This ensures that the equality check correctly handles cases where blocks have identical content but different locations.
