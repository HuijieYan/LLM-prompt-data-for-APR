## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
2. The buggy function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, sorts the blocks, and then iterates over the blocks to check if they are equal.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks at the end of the function. The existing implementation may not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to handle different locations of identical blocks correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of directly comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, we should compare the blocks based on their content.
2. We can achieve this by comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks.
3. If the `mgr_locs` are the same, then we can consider the blocks to be equal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing class implementation

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define a new function to compare blocks based on mgr_locs
        def block_content_equal(block1, block2):
            return block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs)
        
        # Sort the blocks based on content and compare them
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        return all(
            block_content_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as equal. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
