### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the equality of two BlockManager instances by checking if they have the same number of axes, if each axis is equal, and if their blocks are equal.
2. The bug reported on GitHub suggests that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug might occur due to the way block comparison is handled, as it currently sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations without considering the actual content of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks based on type name and manager locations in the `canonicalize` function. This sorting method may cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered as equal, resulting in a `True` return value even when the blocks are not actually the same.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of just sorting them based on type name and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the blocks directly without sorting them, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and correctly return `False` when the blocks have different locations.
