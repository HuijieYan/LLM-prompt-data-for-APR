### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two block managers for equality. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified Errors:
1. The bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function, where it falsely returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are identical.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison logic in the `equals` function does not properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic compares the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block._mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare block values instead of locations
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function now compares the block values directly instead of relying on block locations. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies identical blocks with different locations as unequal.

By fixing the comparison logic in the `equals` function with this corrected version, the bug reported on GitHub should be resolved.
