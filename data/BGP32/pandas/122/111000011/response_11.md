## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class.
2. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the way block order is not canonicalized properly.
3. The buggy function is comparing blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to properly canonicalize the block order based on type name and locations before comparing the blocks.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block length and type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (len(block.mgr_locs), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a `canonicalize()` function that considers the length of block locations and block type name to properly order the blocks before comparing them. This will ensure that blocks are compared correctly even if their locations differ, fixing the issue reported on GitHub.
