### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
  
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `equals()` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This indicates a bug in the comparison logic that fails to consider block locations.

### Potential Error Location:
The error in the buggy function is likely in the comparison logic, specifically in the block comparison part where `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and then compared using `equals()`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks without considering their actual locations. Sorting by data types and manager locations is not sufficient to ensure equality, especially when blocks could have different locations but contain identical data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals()` function needs to be modified to consider both block content and location. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks based on their content first and then verifying the equality of their locations.

### Bug-fixed Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function that addresses the bug by considering both block content and location for equality comparison:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Update canonicalize function to also consider index i.e. location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now includes the index of the block to consider both content and location for comparison. This modification ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
