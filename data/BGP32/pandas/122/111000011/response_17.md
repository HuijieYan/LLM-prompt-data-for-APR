### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The bug arises because the comparison of blocks is based on their order, and not their content.
- The `canonicalize` function used to compare blocks does not consider the actual values of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks.
- Compare the actual content of the blocks in addition to their types and locations.
- This should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to compare actual values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().sum(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now considers the sum of values in each block.
- It ensures that two identical blocks with different locations are identified as not equal.
- The comparison now takes into account both the block types and their content.
