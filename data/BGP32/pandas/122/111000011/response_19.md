## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is compared with another `BlockManager` object to check if they are equal.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Error Location:
The issue is likely with the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The blocks are sorted based on `canonicalize` function which combines the type name and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same content but different locations, they may be considered unequal due to the sorting.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing blocks based on the type name and mgr_locs, which may not be suitable for identifying blocks with identical content but different locations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using sorting to compare blocks, we can compare them based on content equality directly.
2. Remove the sorting by `canonicalize` and compare the blocks without considering their locations.
3. If the lengths of the blocks are already checked, a direct comparison of blocks should be sufficient to determine equality.

## Corrected Function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks and directly compares them based on their content. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
