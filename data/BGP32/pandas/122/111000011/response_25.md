### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing blocks for equality. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns true in case of identical blocks with different locations.
2. The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects called `self` and `other`. It checks if the axes of both objects are equal, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks present in both objects. However, the bug lies in how it handles block comparisons.
3. The bug is caused by the function not considering the order and location of blocks when comparing them. This leads to `equals()` incorrectly returning `True` when blocks in `self` and `other` have different locations but are otherwise identical.
4. To fix the bug, the function should sort the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparing them. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as unequal.

### Fixing the Bug:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on data type and locations using the `canonicalize()` function, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly in the comparison. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
