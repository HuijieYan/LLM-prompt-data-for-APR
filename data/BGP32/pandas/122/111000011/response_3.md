### Analyzing the Buggy Function

- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares the equality of two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and corresponding blocks.
- The bug seems to be related to not considering the order of blocks when checking for equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
- The GitHub issue provided indicates that the `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` in a scenario where it should return `False`.
- The issue involves identical blocks with different locations.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The bug may occur in the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function.
2. The `canonicalize()` function might not be appropriately handling the sorting order of blocks.
3. The discrepancy in block locations should be addressed to ensure correct comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the way blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals()` function. If the order of blocks is not considered when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, it can lead to incorrect results. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are correctly sorted and compared. One way to address this issue is to consider the order of blocks when checking for equality. We can modify the comparison logic to handle scenarios where the block locations are different but the contents are identical.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The blocks are sorted based on the `dtype.name`, `mgr_locs`, and `values` to ensure a proper canonicalization.
- When comparing blocks, both the contents and the locations are considered to account for scenarios where blocks are identical but at different positions.

By making these changes, the `equals()` function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are present and return the expected results.
