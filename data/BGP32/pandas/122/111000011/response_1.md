### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals()` function.
2. The `equals()` function compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The bug is likely caused by not considering the differences in the locations of identical blocks during the equality comparison.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug would involve considering the block locations in addition to the content of the blocks when comparing them for equality.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals()` function, the `canonicalize()` function now considers the block locations along with the block content for comparison. The equality check in the final return statement also includes the comparison of block locations.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are treated as unequal.
