### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks from two different instances of the class to determine if they are equal.
- The comparison involves sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations, which may lead to incorrect results if the blocks have identical data but different locations.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `equals` method sorts and compares blocks based on their type names and locations, which can result in incorrect equality checks when the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider the data within the blocks rather than just their type names and locations.
- We should compare the actual data within each block to determine if they are equal, irrespective of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we compare the actual data within each block in the `equals` method by directly calling the `equals` method on the blocks, rather than relying on sorting them based on type names and locations.
- This change ensures that the comparison is based on the block's data content, leading to a more accurate determination of equality between different instances of `BlockManager`.

By implementing this corrected version, the issue reported on GitHub where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations should be resolved.
