## Analysis:
The buggy function `BlockManager.equals()` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is a clear indication that the comparison logic within the function is faulty.

## Error location:
The bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals()` function. The function sorts the blocks based on their types and location, but this sorting mechanism does not guarantee proper comparison between blocks with identical data but different locations.

## Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the faulty block comparison logic in the `equals()` function. When sorting the blocks, the function uses a `canonicalize()` function to create a tuple representing the block type and location. However, this tuple does not accurately distinguish between blocks with identical data but different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic within the `equals()` function. Instead of relying solely on the block type and location, we should compare the actual data within the blocks to determine equality. One way to achieve this is by comparing each individual element within the block data to ensure they are identical.

## Corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on actual data
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version of the `equals()` function:
1. We compare the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks early to ensure proper comparison.
2. We directly iterate over the blocks and compare their data using the `equals()` method of each block to ensure accurate equality checking.
3. If any block comparison fails, we return `False` immediately.
4. If all block comparisons pass, we return `True`.

This corrected version of the `equals()` function should accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their individual block data.
