### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The bug reported on GitHub suggests that the function returns `True` even when the blocks have identical content but are at different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparing. This sorting can result in different orderings even if the block content is the same.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to directly check for equality of block content without considering their location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the block comparison logic within the `equals` function to directly compare block content rather than sorting them based on type name and manager locations.
2. Use a more straightforward comparison method to compare the blocks in a pair-wise manner.
3. Once the content of corresponding blocks is determined to be equal, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
4. Update the documentation and comments for clarity and traceability.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now compare the block content directly, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
