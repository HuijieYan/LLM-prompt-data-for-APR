### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is `equals(self, other)`.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug reported on GitHub suggests that the `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly when there are identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug seems to originate from the comparison of blocks without considering their locations properly.
5. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their types and manager locations to handle unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not correctly capture and consider differences in block locations when sorting the blocks. This results in identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, leading to an incorrect equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also incorporate block locations in the sorting process. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not considered equal during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by both type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the modified version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the manager locations as bytes to uniquely identify blocks, ensuring that the equality comparison considers block content along with their exact locations.
