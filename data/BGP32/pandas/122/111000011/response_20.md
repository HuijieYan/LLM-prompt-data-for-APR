### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` (self and other) for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
- The bug reported on GitHub states that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The issue provided a code sample that validates the bug by comparing two data frames with different values but the same columns.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the different locations of the blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises because the function sorts the blocks based on their data type and location.
- If two blocks are identical in content but stored at different locations, the comparison fails because of the sorting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data type for sorting the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic to ignore the block location when checking equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now only returns the data type of the block for sorting, ignoring the block locations.
- The comparison in the last line of the `equals` function does not take block locations into account, focusing only on the content of the blocks.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their block content, even if the blocks are stored at different locations.
