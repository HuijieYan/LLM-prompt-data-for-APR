Based on the GitHub issue provided, the bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The issue comes from the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their type name and locations in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also take into account the unique identifier of each block. We can achieve this by adding an additional parameter to the tuple returned by `canonicalize` function. We can use the block's `mgr_locs` attribute as a unique identifier for each block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and hash
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the hash of the block values (converted to bytes) as part of the tuple. This ensures that even if the blocks have the same type name and locations, the comparison is made using a unique identifier based on the block's values.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now return the correct result as expected and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
