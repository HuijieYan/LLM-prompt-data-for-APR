### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and contents.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.
3. The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares blocks based on their canonical form that includes the data type name and the locations of the blocks. Since the locations differ for identical blocks, the comparison falsely indicates equality.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to focus on the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version above, we remove the sorting of the blocks based on their canonical form before comparison. This change ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their locations. The function now correctly compares the blocks and returns the appropriate result as expected in the GitHub issue.
