**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their attributes, such as axes, blocks, and block content.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True for cases where two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks but different locations.

**Error Locations:**
1. The bug may arise when comparing blocks using the `equals` method without considering block locations.

**Bug Cause:**
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because it does not correctly handle cases where two `BlockManager` objects have identical blocks with different locations. The function compares the content of the blocks but fails to account for the discrepancy in block locations.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider blocks with identical content but different locations as not equal. We can achieve this by incorporating block locations into the comparison process.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the blocks and their locations using the `equals` method. This modification ensures that the `equals` function considers both block content and location when determining the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
