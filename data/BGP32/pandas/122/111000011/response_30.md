### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
- The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine equality.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when two `DataFrame` instances have identical blocks but different locations, the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False`.
- The bug seems to be in the logic of comparing blocks based on their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic of comparing blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which is not taking into account the actual data values in the blocks but rather relies on the block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should take into account the actual data values within the blocks rather than just the locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_numeric_data().to_numpy()
    other_blocks = other.get_numeric_data().to_numpy()
    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function directly converts the data within the blocks to numpy arrays and compares them using `np.array_equal()` for a proper comparison. This change ensures that the actual data values within the blocks are compared for equality.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the function wrongly returned `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
