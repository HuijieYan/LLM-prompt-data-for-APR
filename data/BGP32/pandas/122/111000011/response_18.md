### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The bug reported on GitHub states that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The problem occurs because the function sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on block type and locations, which may lead to wrong results when comparing identical blocks located differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function for `BlockManager` objects compares blocks based on their type and locations. This sorting based on locations can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks located differently.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality comparison logic by not sorting the blocks based on locations, as it leads to incorrect comparisons. Instead, the comparison should focus on the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting based on block locations and compares the blocks directly. This change ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified even if they are located differently, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
