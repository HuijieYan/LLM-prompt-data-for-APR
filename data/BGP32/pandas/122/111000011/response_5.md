### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
- The purpose of the `equals` function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they are equal based on axes, block count, and block data equality.
- The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing `DataFrame` blocks with different locations but identical data.

### Identified issue:
- The bug arises from the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method without considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because in the `equals` function, the blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, this sorting may lead to incorrect comparison results when identical blocks have different locations.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug, we can refactor the comparison logic in the `equals` function to explicitly handle cases where identical blocks exist but have different locations. We should compare the blocks based on their actual data, not just the dtype name and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the actual block data in a loop and return `False` if any block pair is not equal. This approach ensures that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their dtype names and locations.
