### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The GitHub issue indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method returns True even when the blocks have identical data but potentially different locations.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations.
4. The proposed fix should involve a modification in the comparison logic of the blocks to consider their contents rather than just their order.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for the actual content of the blocks, not just their order.
2. Consider modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block content for comparison.
3. Ensure that the comparison between blocks considers the data they hold, not just their positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the canonicalize function to include content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to add block content, the comparison in the `equals` function will now correctly identify when two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks with different locations, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
