### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.
3. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare blocks based on their data type and location.
4. The bug is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the blocks have different locations but identical content.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The bug causes the function to return `True` when the block content is identical but their location is different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function takes into account both the content and the location of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and the actual block for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared based on both their content and location, fixing the bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered equal.
