The bug in the `equals` function arises when determining if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The issue stems from comparing blocks based on their `dtype`, which causes inconsistencies when blocks have the same data types but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the comparison mechanism for blocks to consider the actual values within each block, rather than solely the data type.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the values of each block using the `equals` method, ensuring that we are checking for data equality and not just the data type. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by accurately determining the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
