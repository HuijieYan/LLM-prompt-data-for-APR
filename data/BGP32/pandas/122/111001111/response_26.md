### Bug Explanation:

The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking the equality of their axes, consolidating the blocks in place, and then comparing the blocks for equality.

The bug occurs because during the comparison of blocks, the function is not handling identical blocks with different locations correctly. This leads to the method wrongly returning `True` when comparing `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. We should compare the blocks based on their content instead of relying on their locations. By sorting the blocks before comparison based on their content, we can ensure that the method returns the correct result for `equals` comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.get_dtype(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` function now takes into account the contents, dtype, and locations of the blocks. By using `get_values().tobytes()` to compare the block contents, `get_dtype()` to compare the block data type, and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to handle different block locations, we ensure a proper comparison of blocks for equality. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
