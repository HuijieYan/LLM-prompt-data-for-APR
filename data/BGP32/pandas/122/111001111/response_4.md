### Bug explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is incorrectly identifying two BlockManager instances as equals when they have identical blocks but with different locations. The bug arises from the sorting of blocks for comparison based on a canonicalize function using block dtype name and manager locations. Because the manager locations can differ even for identical blocks, the comparison evaluates to True incorrectly.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their sorting order. We should compare the blocks directly without relying on sorting based on dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks` using the `equals` method of the Block object to check for equality based on their values. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their sorting order.
