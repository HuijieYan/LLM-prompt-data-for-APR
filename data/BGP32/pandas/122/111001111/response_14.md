The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the function mistakenly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are identical in content.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than just their identity. We can modify the comparison logic by comparing the actual data within the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_data(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_data)

    return all(
        block_data(block) == block_data(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we sort the blocks by their actual data content before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than just their identity.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly return `False` when the blocks have different locations but the same content. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
