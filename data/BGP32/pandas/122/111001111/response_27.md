### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances containing identical blocks but with different locations, leading to an incorrect `True` return value.

The problematic code section is where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple with the block's dtype name and manager locations as an array. Due to this sorting, even when the blocks are the same but in different locations, they are considered different, leading to a false comparison result.

The return value of `equals` is determined by comparing corresponding blocks in the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorted order may differ if blocks are located differently, causing the comparison to fail even when the blocks are actually the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on a canonical key, we should directly compare corresponding blocks based on their locations, without enforcing a specific order.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_dict = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_dict = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in other.blocks}

    if set(self_block_dict.keys()) != set(other_block_dict.keys()):
        return False

    return all(
        self_block_dict[loc].equals(other_block_dict[loc]) 
        for loc in self_block_dict
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares blocks based on their manager locations, ensuring that the comparison is not affected by different block locations within the `BlockManager` instances.
