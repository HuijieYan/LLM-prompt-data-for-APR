The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the way block equality is checked, specifically when sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The bug causes identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly marked as equal. To fix this issue, the function needs to consider block locations when comparing blocks for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block values and locator info
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]

        if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
            return False

        if not self_block.mgr_locs.equals(other_block.mgr_locs):
            return False

        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each pair of blocks in `self` and `other`. We compare the dtype, the `mgr_locs`, and the block values to ensure that the blocks are truly equal, considering the block locations as well.

This modification ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly identified as unequal, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
