The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to comparing blocks in a specific order. The bug arises when trying to compare the blocks by their dtype and location using `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Since the order of blocks might be different due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data types, the comparison may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison approach for blocks. Instead of sorting the blocks directly and comparing them, we can create a mapping of block information (dtype and location) and then compare the mappings. This way, the comparison will be consistent regardless of the block order. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a mapping of block information (dtype and location)
    def create_block_mapping(blocks):
        return {(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()): block for block in blocks}

    self_mapping = create_block_mapping(self.blocks)
    other_mapping = create_block_mapping(other.blocks)

    # Compare the block mappings
    if self_mapping.keys() != other_mapping.keys():
        return False

    for key in self_mapping.keys():
        if not self_mapping[key].equals(other_mapping[key]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report by ensuring a proper comparison of blocks' content without being affected by their order.
