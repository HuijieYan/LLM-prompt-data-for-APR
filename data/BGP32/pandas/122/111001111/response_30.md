### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison method used for the `blocks` attribute of `BlockManager`. The function compares the blocks based on a sorting criterion that includes the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This comparison can lead to incorrect results when multiple blocks have the same dtype name but different `mgr_locs`. The bug causes the function to wrongly return True even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison mechanism for the `blocks`. Instead of relying solely on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the blocks directly to ensure that their content is identical.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks directly ensures that the content of the blocks is compared accurately, fixing the issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
