The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of BlockManager and check if they are equal. The bug is caused by not considering the possibility that identical blocks may have different locations. This inconsistency leads to incorrect returns of True when the blocks are actually different due to location discrepancies. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for blocks with different locations but identical content. We should focus on comparing the actual data in the blocks rather than the order of the blocks. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = list(map(lambda block: (block.values, block.shape), self.blocks))
    other_blocks = list(map(lambda block: (block.values, block.shape), other.blocks))

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we compare the values and shapes of the blocks to determine equality, rather than relying on the block locations. This approach addresses the issue of identical blocks with different locations causing incorrect returns.

By implementing this new comparison logic, the `equals` function should now return the expected result and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
