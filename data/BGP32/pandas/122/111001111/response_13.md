### Bug Explanation
The bug identified in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of blocks between two instances. The issue occurs when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations. One potential solution is to sort the blocks based on their content and then compare them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on dtype and content to handle different location scenarios
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now sorts blocks based on their `dtype` and content, allowing for a proper comparison even in scenarios where blocks have the same data but different locations. This adjustment ensures that the function returns the correct result based on content rather than position.
