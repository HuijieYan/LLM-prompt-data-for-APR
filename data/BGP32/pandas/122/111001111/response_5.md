### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal. The issue arises when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function first sorts the blocks based on their type and location, then iterates over these sorted blocks to check for equality. However, in the comparison process, the function fails to properly compare blocks with the same content but different locations, resulting in a false equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle blocks with the same content but different locations. We should focus on comparing the actual block content rather than their order or location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs))
  
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modify the sorting process to consider both the content (`values`) and locations (`mgr_locs`) of the blocks for comparison. This adjustment ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
