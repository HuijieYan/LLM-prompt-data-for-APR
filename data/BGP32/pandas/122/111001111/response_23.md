### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug causes the function to return True incorrectly when the blocks have identical data but different locations within the internal data structure.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to properly handle the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations. One approach is to compare the block data itself instead of relying on the block locations. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects and comparing their data directly.

### Corrected Function

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates over the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects and compares the blocks directly using the `equals` method defined for each block type. This comparison ensures that the function correctly identifies when the blocks have identical data regardless of their locations.
