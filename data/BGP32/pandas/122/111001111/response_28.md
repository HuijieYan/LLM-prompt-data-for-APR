### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the block comparison logic doesn't account for the different locations of identical blocks. The code sorts the blocks based on the type name and location, assuming that identical blocks should have the same location. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, if the blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison wrongly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be updated to consider identical blocks with different locations as not equal. One possible approach is to compare the actual data in the blocks while maintaining the block order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if set(self_blocks_dict.keys()) != set(other_blocks_dict.keys()):
        return False

    for key in self_blocks_dict:
        if not self_blocks_dict[key].equals(other_blocks_dict[key]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the identical blocks based on the actual data they contain and maintains the block order while considering them as equal. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not be falsely identified as equal.
