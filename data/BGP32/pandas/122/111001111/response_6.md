### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `equals`, the bug occurs because the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not correctly considering identical blocks with different locations. The function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block attributes, but this sorting does not consider the block locations. Therefore, even if the blocks are identical, but they are located differently, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function to handle blocks with identical contents but different locations. One possible approach is to sort the blocks based on content comparison instead of only attribute comparison. By comparing the actual data in the blocks, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies differences in block locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function based on the bug fix strategy mentioned above:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to compare block content
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Sort blocks based on content comparison
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x.get_values(), x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as different, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
