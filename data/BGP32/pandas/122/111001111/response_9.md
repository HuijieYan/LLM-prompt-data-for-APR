Looking at the buggy function `equals` and the provided runtime and expected values, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not functioning correctly, leading to incorrect equality checks.

The problem arises when comparing the blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, as the comparison is only based on the current order, which may not reflect the actual equality of the blocks. It does not consider the block locations, which leads to incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider their content and locations. One way to address this is to compare the blocks based on their content and location combined. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate information about block locations for a more accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating block locations into the comparison, this corrected version should provide accurate equality checks for blocks with identical content but different locations. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the `equals` function works as expected when comparing DataFrames.
