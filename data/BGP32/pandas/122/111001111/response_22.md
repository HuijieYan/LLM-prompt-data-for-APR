### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a set of criteria for canonicalization. It then checks if each block in `self_blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. The issue is that the `canonicalize` function that determines the sorting key includes the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not directly comparable, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the key used for sorting the blocks to remove the `mgr_locs` attribute from consideration, as comparing blocks based on `mgr_locs` can cause inconsistencies in the results. We can focus on using the `dtype.name` for sorting and comparison, which is more reliable for block comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name 
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values_hash

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we changed the `canonicalize` function to consider `block.values_hash` for determining the sorting key instead of `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a more reliable criterion for comparison, addressing the issue caused by incorrect sorting.
