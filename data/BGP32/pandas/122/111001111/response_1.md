### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the issue arises when comparing the blocks, especially when they have identical content but different locations, causing the function to wrongly return `True`.
2. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs to distinguish between them.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify blocks as equal even when their locations differ. This leads to the function returning `True` instead of `False` for cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison logic to ensure that blocks with the same content are not falsely identified as equal.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.to_native_types()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. The revised `canonicalize` function now includes the block's locations and their native types in the tuple being sorted, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
2. By including both location and content in the sorting comparison, we maintain consistency in identifying truly equal blocks while accounting for location differences.
3. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by correcting the comparison logic in the `equals` function.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now accurately determine equality between two `BlockManager` objects, fixing the issue where blocks with different locations were falsely identified as equal.
