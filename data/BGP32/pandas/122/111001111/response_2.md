## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class in pandas by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The issue arises when the blocks have the same content but different locations. The comparison should consider the content and not the exact locations of the blocks.

### Error Location
The key issue lies in how the `equals` function compares the blocks by iterating over them and checking for equality. It does not take into account the possibility of blocks having the same content but different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks based solely on their order and location, leading to a false positive when blocks have the same data but are positioned differently in the `BlockManager`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison mechanism of the blocks. Instead of relying on the order of the blocks in the `BlockManager`, we should compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, we sort the blocks based on their content before comparing them for equality. This ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
