### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function, specifically when extracting `mgr_locs` from the block.
3. The bug results in incorrectly identifying blocks as equal even when they have different locations.
4. This issue is reflected in the GitHub bug report, where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to include better criteria for block comparison, ensuring location information is considered.
2. Update the comparison logic to accurately compare blocks based on their content and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)  # Update canonicalize to consider block values and locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block values along with locations, the `equals` function should now correctly identify differing blocks with different locations as unequal. This fix addresses the issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
