#### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by a comparison that mistakenly returns `True` when it should return `False` due to identical blocks with different locations. The function compares the blocks in `self` and `other` by sorting them based on a canonicalized order calculated using the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

However, the bug arises when trying to canonicalize the blocks because the `BlockPlacement` object's actual data is not considered. This leads to a situation where blocks with the same characteristics but different locations are incorrectly marked as equal.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the canonicalization mechanism needs to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just the dtype and locations. This can be achieved by comparing the block data directly in addition to the dtype and location. 

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the block data is considered in the canonicalization process, providing a more accurate comparison.
