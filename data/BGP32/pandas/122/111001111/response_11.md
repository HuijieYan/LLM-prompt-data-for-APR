The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The function incorrectly returns True even when the blocks have different locations but are identical, leading to false positives in equality checks.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic of blocks. The function `block.equals(oblock)` compares blocks based on their attributes but fails to consider the block locations. Since blocks can have different locations even when their content is the same, this leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their attributes. We can achieve this by comparing the data within the blocks instead of comparing the blocks themselves.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks are equal
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block._try_cast(oblock.values), oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function compares the actual data values within each block using `np.array_equal()` to determine equality. This approach ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly considered equal.

By updating the `equals` function in this way, the bug reported in the GitHub issue will be resolved, and the function will return the correct results for equality checks.
