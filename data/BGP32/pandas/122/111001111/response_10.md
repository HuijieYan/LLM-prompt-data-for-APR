The bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by comparing blocks in different order without considering their actual content. In the provided code snippet, the comparison of blocks is done after sorting them based on their dtype name and the manager locations, which can lead to incorrect results when the blocks have identical content but differ in their locations.

To fix this issue, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of their order after sorting. Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Create a dictionary to store block-dtype pairs for quick lookup
    self_block_dict = {(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()): block for block in self_blocks}
    
    for oblock in other_blocks:
        block_key = (oblock.dtype.name, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
        if block_key not in self_block_dict or not self_block_dict[block_key].equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we use a dictionary to quickly lookup blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. We then compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality, ensuring that blocks with identical content are correctly identified.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where `equals()` wrongly returned `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
