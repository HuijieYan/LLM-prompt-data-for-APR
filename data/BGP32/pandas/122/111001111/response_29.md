## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` object. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect results due to blocks being considered equal even if they have different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function. Instead of solely relying on sorting blocks by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the blocks directly based on their content and positions.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` to ensure that they are equal based on content and positions. This approach fixes the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
