### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations but with the same content. The comparison based on block locations may incorrectly return False when two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, causing the function to return True when False was expected. This behavior contradicts the intended logic and leads to erroneous results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To correct this bug, we should modify the comparison mechanism so that block equality is determined based on block content rather than block locations. By ignoring the block locations during comparison, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies identical blocks regardless of their positions within the DataFrame.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug by considering block content for comparison rather than block locations.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__hash__(),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version compares blocks based on the content's hash value using `block.values.__hash__()`, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and accurate regardless of the block's location within the DataFrame. This modification resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
