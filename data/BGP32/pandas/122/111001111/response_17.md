### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two objects by their axes and block content.
2. The bug arises from the comparison logic where the blocks are not correctly compared due to potentially different locations.
3. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks.
4. The comparison using `complex` objects like blocks with dtype and locations can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for comparing blocks is robust and accounts for potential differences in block order or location.
2. Consider modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly identify and compare blocks.
3. Focus on comparing the actual data content of the blocks rather than relying solely on dtype and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks based on data content
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By enhancing the block comparison logic to include the actual data content of the blocks, the corrected function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` objects and provide accurate results as expected.
