The bug in the `equals` function arises because the function does not consider the block locations when comparing blocks. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations. The function needs to include the block locations while comparing blocks to address this issue.

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate block locations. We can achieve this by including the block's location along with the block's dtype in the tuple for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block's locations into the comparison in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected `equals` function now considers block locations as well, ensuring that it correctly handles cases where identical blocks have different locations. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
