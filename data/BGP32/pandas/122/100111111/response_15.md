### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` with columns in different order and expects them to be not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that it expected `False` but received `True`.
4. The runtime values and types of variables inside the function show that the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances matters for comparison, but the function does not handle this correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `equals` does not account for the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances during comparison. It only checks if the blocks themselves are equal, not considering their relative positions.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are sorted and compared in the same order. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version sorts the blocks based on both their type name and `mgr_locs` before comparing them. This ensures that blocks in both instances are in the same order for comparison, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should now correctly identify that `df1` and `df2` are not equal as intended in the failing test.
