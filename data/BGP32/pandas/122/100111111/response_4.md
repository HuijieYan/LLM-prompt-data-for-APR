### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. If the lengths of their axes are different, it returns False. Then, it checks if every axis is equal using the `equals` method, consolidates the blocks, and compares each block in order.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in corresponding cells are mistakenly determined as equal by the `equals` function.

3. Based on the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the issue is due to the incorrect sorting of blocks based on the combination of type name and locations before the comparison. The incorrect sorting makes the block comparison unreliable, leading to wrong equality results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect canonicalization and sorting of blocks for comparison. Since the blocks are sorted based on a combination of type name and locations, if the block locations are not consistent even for identical values, sorting based on this can result in incorrect comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is crucial to sort the blocks in a more reliable manner for comparison. Instead of relying on both type name and locations, sorting based solely on type name can resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block type name for reliable sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks solely based on type name for canonicalization and comparison, the corrected function should now correctly identify differences between DataFrame blocks with different values.
