### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. If the lengths of the axes are not equal or if any corresponding axes do not match, it returns `False`. However, the comparison of the blocks relies on sorting them by their type name and manager locations, which might lead to incorrect results.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' populated in different order. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.

3. The error message indicates that the assertion `True is False` fails, which suggests that the comparison within the `equals()` function is returning `True` incorrectly.

4. The runtime values inside the function show that the variables are handled correctly, but the comparison logic for blocks can lead to inconsistent results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks in the `equals()` function. Sorting by type name and manager locations may not be sufficient to distinguish between different blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals()` function to consider the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    for idx in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[idx].equals(other_blocks[idx]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After applying this fix, the `equals()` function will correctly compare the blocks by their content rather than relying on sorting by type names and manager locations. This correction should resolve the issue indicated in the failing test case and align with the expected behavior.
