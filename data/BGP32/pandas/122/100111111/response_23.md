### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different types and then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be False.
3. From the runtime values provided, the function fails to correctly identify the inequality between the two `BlockManager` objects due to the different locations of the blocks.
4. The buggy function erroneously returns True even when the blocks have different locations despite the axes being the same.
5. The GitHub issue confirms this bug where the `equals` method does not behave as expected when dealing with identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to consider not only block equality but also their positions. Here's a proposed corrected version of the function:

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `mgr_locs` attribute within the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version ensures that the comparison accounts for the block locations in addition to their properties. This modification should address the issue and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
