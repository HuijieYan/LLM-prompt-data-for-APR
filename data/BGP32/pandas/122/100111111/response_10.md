### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. It first checks if their axes have the same length, then checks if all corresponding axes are equal using the `equals` method. If not, it returns `False`. It then consolidates both `self` and `other` before comparing the lengths of their blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function and compares each block for equality.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with columns `a` and `b` having different values. It asserts that the `equals` method should return `False` for these dataframes.
   
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` method wrongly returned `True` instead of `False`.
   
4. The runtime values show that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain the blocks to be compared, and the sorting based on the canonicalization function might not correctly handle blocks with different values but same type and location.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Based on the analysis, the bug seems to be related to the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly even if they have different locations within the dataframes. One way to address this is to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use the block values for comparison rather than their locations, the corrected version of the function should now correctly compare the blocks and return the expected output for the failing test.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
