### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects representing DataFrames. The issue arises when the order of blocks inside the `BlockManager` varies due to different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with swapped columns, expecting them to be unequal. However, due to the order of blocks inside the `BlockManager`, the equality check fails.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, showcasing that the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to normalize the order of blocks before comparing them in the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from different block orderings in the `BlockManager` objects, leading to false positives in the equality check.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects based on a canonical method before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # normalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items[0], block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical method, the corrected function ensures consistent ordering before performing the equality check. This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub and makes the function return the correct results for the failing test.
