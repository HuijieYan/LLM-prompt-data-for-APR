### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function checks if the `axes` of the two objects are of the same length and all the corresponding axes' equality using `equals` method. After that, it consolidates both objects in-place and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares each block within the two `BlockManager` objects.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different data types but equivalent values for each column. The test expects the `equals` method to return `False` for these DataFrames, as they are not identical.

3. The failing test error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it evaluates to `True is False`.

4. The bug in the function arises from not taking into account the data types of the blocks while comparing them. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, which can lead to incorrect comparisons for DataFrames with similar values but different data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to also include checking the data types of the blocks. This will ensure that DataFrames with the same values but different data types are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function includes the data type of each block while comparing them, resolving the issue of considering DataFrames with the same values but different data types as equal. This correction aligns with the expected behavior defined in the failing test.
