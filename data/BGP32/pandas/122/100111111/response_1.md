### Issue Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` when the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have different values or structures.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because `True is False`, meaning the `equals` function returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The variables `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` represent the axes and blocks of the dataframes, leading to comparison discrepancies in the buggy function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights an identical blocks issue that causes incorrect return values in the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to improperly compare two dataframes due to the improper handling of axes and block comparisons. This behavior results in the function returning `True` when it should return `False`, as seen in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs adjustment to correctly identify differences between the two dataframes based on their structure and values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__hash__(),)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function improves the comparison logic using a proper hashing mechanism to identify differences between blocks. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should pass the failing test case.
