### Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns interchanged and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The runtime and expected values of the function's variables indicate that the `canonicalize` function might not handle block comparison correctly, leading to the wrong outcome.
5. The GitHub issue specifically mentions this bug where `equals` returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function doesn't handle the block comparison accurately, especially when the block locations differ. This issue causes the incorrect comparison result, leading to the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle block comparison, considering not only the dtype name but also the block locations. By updating the `canonicalize` function to incorporate block locations into the comparison, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly distinguished, resolving the bug.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test, accurately comparing DataFrames based on both dtype and block locations.
