### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects, specifically checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `'a'` and `'b'` in a different order in each DataFrame, expecting `equals` to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that `True` is being returned instead of `False`.
4. The runtime and expected variable values provided indicate that the issue might be related to how the sorting of blocks for comparison is handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug disallows correct comparison due to the incorrect handling of sorting blocks based on their type and locations. If the `blocks` within the `BlockManager` objects are identical but have different locations, the function erroneously returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic so that blocks are adequately compared without being influenced by their locations. This involves sorting blocks based on a unique identifier that doesn't depend on the internal structure.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # canonicalize block order based on block type only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the data type only and not on their locations, we prevent the comparison from being influenced by the internal structure of the `BlockManager` blocks. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
