### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
- In the failing test case, `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to return `False` since the data in the `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` do not match.
- The error message shows that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion failure.

### Issues:
- The buggy function likely fails to correctly compare the content of the `BlockManager` blocks due to differences in block locations.
- The comparison sorting based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` may not be sufficient to distinguish blocks with the same content but different locations accurately.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug:
1. Revise the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their names and locations.
2. Ensure a comprehensive comparison mechanism that accurately identifies differences in block content.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.values()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.values()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function directly compares the content of blocks using the `values()` method to extract the blocks from the `BlockManager`. This change ensures an accurate comparison of the block data, addressing the issue with block locations affecting the equality check.
