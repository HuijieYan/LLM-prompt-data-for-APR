### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManagers and their corresponding axes and blocks for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames that should be unequal but the function incorrectly returns True.
2. The buggy function mistakenly compares the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` which leads to the incorrect result.
3. The cause of the bug is the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function which is not the correct approach for comparison. This results in the function returning True when it should be False. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the function returns True instead of False.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare individual blocks directly instead of sorting and comparing them. This way, we can ensure that the equality comparison is accurate.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
``` 

By directly comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting, we ensure that each block is compared accurately which should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
