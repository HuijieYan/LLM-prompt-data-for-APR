### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. It compares the axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves, sorting them based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with columns `'a'` and `'b'`, but the values are in reversed orders. It asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails.

3. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` which indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

4. The bug lies in the logic of the `canonicalize` function and how it handles the equality check between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The issue arises due to the way block sorting is done based on type name and `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function. We need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, considering the order of the elements in the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of block dtype name and mgr_locs without converting mgr_locs to a list.
- When comparing blocks, it compares the block values directly instead of relying on `equals` method, which ensures correct comparison of block values.
