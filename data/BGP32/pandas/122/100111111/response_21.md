### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with similar data but different column order and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
   
2. The comparison logic in the buggy function is flawed because it only considers the order of the blocks when checking for equality, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True` for dataframes with different column orders.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the actual data within the blocks and not just their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Check equality of blocks taking data into consideration
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual values within the blocks (`block.values`) instead of just their order, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal due to differences in data and column order.
