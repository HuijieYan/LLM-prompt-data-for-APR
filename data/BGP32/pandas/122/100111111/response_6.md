### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks using a canonicalization process. The bug lies in the canonicalization based on the `block` variable, where `block.mgr_locs` is used to sort the blocks. This causes the comparison to fail erroneously due to different locations of identical blocks.
   
2. The failing test tries to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have identical data but different column orders. The expected behavior is for the `equals` method to return `False` indicating that the DataFrames are not equal due to the column order difference.

3. The error message points out that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because `True` is not equal to `False`. This occurs because the buggy `equals` method wrongly reports the equality between `df1` and `df2` as `True` due to the block location issue.

4. To fix the bug, we need to address the way the blocks are canonicalized and sorted. We should not consider the block locations in the canonicalization process to correctly identify the difference between DataFrames with identical data but different block locations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's data type name and removing the block's locations from the sorting process, we can now correctly identify differences between DataFrames with identical data but different block locations.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and return `False` when comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2` as expected.
