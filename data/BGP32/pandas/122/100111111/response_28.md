### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first compares the axes of the two instances, then the blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different order and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The error message asserts `True is False` due to the incorrect equality evaluation between the two `BlockManager` instances in the buggy `equals` function.
4. The bug causes the function to return `True` instead of the expected `False` in cases where blocks are compared with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function needs to be revised to account for different block locations along with the block content during equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = []
    for self_block in self.blocks:
        found_equal = False
        for other_block in other.blocks:
            if self_block.equals(other_block):
                self_blocks.append(self_block)
                other.blocks.remove(other_block)
                found_equal = True
                break
        if not found_equal:
            return False

    return len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks) == len(self_blocks)
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that each block in `self.blocks` is compared to a block in `other.blocks` considering both content and location. If a matching block is found, it is added to `self_blocks`, and the comparison continues until all blocks are matched. Finally, it verifies that all blocks were matched between the two `BlockManager` instances.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and properly compare the blocks' content and location for equality, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
