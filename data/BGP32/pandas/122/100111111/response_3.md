### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises because the blocks are being sorted based on a canonicalization function that considers the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparisons since the blocks might have identical content but differing mgr_locs.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different data types. The test expects the `equals` function to return `False` due to the data mismatch. However, the function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, causing the comparison to incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `equals` function to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their metadata. We can achieve this by comparing the values within the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting them, the corrected `equals` function will now correctly identify DataFrames with different data types as not equal. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
