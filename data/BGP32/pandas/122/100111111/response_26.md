### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. 
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns re-ordered, expecting them to be unequal using the `equals` method.
3. The error message shows an assertion failure where `True` is compared to `False`, indicating the buggy function wrongly returning `True`.
4. The runtime and expected values show that the block locations are not considered while comparing the blocks, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function compares blocks without accounting for differences in block locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
2. When comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the buggy `equals` function does not handle the block locations, causing it to wrongly return `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this bug where the equality check fails for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for determining block equality.
2. Update the comparison logic within the `equals` function to consider block locations for proper DataFrame equality checks.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs))
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating block locations in the equality comparison, the corrected function ensures proper DataFrame equality checks, fixing the bug and satisfying the GitHub issue report.
