### Explanation of the Bug
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two pandas BlockManager objects for equality. The bug arises because the function fails to properly handle block locations during the comparison. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` for cases where blocks have the same data but different locations.

Specifically, when comparing the blocks in `self` and `other`, the function sorts the blocks based on a combination of the block data type name and locations. However, the comparison process does not consider the actual data within the blocks, leading to the incorrect equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison should not only consider the block data type and locations but also compare the actual data within the blocks. By ensuring that the comparison incorporates the block data itself, the function will correctly identify cases where blocks have the same data but different locations as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Change to consider the actual block data for comparison
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to also include the block values for comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function will properly handle cases where blocks have the same data but different locations, resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
