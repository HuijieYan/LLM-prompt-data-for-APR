### Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values per column, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.
4. The runtime values of the input parameters and relevant variables indicate that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly compare the block data within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic solely relies on the order of blocks and could potentially compare different blocks as equal based on that order even if the content is different.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to handle the comparison of block content properly. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a hash based on block content rather than relying on order. This change would ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of the order.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data by creating a hash based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By creating a hash of the block values, we ensure that identical content in different blocks will be considered equal. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and handle the comparison correctly.
