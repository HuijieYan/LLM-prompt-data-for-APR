### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by iterating over their blocks. 
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that two dataframes with values `{"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]}` and `{"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]}` are not equal.
3. The failing test is due to the function returning `True` instead of `False` for the provided dataframes.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior of `equals` returning `True` for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares blocks based on their order, which is incorrect. The comparison should be based on the content of the blocks rather than their positions.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the canonicalize function to ignore block order and compare the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Comparing blocks by content
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare dataframes based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
