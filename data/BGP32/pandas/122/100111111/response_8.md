### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances, which contain different values for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison occurs based on the sorted order of blocks, but the function does not consider the content of the blocks themselves.
   
2. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with different values. However, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing these DataFrames, leading to the AssertionError.

3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, where the actual comparison involves the equality check between two DataFrames that have different content.

4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to consider the actual content of the blocks, not just the order. One way to achieve this is to compare the values within the blocks themselves before proceeding with the block sorting and comparison.

### Updated and Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare values within blocks before sorting
    def compare_block(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)  # Update this line to compare values within blocks

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if not all(compare_block(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function that compares the content of blocks before sorting, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
