### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is intended to check for equality between two blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column value order and expects them to be unequal.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, suggesting that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`.
3. The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. It then sorts and compares the blocks. The issue arises from the sorting based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks correctly based on the column labels.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column labels
    def canonicalize(block):
        return [idx for idx, col in enumerate(self.axes[0]) if col in block.items]

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should correctly compare the two `BlockManager` objects based on the column labels and pass the failing test.
