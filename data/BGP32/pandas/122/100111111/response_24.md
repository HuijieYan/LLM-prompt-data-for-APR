### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function checks the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` asserts that two DataFrames are not equal, which should return `False`. However, it fails to do so.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that `True` is returned instead of `False`.
5. The buggy function compares the blocks using a canonicalized order based on dtype and mgr_locs, but it fails to consider the actual data integrity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It sorts and compares the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs instead of the actual data values, leading to incorrect equality check results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual data values in the blocks rather than just sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual block values instead of just sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
