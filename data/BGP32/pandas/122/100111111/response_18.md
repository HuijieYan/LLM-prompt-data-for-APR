## Analysis
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two DataFrames in pandas. The bug is causing it to return `True` incorrectly even when the DataFrames are not equal.
2. The bug seems to be related to block ordering and comparison within the function.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects the `equals` function to return `False`, which it fails to do.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the function considers the actual column values rather than just the block locations.
5. Let's correct the function based on the analysis.

## Correction
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should correctly compare the DataFrames based on their actual values rather than just the block locations. This change should make the function return the expected results and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
