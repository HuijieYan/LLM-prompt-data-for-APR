### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances, checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` in different orders and expects them to be unequal.
3. The error message states that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that the function returns `True` incorrectly.
4. Based on the runtime and expected values provided, the issue seems to stem from the sorting of blocks within the function causing incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function incorrectly sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, leading to a false positive in the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the blocks are sorted based on a more reliable criterion for comparison, such as block values or indices.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def pristine_values(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=pristine_values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=pristine_values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected function should now provide the expected comparison results, passing the failing test case.
