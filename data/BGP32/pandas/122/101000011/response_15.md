### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue:

- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `managers.py` file of pandas.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The `equals` method has code to compare the blocks within two `BlockManager` objects, but the comparison logic is faulty.
- The issue expects the `equals` method to return `False` when comparing `df3` and `df4`, but it returns `True` incorrectly.

### Identified Problem in the Buggy Function:
- The issue in the `equals` method arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to standardize the blocks for comparison based on dtype and manager locations.
- Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on this standardization is incorrect, as it does not consider the actual data inside the blocks but rather the block properties.
- This causes the comparison to return `True` for DataFrames with the same data but different block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should consider the actual data content in the blocks rather than just the block properties. The order of blocks should not affect the equality result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check equality of individual blocks by matching data directly
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The comparison in the `equals` method has been modified to compare the values of individual blocks directly using the `values` attribute.
- This change ensures that the equality check considers the actual data content within the blocks rather than their properties.
- The function should now return `False` as expected for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

By applying this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the `equals` method should now correctly handle DataFrame comparisons.
