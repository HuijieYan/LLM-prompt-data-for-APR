## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their axes, blocks, and their types. The bug in the function causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This issue arises from the way the function handles block comparison.

## Error Location:
The main cause of the bug is in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize()` method. This method sorts the blocks based on the type name and manager locations, which may result in different blocks being considered equal due to different locations.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `canonicalize()` considers blocks as equal solely based on their content and not their actual position or location. Therefore, identical blocks with different locations are treated as equal, leading to the incorrect `True` result in the comparison.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison approach to consider both the content and the actual position of the blocks. Adding a unique identifier or index for each block during the comparison process can help distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their unique identifier using the `id()` function, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously considered equal. This approach ensures a proper comparison between the blocks and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
