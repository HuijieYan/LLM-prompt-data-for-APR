### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them in place, and finally comparing each block within the `BlockManager`. The issue described in the GitHub problem is that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. When sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function, the comparison does not consider differences in block locations, leading to the incorrect equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function not taking into account the unique characteristics of each block, like their locations. This leads to identical blocks being considered equal even when they have different positions in the DataFrame structure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate information about block locations along with block types. By doing this, we ensure that the comparison takes into account the complete characteristics of each block when determining equality.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison now includes checking the block locations for equality in addition to the block types. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not be considered equal.
