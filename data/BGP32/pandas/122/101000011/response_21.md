### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrect in its implementation. It fails to return `False` as expected in the GitHub issue when comparing seemingly similar DataFrames with different data types.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing blocks based on sorted lists of locations can lead to incorrect comparisons.
2. Ignoring the data type of the blocks during comparison can cause issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the use of a flawed comparison strategy in the `equals` function. Sorting blocks based on tuple combinations of data type names and locations without considering the actual block content leads to incorrect comparisons.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the block while sorting.
2. Add a check to ensure the block data types are the same before comparing.
3. Update the comparison logic to correctly identify differences between blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtypes)  # Sort based on values and data type

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function now sorts blocks based on both values and data types.
2. A check is added to compare the length of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before iterating.
3. The equality check now considers both data and data types to accurately compare blocks.

This corrected version should help resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
