### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects. 
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. Looking at the buggy function, the comparison logic does not take into account the block locations, resulting in `equals` returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to compare these locations during the equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `equals` does not include the comparison of block locations, leading to incorrect equality results when blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Include the comparison of block locations in the equality check to ensure accurate results.
2. Update the comparison logic to compare both content and locations of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by including mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals` function to include the comparison of block locations along with content, the function will now provide the correct results and address the issue reported on GitHub.
