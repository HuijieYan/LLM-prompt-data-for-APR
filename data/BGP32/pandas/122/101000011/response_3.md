### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing an issue related to the equality check of DataFrames. The specific problem arises from comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to `equals()` mistakenly returning `True` instead of `False`. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this incorrect behavior, which was not the expected output based on the provided code sample.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. Comparison of block locations using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Sorting blocks based on a tuple combining data type and locations.
3. Comparing blocks for equality without proper consideration for consolidated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the comparison logic within the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class. In the `canonicalize` function, sorting blocks using data type and locations leads to incorrect results when identical blocks are located differently. This flaw causes the equality check to return `True` for DataFrames with the same data but different block locations.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
A strategy to resolve this issue involves modifying the comparison mechanism to better handle blocks with different locations. The sorting logic should consider block identities beyond just data type and locations to accurately determine equality. Additionally, ensuring consolidated blocks are handled appropriately during the comparison process will help in eliminating false positive outcomes.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting using canonicalize
    self_blocks, other_blocks = self.blocks, other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By modifying the `equals()` function in this way, we address the issue reported on GitHub by handling identical blocks with different locations accurately. This corrected version ensures that the equality comparison returns the correct result based on the actual content of the blocks without being affected by their positions.
