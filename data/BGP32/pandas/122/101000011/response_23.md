### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects and checking if they are equal. The bug occurs when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations, leading to the incorrect result being returned.

### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function might not handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function might not be considering the block locations properly.
3. The `equals` method might not be properly identifying the equality of blocks due to the above reasons.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` function is comparing blocks based on their content only, without taking into account their actual locations. When blocks have the same content but different locations, the function incorrectly assumes them to be different.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider both content and locations of the blocks. We can achieve this by enhancing the `canonicalize` function to include block locations while sorting the blocks. This way, blocks with similar content but different locations will be treated as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include block content and locations in tuple for comparison
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now considers both the content and locations of the blocks while comparing them, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
