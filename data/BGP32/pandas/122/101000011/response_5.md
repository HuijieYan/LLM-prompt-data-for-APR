### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks from two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Location:
The bug arises in the `equals` function due to the sorting mechanism used for blocks comparison. If the blocks are identical but in different locations, they should not be considered equal. The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on their data type and location, leading to incorrect comparisons of blocks.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the `canonicalize` function, the sorting of blocks using `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` fails to differentiate between blocks that are equal in content but have different locations.
2. Due to this incorrect sorting, the `equals` function ends up comparing blocks wrongly, leading to a false equality result when blocks are in different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based only on their content, not their locations. Removing the location information from the sorting key will ensure that identical blocks are correctly compared for equality. This change should address the reported issue on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Existing code blocks

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Modify canonicalize function to sort only based on data type
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By removing the block location information from the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected code ensures that blocks are compared based solely on their content. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered equal.
