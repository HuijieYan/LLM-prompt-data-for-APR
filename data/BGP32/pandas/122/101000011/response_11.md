### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two sets of blocks within different `DataFrame` objects. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function returns `True` instead of `False` for cases where identical blocks exist but are in different locations within the data frames. The comparison in the function has to be modified to handle this case correctly.

### Identified Error:
The identified error within the `equals` function is that it does not account for cases where identical blocks exist but in different locations. The comparison is done based on sorting the blocks and comparing them one by one, leading to incorrect results for the case specified in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `equals` function doesn't consider the relative location of blocks within the `DataFrame`. When sorting the blocks and comparing them, it doesn't distinguish between identical blocks that are in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing block by block based on sorting, we need to iterate over the blocks and check if identical blocks exist in the same location within the data frame.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in other.blocks}
    
    # Check if all identical blocks exist at the same location
    for mgr_locs, block in self_blocks_dict.items():
        if mgr_locs not in other_blocks_dict or not block.equals(other_blocks_dict[mgr_locs]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, I have created dictionaries for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` with location as the key. Then, I iterate over the blocks in `self.blocks` and check if the identical block exists in the same location within `other.blocks`. This way, the comparison considers the location of blocks and returns the correct result.
