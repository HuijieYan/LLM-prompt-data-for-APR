### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks without considering their specific locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting done on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which only considers the block's datatype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This approach doesn't account for the actual content or data within the blocks, resulting in a false equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block's content or data along with the existing criteria to ensure accurate comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's actual content `block.values` along with its datatype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This modification ensures that the comparison is based on the block's complete information, leading to a correct equality evaluation.
