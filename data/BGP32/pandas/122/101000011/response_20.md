### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has a bug that leads to incorrect behavior when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` function. The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, resulting in a wrong return value.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely to occur in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function, where the function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and manager locations. This sorting mechanism, along with the subsequent comparison, can cause the bug.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the fact that the `equals` function does not consider the block locations when comparing the DataFrames. Sorting the blocks based solely on the data type name does not ensure the correct comparison if the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the block locations in addition to the data type name when comparing the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly classified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's manager locations as a part of the sorting key, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are appropriately compared. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
