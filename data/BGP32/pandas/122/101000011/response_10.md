### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is comparing blocks within two `BlockManagers` for equality.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function wrongly returns `True` even in cases where identical blocks exist but with different locations.
- The issue seems to be related to the way block locations are handled during comparison.
- In the code, the function `canonicalize()` is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.
- The issue arises because the `canonicalize()` function does not handle different block locations properly, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Error Location:
The main error in the code lies within the `canonicalize()` function. Due to the limitation of only considering dtype name and manager locations for sorting, blocks that are identical but in different locations are not handled correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the inability of the 'canonicalize()' function to distinguish between identical blocks in different locations. As a result, it can lead to incorrect equality comparisons of `BlockManagers`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals()` function returns the correct value, we need to update the `canonicalize()` function to consider all relevant block attributes for identifying them uniquely.

### Modified and Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.ftype, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the updated version, `canonicalize()` now constructs a tuple with relevant block attributes like `ftype` and `values` to ensure unique identification of blocks. This modification should address the issue and allow for correct comparison of blocks within `BlockManagers`.
