### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks in a DataFrame for equality. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a scenario where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as equal when using the `equals` function.

### Identified error locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` function does not correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.
2. The sorting of blocks based on block type and manager locations might not be sufficient to distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the buggy code snippet only checks for the equality of blocks in the same order. It does not take into consideration cases where identical blocks are present but at different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for cases where identical blocks have different locations. Updating the block comparison mechanism will allow for a more accurate determination of equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, the `equals` function now uses the class type and values of blocks to ensure a more accurate comparison. This adjustment allows for the identification of identical blocks with different locations as unequal. Additionally, sorting blocks based on these attributes enhances the process of comparing blocks for equality.

By incorporating these changes, the bug reported on GitHub regarding the inaccurate identification of identical blocks with different locations is addressed, and the `equals` function now behaves as expected.
