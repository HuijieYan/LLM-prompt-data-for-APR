### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` class.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `equals` function returns True incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The problem lies in the comparison logic considering block locations when blocks are identical.
4. The `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on type name and manager locations, potentially changing the order of blocks and causing incorrect comparison results.
5. The bug causes the `equals` function to return True incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical block content but different block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block content for sorting, not the manager locations.
- Sort the blocks based on their content only, to ensure consistent comparison results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.tobytes()
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now uses `block.values.tobytes()` to sort blocks based on their content.
- The blocks are sorted solely based on their content, ensuring that identical blocks regardless of location are correctly compared.

By making these changes, the bug causing incorrect comparison results in the `equals` function should be fixed.
