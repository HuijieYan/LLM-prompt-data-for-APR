### Analysis:
- The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method, which is supposed to determine if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal.
- The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly when the blocks have the same data but different locations.
- The issue seems to stem from how the blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` method. When comparing blocks, only the `block.equals(oblock)` is being checked without considering the block locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not take into account the block locations, only the block data type.
- As a result, when comparing the blocks later, the equality check does not consider the actual position of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block locations in addition to the data type.
- By including the block locations in the sorting key, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the `mgr_locs` of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks with the same data type but different locations are sorted accordingly. This modification fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
