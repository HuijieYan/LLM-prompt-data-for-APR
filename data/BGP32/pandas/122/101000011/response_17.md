### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` file is comparing blocks within two `BlockManager` instances by sorting them based on their types and locations. However, the comparison logic is flawed as it may incorrectly return `True` when the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize()` function based on type and locations may cause the bug.
2. The comparison using a list comprehension where the equality of `block` and `oblock` is checked may not consider identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals()` function. Identical blocks with different locations are not distinguished properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals()` function compares blocks correctly, we need to consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations. One way to achieve this is to modify the comparison logic to directly check the equality of block content instead of sorting based on locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i])
        for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare the blocks in a pairwise manner to ensure that blocks with identical content are correctly identified as equal irrespective of their locations. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by correctly handling the comparison logic.
