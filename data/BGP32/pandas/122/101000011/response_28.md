## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances by sorting and then checking equality, but it fails in specific cases where two identical blocks have different locations. This bug causes the function `equals` to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

## Identified issue:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function currently uses the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a key for sorting. However, if two identical blocks are located differently, the sorting based on the location would cause incorrect results.

## Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting mechanism that relies on `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. When two identical blocks have different locations, they are falsely identified as distinct due to the sorting based on location, leading to the incorrect equality comparison.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function should not consider the block locations. Instead, it should only consider the essential attributes of the blocks in order to correctly identify identical blocks.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, only based on dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function only uses the block's `dtype.name` for sorting, effectively removing the problematic location-based sorting. This change ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
