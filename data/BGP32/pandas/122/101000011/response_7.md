### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations. This issue stems from the comparison logic inside the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks based on their type name and location can lead to incorrect results if the blocks are identical but located differently.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function where blocks are sorted and compared based on type name and location. If identical blocks have different locations, they may not be correctly identified as equal, leading to a `False` comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than their type name and location. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content rather than location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks is based on their actual content rather than their location or type name. This ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
