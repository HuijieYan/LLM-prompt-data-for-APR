The bug in the provided function `equals()` is that it wrongly returns `True` in cases when the blocks are identical, but have different locations. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when testing the equality of two DataFrames with different data but the same structure, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of this bug can be traced to the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The sorting is done based on a tuple consisting of the block's `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` of the block converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This combination does not effectively distinguish identical blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect equality comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information that can differentiate blocks based on their values, not just their data type and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are now comparing the blocks based on their actual values by comparing the bytes representation of the arrays using `tobytes()`. This modification ensures that blocks with different locations but identical values are correctly identified as unequal.
