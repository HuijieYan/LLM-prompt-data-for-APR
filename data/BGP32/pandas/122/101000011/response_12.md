## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a case where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True` when using the `equals` method.
3. The bug occurs due to the comparison logic not accounting for the potential difference in block locations.
4. The bug arises because the `equals` method currently only compares the blocks based on their order after being sorted, ignoring the original block locations which may vary.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the equality of blocks along with their corresponding original locations.

## Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to compare the blocks using both their sorted order and original locations. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Create dictionaries to store blocks with their locations
    self_block_dict = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_dict = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}

    # Ensure there are equal number of unique blocks with same locations in both BlockManagers
    if len(self_block_dict) != len(other_block_dict):
        return False

    # Compare each unique block with the same location
    for loc, self_block in self_block_dict.items():
        if loc not in other_block_dict:
            return False
        other_block = other_block_dict[loc]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By creating dictionaries to store blocks with their original locations and comparing the blocks based on these locations, we address the issue reported on GitHub.

This modification ensures that the equality comparison considers both the sorted order and the locations of the blocks, producing the expected behavior when checking for equality between different block configurations.
