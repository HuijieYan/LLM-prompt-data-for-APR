### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The `equals` method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking axes, consolidating them in place, comparing the number of blocks, and then comparing each block for equality based on data type and location.
3. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different block locations.
4. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks does not take into account the block locations, resulting in incorrect equality comparisons.
5. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function must include block locations in the sorting key to ensure correct block order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations by combining data type and block locations.
2. Update the sorting key in the `sorted` function to use the modified `canonicalize` function.
3. This modification will ensure that blocks are sorted by both data type and location, fixing the issue of incorrect equality comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations, the corrected version of the `equals` method will now correctly handle comparisons of `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
