## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects within a Pandas DataFrame. The bug stems from the fact that it erroneously considers two blocks with the same contents but differing locations as unequal, leading to incorrect equality evaluations.

## Potential Errors:
1. Comparing block equality based on location rather than content.
2. Sorting blocks based on location.
3. Using `block.equals(oblock)` for comparison.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the sorting of blocks based on their locations (`mgr_locs`) in the `canonicalize` function. This sorting can lead to identical blocks being considered unequal as they may have different locations, even if their contents are the same.

## Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their contents rather than locations. This change will ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal regardless of their locations.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return block.values.tobytes()

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now converts the block values to bytes for comparison, ensuring that blocks with identical contents are sorted as equal. This change ensures that the `equals` function correctly evaluates block equality based on content rather than location.
