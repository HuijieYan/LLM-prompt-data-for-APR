### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas.
2. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The bug was reported on GitHub and described as returning `True` incorrectly for identical blocks with different locations when using the `DataFrame.equals()` method.
4. The issue arises because the `equals` function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly while comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
5. A strategy to fix this bug would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to take block locations into account for sorting and comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the fixed version, a tuple of the block's type name and its location is used for sorting in the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly during comparison. Now, the `equals` function should return the correct result based on the equality of the `BlockManager` objects.
