## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
   
2. The GitHub issue points out a bug where `DataFrame.equals()` function wrongly returns `True` for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
   
3. The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks without taking into account their location. The `canonicalize()` function is used to sort blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it does not consider the actual block content.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by comparing blocks without considering their actual content, leading to false positives in equality checks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should include the actual content of the blocks rather than just their dtype name and locations.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # comparing block values instead of dtype names
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now compares blocks based on their actual values, ensuring that the equality check considers the content of the blocks rather than just their attributes like dtype name and locations. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
