### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects' blocks based on their dtype name and row locations. However, the comparison logic is flawed, resulting in the issue mentioned on GitHub.
2. The bug causes `DataFrame.equals()` to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The issue arises because the `equals` function sorts the blocks within `self` and `other` using their dtype name and row locations, and then compares them. If the blocks are identical but have different locations, the comparison may still return `True`, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to handle cases where the block locations are different but the contents are identical.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Preserve the current logic of sorting the blocks based on dtype name but modify the comparison logic to compare the contents of the blocks irrespective of their locations.
2. One way to achieve this is to compare the blocks' actual data values instead of sorting and comparing based on dtype name and row locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._data)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._data)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- The blocks are sorted based on the actual data content (`_data`) of each block.
- The comparison is then performed on the sorted blocks to ensure that the contents are identical between the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`.

This approach fixes the bug reported on GitHub and ensures that `DataFrame.equals()` correctly handles cases where identical blocks may have different row locations.
