### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises due to the sorting mechanism used for comparing blocks in two different instances (`self` and `other`). The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the two instances have identical blocks but with different locations.

The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this problem where the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for two DataFrames with the same data but different column orders.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared between two instances. Instead of solely relying on the sorting mechanism based on the block properties, we should consider comparing blocks based on their actual content to ensure correct equality checking.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes() + block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a unique identifier for each block based on the actual values in the block concatenated with the block locations. This ensures that blocks are correctly compared for equality based on their content rather than their properties.
