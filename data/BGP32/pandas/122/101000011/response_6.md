### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal.
2. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals()` method mistakenly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Error Location:
The bug arises from the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks in the `equals()` function. The `canonicalize()` function creates a tuple based on block type and location, but it does not consider whether blocks at different locations are actually different.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals()` function does not handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to false positives in the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly handle cases where blocks are the same but have different locations. This can be achieved by comparing blocks based on their contents and the `BlockManager` structure rather than just their types and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a function to compare blocks based on their contents
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.to_native_types() == block2.to_native_types()

    # Compare blocks based on their contents rather than just type and location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not compare_blocks(block1, block2):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their actual content rather than just their types and locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
