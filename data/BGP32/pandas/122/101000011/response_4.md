### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects by first comparing their axes, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares their blocks. The bug described in the GitHub issue suggests that it returns `True` incorrectly in some cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.
   
2. The bug seems to arise from the sorting of blocks based on their type and locations, leading to incorrect comparisons due to the sorting process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not handle cases where blocks have identical content but different locations. The sorting based on dtype name and location can incorrectly group blocks that are actually different due to their different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it considers both the content and location of the blocks for sorting. By incorporating a comparison of content along with dtype name and mgr_locs, we can avoid erroneously grouping blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())  # consider both dtype and content
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the dtype name and content of the blocks by using `block.values.tobytes()` for comparison. This modification ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will be sorted correctly and compared accurately, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
