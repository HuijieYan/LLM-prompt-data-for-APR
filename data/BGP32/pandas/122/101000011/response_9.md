### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by first checking if the axes are of the same length and then comparing each block within the `BlockManager`.

2. The bug seems to be related to the sorting mechanism used on blocks and locations within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on the block's data type and location. This sorting mechanism results in identical blocks with different locations being compared incorrectly, leading to the function erroneously returning True.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be adjusted to effectively differentiate between blocks that might have the same data type but reside in different locations. By modifying the sorting criteria to consider both the data type and the actual content of the block (not just the location), we can prevent identical blocks with different locations from being treated as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._get_values().tolist())  # Modified sorting criteria
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the data type and the actual values of the block. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
