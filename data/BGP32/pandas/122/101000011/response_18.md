### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue:

1. The buggy function in `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function, which is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks, and then performs pair-wise equality checks on the blocks.

2. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where calling the `equals` function on two DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The comparison logic present in the `equals` function is not handling the scenario where two identical blocks have different locations properly.
2. The sorting of the blocks before comparison might lead to incorrect results if blocks have been reordered.
3. The `canonicalize` function is used for sorting the blocks but may not be sufficient to distinguish blocks with similar characteristics but different locations.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:

The bug arises from the comparison logic not accounting for blocks with identical content but different locations. The sorting mechanism used in the buggy function does not consider block locations, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Update the comparison logic to include checks for identical blocks with different locations.
2. Modify the sorting mechanism to consider block locations as part of the comparison key.
3. Ensure that the equality comparison is robust against blocks being in different orders but with the same content.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Skip sorting blocks and directly compare based on location and content
    self_block_locs = [(block, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_locs = [(block, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in other.blocks]

    if len(self_block_locs) != len(other_block_locs):
        return False

    for self_block, self_loc in self_block_locs:
        found = False
        for other_block, other_loc in other_block_locs:
            if self_block.equals(other_block) and self_loc == other_loc:
                found = True
                other_block_locs.remove((other_block, other_loc))
                break
        if not found:
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the blocks based on both content and location, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are not falsely identified as equal. By bypassing the sorting step and comparing each block individually with its correct location, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved.
