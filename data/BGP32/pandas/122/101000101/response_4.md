### Analysis
1. The function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function checks if the lengths of the axes are equal and if all axes are equal for both objects.
3. It then consolidates both objects in place using `_consolidate_inplace`.
4. Next, it compares the number of blocks in both objects.
5. The function then sorts the blocks of each object based on the dtype name and manager locations.
6. Finally, it iterates through the sorted blocks and checks if each pair is equal.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `canonicalize` function attempts to access `block.dtype.name` without considering that `block.dtype` might be `None` for certain block types. This causes an AttributeError when accessing `name` on a `None` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle cases where `block.dtype` is `None`. We can modify the function to return a tuple with a default value for `dtype.name` if `block.dtype` is `None`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = block.dtype.name if block.dtype is not None else "NoneType"
        return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, we handle the case where `block.dtype` is `None` by using a default value "NoneType" for the dtype name in the `canonicalize` function. This should prevent the AttributeError and correctly compare the blocks for equality.
