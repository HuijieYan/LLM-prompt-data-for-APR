### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function where it tries to access the `mgr_locs` attribute directly on the `Block` object. However, the correct attribute is `mgr_locs`, and it should be accessed as a property of the block object. This error causes an AttributeError which leads to the buggy behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute as a property of the `block` object within the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function correctly accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute as a property of the `block` object within the `canonicalize` function, resolving the AttributeError issue. It should now work as expected with the provided test cases.
