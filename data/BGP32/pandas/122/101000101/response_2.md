The bug in the provided function is related to the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is called. This part is causing the bug because `block.mgr_locs` is not an attribute that exists in the `Block` class. Instead, it seems like `mgr_locs` should be accessed from the `block`'s parent `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to access `mgr_locs` from the correct object. We can modify `canonicalize` to take a `BlockManager` object as a parameter and then retrieve `mgr_locs` from there.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(manager, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, manager.blocks[block].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should produce the expected output without any bugs. The `canonicalize` function now receives the `manager` parameter, which represents the `BlockManager` object holding the `blocks`, and it can access the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly.
