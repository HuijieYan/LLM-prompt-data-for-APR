### Explanation:
The buggy function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, number of blocks, and the content of each block. The bug in the function arises when trying to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`, but there are two issues:
1. `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is incorrect. It should be `list(block.mgr_locs.as_array)`.
2. The type of `block.dtype` is `numpy.dtype` which doesn't have the attribute `name`. It should be accessed using `block.dtype.name`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the access to `mgr_locs` using `list(block.mgr_locs.as_array)`.
2. Access the data type name using `block.dtype.name`.

### Corrected Version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these corrections, the function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` objects based on the axes, number of blocks, and the content of each block.
