### Analysis and Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the axes, consolidates them, compares the number of blocks, and then proceeds to compare the blocks themselves. The bug in the function arises from the `canonicalize` function, which is used to create a tuple for sorting the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.

The bug occurs because the `as_array` function is not being called correctly on `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function. This results in calling `as_array` on the `BlockPlacement` object directly without any parentheses, leading to a AttributeError as the `BlockPlacement` object doesn't have an `as_array` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `as_array` method should be called correctly on `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to call `as_array` as `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`, we can fix the bug and ensure the function operates correctly as expected.
