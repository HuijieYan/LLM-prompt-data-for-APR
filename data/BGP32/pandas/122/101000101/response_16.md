### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs because the `canonicalize` function is trying to access the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes of a block without checking if they exist. This leads to an AttributeError when the function is called with a different block type that does not have these attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to check if the block has the necessary attributes before accessing them. This will prevent the AttributeError and ensure that the function works correctly with different block types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = getattr(block, 'dtype', None)
        mgr_locs_list = getattr(block, 'mgr_locs', None)
        return (dtype_name, mgr_locs_list)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

This corrected version of the function modifies the `canonicalize` function to use the `getattr` function to safely access the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes of the blocks. This ensures that the function will not raise an AttributeError when called with different block types.
