### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their axes and blocks. It sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparing them. The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function where it should access `mgr_locs` from the blocks correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function attempts to access `mgr_locs` directly from the `block` instance in the `canonicalize` function. However, `mgr_locs` is an attribute of the `Block` class, not directly accessible from the `block` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to access `mgr_locs` attribute correctly by calling it on the `block` instance within the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function correctly calls `mgr_locs.as_slice()` on the `block` instance to access the locations of the block. This ensures that the comparison and sorting of blocks is done accurately.
