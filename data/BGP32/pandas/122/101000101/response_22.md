## Analysis
The buggy function is a method within the `BlockManager` class. It is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal between the two `BlockManager` objects. Then, it compares each axis pair using the `equals` method of the axes. After that, it consolidates the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks for equality.

The bug in the function arises from the incorrect usage of the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is intended to generate a canonical representation of a block based on its dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be replaced with `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` to correctly access the list representation of the `mgr_locs` attribute.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the access to the `mgr_locs` attribute within the `canonicalize` function. By modifying this part, the function should work as intended and provide the expected output values based on the input parameters provided in the test cases.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making the above correction to the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function will correctly access and create a canonical representation for the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects. This should align with the expected behavior and output values specified in the test cases.
