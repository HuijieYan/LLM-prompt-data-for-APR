### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidates the blocks inplace, sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, and then compares each block pair. 

The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly causing a `TypeError` since `.as_array` is a method and not an attribute of `block.mgr_locs`. This error leads to failure in the comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `.as_array()` method correctly on `block.mgr_locs`. By adjusting this part of the function, we can ensure that the comparison between blocks proceeds without any errors.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this adjustment, we can ensure the `canonicalize` function now correctly accesses the `.as_array()` method of `block.mgr_locs`, resolving the `TypeError` and fixing the bug within the function.
