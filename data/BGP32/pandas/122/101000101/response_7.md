### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the ordering of the blocks. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function, but the comparison is flawed due to a potential error in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent and unique key for each block. In this case, using the `mgr_locs` attribute directly as part of the key can lead to incorrect results due to the mutable nature of this attribute. Instead, we can use the combination of the `dtype.name` and block values to create a reliable key for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a consistent and unique key for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values.tobytes())  # Using dtype name and block values for comparison
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use the block's `dtype.name` and `values` for comparison, we ensure that each block has a unique and consistent key for sorting and comparison. This correction should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
