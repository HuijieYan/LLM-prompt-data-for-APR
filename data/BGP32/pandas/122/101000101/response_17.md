The bug in the function stems from the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function should return a tuple with the type name and a representation of the block's location. However, in the buggy version of the function, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is used to represent block location, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple with the type name and a correct representation of block location. We can achieve this by using `block.mgr_locs` directly in the tuple.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain the same
  
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and block location
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple with the type name and block location, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly, fixing the bug in the function.
