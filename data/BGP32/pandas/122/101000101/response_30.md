The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function where the attribute `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly. The correct way to access this attribute is by using `block.mgr_locs`, not `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
```

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrections applied to the `canonicalize` function, the buggy function should now work correctly based on the expected input/output values provided.
