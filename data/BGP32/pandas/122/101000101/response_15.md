### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way block comparison is done using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is attempting to sort the blocks based on their data type name and the locations of the blocks in memory. However, the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call in the `canonicalize` function is incorrect. It should be `block.mgr_locs`, accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute directly rather than trying to convert it to a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function by using `block.mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to properly represent the block's locations for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying the corrected version of the code, the bug related to incorrect comparison of block locations should be resolved, and the function should now return the correct Boolean result for the equality comparison.
