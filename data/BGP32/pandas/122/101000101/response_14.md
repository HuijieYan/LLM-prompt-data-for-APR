### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The incorrect part is `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue is that `block.mgr_locs.as_array` is attempting to call a method on `block.mgr_locs` that does not exist, leading to an AttributeError. This causes the function to crash before returning the correct result. The expected behavior was to access the `BlockPlacement` attribute `locs` instead of `as_array`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to correctly access the 'locs' attribute of `block.mgr_locs` instead of trying to call `as_array` directly on `block.mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the bug is resolved and the function can return the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Corrected version of the canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.locs.tolist())  # Accessing 'locs' attribute instead of 'as_array'

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

By correcting the `canonicalize` function as described above, the bug in the function will be fixed, and the corrected function should now return the expected output for the provided test cases.
