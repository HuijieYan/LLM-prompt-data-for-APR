The bug in the given function lies in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The attribute `mgr_locs` does not have a method `as_array`, which causes the code to throw an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the relevant information from the block for comparison. We can use the properties of the block directly instead of trying to access non-existing methods.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain the same

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.values)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, we are now properly extracting the necessary information from the block for a comparison, which resolves the AttributeError issue. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
