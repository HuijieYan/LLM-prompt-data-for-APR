### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block within them.
2. The bug could be due to an incorrect comparison of block elements within the `BlockManager`.
3. The bug likely occurs when comparing the blocks. The function `canonicalize` is used to create a key for sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations, but there might be issues with how the blocks are compared inside the loop.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate and reflects the expected behavior.
5. We can correct the comparison logic between blocks inside the loop to address the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a key for blocks based on the block's type name and locations and properly sorts the blocks before comparing them. The comparison inside the loop now compares the sorted blocks accurately to address the bug.
