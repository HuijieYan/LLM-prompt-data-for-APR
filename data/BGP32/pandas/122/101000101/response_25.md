The bug in the provided function occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. When comparing the blocks, the function is sorting them based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, and then checking for equality. 

However, a block's dtype name alone might not be sufficient to determine if two blocks are equal. The sorting based on dtype name may not ensure the correct order when comparing blocks, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can consider sorting the blocks based on multiple criteria such as dtype name and mgr_locs contents to ensure a consistent and accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on multiple criteria
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version now considers sorting the blocks based on both dtype name and mgr_locs contents to ensure a more robust comparison between blocks and prevent the bug from occurring.
