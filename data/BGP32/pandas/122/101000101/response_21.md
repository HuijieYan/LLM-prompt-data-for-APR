### Bugs and Explanation
In the provided buggy function, there is a significant issue with the canonicalize function. The issue stems from the incorrect usage of `as_array` method. The buggy function calls `as_array` directly on `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object, assuming it is a method, which results in an AttributeError. However, `mgr_locs` is not a method but an attribute. This leads to a failure in the buggy function. There are also inconsistencies in the comment documentation and the actual method/attribute calls within the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to access the `values` attribute of the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object instead of calling it as a method. This corrects the erroneous implementation and ensures that the function works as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By accessing the `values` attribute correctly, we ensure that the canonicalize function works as expected and the buggy function returns the correct result.
