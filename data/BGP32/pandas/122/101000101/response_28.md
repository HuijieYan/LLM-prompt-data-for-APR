### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the given function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is done using the `equals` method which in turn should compare the block's data and locations. However, the comparison is based on the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block which is then compared as a list. This comparison does not accurately represent the equality of blocks and can lead to incorrect results when determining if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considers both the data and locations of the blocks. This can be achieved by using the `equals` method of the blocks directly rather than comparing their `mgr_locs` attribute as a list.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the equality comparison is done based on the block data and locations. This should provide a more accurate determination of whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
