The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is incorrectly used. The issue here is that `mgr_locs` is accessed as if it's an attribute directly on `block`, which leads to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to access `mgr_locs` from `block` correctly by using `block.mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version correctly addresses the issue with accessing `mgr_locs` from `block` and should now work as expected based on the provided test cases.
