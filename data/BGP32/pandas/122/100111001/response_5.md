The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts these blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, which might not be the correct approach for determining equality. This sorting might lead to incorrect comparisons, resulting in the function returning `False` even when the DataFrames are equal.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to directly compare the blocks without sorting them based on type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks in the DataFrames without unnecessary sorting. It should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` as provided.
