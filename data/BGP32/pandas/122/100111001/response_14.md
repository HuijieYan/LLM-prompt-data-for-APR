### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks based on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting operation might not be sufficient to correctly compare the blocks.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test aims to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have different values and data types in their columns. The `equals` method is expected to return `False` in this case. However, due to the bug in the sorting mechanism of blocks inside the function, the comparison based on the block content is not accurate. This results in the function returning `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly. Instead of using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting, we can consider sorting based on block values to enable accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their values, enabling an accurate comparison between DataFrames in the `equals` method.
