### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two BlockManagers by checking their axes, followed by sorting and comparing their blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` having different values in different orders.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison logic within the function that is not handling the case of different values correctly.
5. The fix should involve modifying the comparison logic to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of the order or type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the equals function currently compares the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which might not be sufficient to determine if two DataFrames are equal, especially when their values are different.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values within the blocks for comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to compare the values within the blocks instead of the dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we compare the values within the blocks using `np.array_equal` to determine if the DataFrames are equal. This modification ensures that the function compares the actual values rather than just the dtype and manager locations.
