### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` in pandas. The function first checks if the axes of both `self` and `other` are the same. Next, it compares each block within the `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the comparison logic for the blocks seems to be incorrect, resulting in failing test cases.

Based on the failing test, it seems that the function is not correctly comparing the values of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the method call `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug lies in the sorting of blocks before comparing them. The function uses a sorting key `canonicalize` to sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting key does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks in different order since the actual content comparison is needed rather than the block characteristics.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic should focus on comparing the content of blocks rather than their characteristics such as data type and memory location. The function should iterate through each block and compare the values within them to determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values within the blocks instead of their characteristics, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
