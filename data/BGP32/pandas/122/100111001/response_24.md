### Bug analysis
The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The function first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal in length. Then, it checks if each axis is equal using the `equals` method. Next, it consolidates the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects in place. Finally, it compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects after sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with different column values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method. The error message states that the assertion fails with `assert True is False`.

Looking at the runtime input values and variables at the function's return, it seems that the function does not handle the comparison of the block values correctly, leading to the failing test.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the block values in both `BlockManager` objects is done correctly. We should compare the values within the blocks rather than comparing the blocks directly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_values[idx], other_values[idx]) for idx in range(len(self_values))
    )
```

By comparing the values within the blocks using `np.array_equal`, the corrected function ensures that the comparison is done correctly, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
