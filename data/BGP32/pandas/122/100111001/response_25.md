### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `equals` is failing to compare two DataFrame objects correctly. The main issue arises from the comparison of the blocks in the DataFrames, which results in the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failing with the error `assert True is False`.

The comparison logic in the function sorts the blocks based on their dtype names and manager locations but fails to consider the comparison of block values, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to compare not only the block metadata (dtype and manager locations) but also the actual values stored in the blocks. This will ensure that the equality check considers both block properties and content.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `values` attribute of the blocks into the `canonicalize` function and comparing it within the `equals` loop, we ensure a more robust equality check that considers both block properties and values. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
