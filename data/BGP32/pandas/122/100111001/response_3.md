### Identified Bug:
The bug is within the `canonicalize` function used for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug arises due to comparing incompatible types (`int64` vs `object`) in the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when comparing `block.dtype.name` in the `canonicalize` function, it results in comparing different types (`int64` vs `object`). This issue leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks, causing the `equals` function to return incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing compatible types in the `canonicalize` function. One way to achieve this is by explicitly converting the `dtype.name` to a string before comparison, avoiding the issue of incompatible types.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the modification in the `canonicalize` function to ensure compatible types for comparison, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test and provide accurate comparisons for DataFrame blocks.
