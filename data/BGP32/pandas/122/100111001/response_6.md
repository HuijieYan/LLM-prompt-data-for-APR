### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is sorting the blocks based on their data type and memory manager locations for comparison, which is incorrect. The bug causes the function to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have different values but can be consolidated due to a common data type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the content of each block directly, rather than sorting them based on data type and memory manager locations before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By making this change, the function should now compare the blocks directly, allowing for correct DataFrame equality checks.
