### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager instances `self` and `other` for equality. The bug lies in the comparison logic implemented in the function. The function compares the axes of both BlockManagers, ensures they have the same number of blocks, and then proceeds to compare individual blocks. However, the comparison of blocks is flawed due to the method used to sort and compare them.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same column names. The test asserts that `df1` is not equal to `df2`. The error message indicates that the equality check returns `True` incorrectly, causing the test to fail.

### Bug:
The bug in the code is within the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The current sorting mechanism based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` is not suitable for identifying the difference between blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify a better way to distinguish and sort the blocks for comparison.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to ensure blocks are correctly sorted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks based on labels and values for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the fix, the corrected `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on the labels, allowing for effective comparison of the blocks in the BlockManagers. This change addresses the bug identified and should resolve the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
