The bug in the `equals` function lies in how the blocks are being compared. The function is sorting the blocks based on their data type name and memory locations, but the comparison is not accurate. This results in the function incorrectly determining that the two DataFrames are equal when they are not.

To fix this bug, we need to update the way the blocks are compared. Instead of using data type names and memory locations for comparison, we should compare the actual block data.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on data type names and memory locations.

With this correction, the function should now correctly determine that the two DataFrames are not equal in the failing test case and pass the test.
