### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. However, when comparing the blocks for equality, it incorrectly uses the `equals` method of the blocks themselves instead of considering the block data. This results in incorrect comparison logic and leads to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be corrected. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, we should compare the data within the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the block values and block types rather than relying on the `equals` method of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values) and block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version compares the block values and locations directly, ensuring that the blocks are compared based on their data rather than their instances.
