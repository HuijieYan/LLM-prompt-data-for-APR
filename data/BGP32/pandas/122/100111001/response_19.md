### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self` and `other`. The comparison is based on the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks, but it fails to account for cases where the blocks are not in the same order within the DataFrames. This leads to incorrect comparisons between the blocks and the function returning incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `a` and `b` having values of different types in reversed order. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, the buggy `equals` function wrongly concludes that the DataFrames are equal due to the block comparison logic, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly without relying on their order. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on the column names before comparison. 

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by column names
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.items[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.items[0])

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on column names before comparison, the corrected `equals` function will now handle cases where the blocks are not in the same order correctly and pass the failing test.
