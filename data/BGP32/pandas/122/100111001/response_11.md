### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is done using the `block.equals(oblock)` expression. 

However, the `equals` method used for comparison is comparing blocks based on their memory locations rather than content. This causes the comparison to fail even if the blocks have the same content but are stored in different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison step to verify the equality of blocks based on their content rather than their memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the bug fix applied:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Ensure consolidation before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not memory location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the blocks are now compared based on their values rather than their memory locations, ensuring accurate comparison for equality.
