### Error in the buggy function:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. It starts by checking if the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal, then it consolidates the BlockManager objects, sorts the blocks within each BlockManager based on their dtype and mgr_locs, and finally checks if all corresponding blocks are equal. However, there is an issue in the sorting part of the function where the `canonicalize` function incorrectly accesses the `dtype.name` rather than directly comparing the dtype objects. This causes a mismatch in the sorting order and leads to incorrect equality comparisons between the two BlockManager objects.

### Proposed fix:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the dtype objects directly. This will ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparing them for equality.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare the dtype objects directly, we ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before performing equality comparisons. This corrected version should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
