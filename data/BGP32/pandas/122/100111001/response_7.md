### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is checking if two block managers (self and other) are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames that have different values in columns 'a' and 'b'.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it expects True to be False, showing the difference between the two DataFrames.
4. The bug is likely in how the function compares the blocks of the two managers, leading to a false positive result of equality due to the sorting approach used.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to the sorting mechanism applied to the blocks for comparison. The function sorts the blocks based on the data type name and `mgr_locs` values. If the values in the DataFrames are different but have the same data type name and `mgr_locs`, the function incorrectly considers them as equal, causing the bug.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using `canonicalize` to sort the blocks, compare the blocks directly to ensure consistency.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the actual values in the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the updated comparison logic to directly compare the blocks in the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
