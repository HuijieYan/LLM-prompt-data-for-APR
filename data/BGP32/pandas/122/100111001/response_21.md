The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The issue lies in how the function `canonicalize` constructs the key to sort blocks.

The error message and failing test case indicate that the function is incorrectly comparing data types while sorting the blocks. This is evident from comparing the expected and actual data in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the sorting key (`canonicalize`) is properly constructed to reflect the structure of the blocks in a way that correctly identifies them for comparison.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more robust approach for identifying blocks. In this case, we can concatenate the block data type with the block's values to create a unique identifier.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by concatenating data type and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype) + str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
