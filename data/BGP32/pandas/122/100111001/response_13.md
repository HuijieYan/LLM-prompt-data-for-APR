### Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be related to the comparison of the two DataFrames' column values. The `equals` function is comparing the DataFrames element-wise which leads to the assertion error in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the buggy code compares the values in a different order than expected by the test. The sorted order of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` can differ from the original DataFrame order, causing the comparison to fail.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare DataFrames based on their column values regardless of their order. We should compare the column labels first and then iterate over each column to compare their values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_cols, other_cols = self.columns.tolist(), other.columns.tolist()
    if set(self_cols) != set(other_cols):
        return False

    for col in self_cols:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares DataFrames based on their column values rather than their internal block structure. It ensures the equality of individual columns regardless of their order, fixing the issue observed in the failing test.
