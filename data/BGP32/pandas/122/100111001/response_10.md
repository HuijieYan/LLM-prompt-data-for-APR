### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects based on their blocks. The function attempts to sort the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects by converting them into lists and then comparing them using the `equals` method. This approach is flawed because converting blocks into lists loses important information and may lead to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should directly compare the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects without converting them into lists. We can achieve this by comparing each pair of blocks in the respective `BlockManager` objects using the `equals` method and then returning the overall equality result.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, we ensure a correct equality check and address the bug that caused the failing test.
