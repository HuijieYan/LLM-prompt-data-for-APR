### Cause of the Bug
The bug is in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing `self` and `other` BlockManagers, the function fails to correctly compare the blocks within them. This leads to a false positive result in the equality check, causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` to return `assert True is False` error message.

### Bug Location
The bug likely originates from the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize()` function. This sorting might not consider all aspects of the blocks, leading to incorrect ordering and comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization function accurately represents the blocks and how they should be sorted. This ensures that the comparison done later is valid and reflects the true equality of the `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.items.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The correction involves sorting the blocks based on the type's name and the block's items rather than dtype and mgr_locs. This should provide a more accurate comparison between the blocks and correctly determine the equality of the BlockManagers.
