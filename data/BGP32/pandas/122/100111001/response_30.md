### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to check equality between two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared for equality. In the failing test, the function is being called with two `DataFrame` instances that have different values in their columns. The function should return `False` in this case, but it is failing to do so.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it evaluates to `True is False`, causing the test to fail.

In the provided runtime values, we can see that the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are correctly populated. The issue most likely lies in how the blocks are being compared for equality using the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality comparison between the blocks considers the actual data values within the blocks, rather than just their dtype and locations. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the data values as well.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the actual block values, we ensure that the equality comparison considers the entire content of the blocks. This change should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
