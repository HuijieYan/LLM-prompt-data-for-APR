The issue in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self` and `other` DataFrames without considering the actual data within the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is intended to group blocks by their dtype and mgr_locs to facilitate comparison. However, in the provided implementation, the `canonicalize` function is not extracting the actual data for comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual block data when generating the key for sorting the blocks. This way, the comparison is based on both the dtype, mgr_locs, and the data within the blocks. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values.tolist()  # Adding block values for comparison
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `values` of the block, ensuring that the comparison between blocks considers the actual data values.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
