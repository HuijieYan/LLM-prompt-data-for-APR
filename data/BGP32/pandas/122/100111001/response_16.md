### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. However, the function does not correctly handle the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug seems to be caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which may not be able to differentiate between blocks accurately.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block type and location. This sorting method may not be suitable for comparing blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. The implementation of the `canonicalize` function may not be accurately representing the differences between blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks within the `BlockManager` is done correctly. We should focus on comparing the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on an arbitrary combination of the block type and location. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`, rather than sorting based on an unreliable method, the corrected function should properly determine equality between the two `BlockManager` objects.
