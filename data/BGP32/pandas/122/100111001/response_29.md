### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of blocks in the `equals` function might not be correct due to the sorting and extracting logic.
2. There could be an issue with the implementation of the `canonicalize` function for generating a unique key for sorting blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but same structure. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, however, the current implementation of `equals` function fails to identify the difference correctly, leading to an AssertionError.

The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on type and locations, aiming to identify any differences between the DataFrames. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in how this function operates or generates unique keys, causing the wrong blocks to be compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure it generates unique identifiers for blocks.
2. Verify that the sorting based on this unique identifier works correctly to match similar blocks.
3. Update the comparison logic to correctly identify differences between the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to generate a unique key for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.apply(tuple))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to better differentiate between blocks and ensuring the correct sorting logic, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames, thus passing the failing test case.
