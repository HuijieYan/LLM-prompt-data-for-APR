### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality based on axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values for columns `'a'` and `'b`' to illustrate the inequality check.
3. The error message indicates that the equality assertion fails (`assert True is False`) while comparing two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function.
4. The failing assertion suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two dataframes.
5. The provided runtime values indicate the input parameters, variable values, and types during execution of the failing test.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic when checking the equality of blocks in the `equals` function. The function compares blocks based on their types and `mgr_locs`, but this approach might not accurately capture the inequality among blocks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to ensure that it correctly identifies the inequality between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the comparison step to directly compare the blocks without sorting based on type and locs, the corrected version should accurately identify the inequality between the two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
