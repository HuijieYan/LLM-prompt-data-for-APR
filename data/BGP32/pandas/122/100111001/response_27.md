The bug in the `equals` function is related to comparing DataFrame objects that have columns with different types and values. The function currently sorts the blocks based on their data type and memory location, which may not be the appropriate approach for comparing DataFrames.

### Issue:
- The `equals` function inappropriately sorts the DataFrame blocks based on data type and memory location, leading to incorrect comparison results when DataFrames have columns with different types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the DataFrame blocks are compared within the `equals` function. Instead of sorting blocks based on data type and memory location, we can directly compare the blocks to check equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting them based on data type and memory location, the corrected function should now pass the failing test scenario and accurately compare DataFrames for equality.
