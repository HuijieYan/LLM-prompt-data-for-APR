### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not be correct due to how the `canonicalize` function is implemented.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not handling the sorting of blocks correctly based on dtype name and manager locations. This causes the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to fail, leading to the `equals` function returning `False` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly converts the block information to a comparable and sortable format. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on dtype name and manager locations consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the dtype and manager locations to a sortable format, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
