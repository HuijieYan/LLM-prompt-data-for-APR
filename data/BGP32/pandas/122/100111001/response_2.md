### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
- In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames with different column orders, leading to the assertion failure.
- The error message shows that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`, indicating a comparison issue in the blocking logic.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the values within the blocks themselves.
- Since sorting based only on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` is insufficient when comparing actual data values, the function fails to detect the equivalence of DataFrames when the order of columns differs.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the values within the blocks for proper comparison.
2. Instead of just sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, include the block's actual data values in the key for sorting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the DataFrames based on both the block metadata and the actual data values inside the blocks, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
