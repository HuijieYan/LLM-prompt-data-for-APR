The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `as_array` attribute appears to be missing in the call to `as_array.tolist()` within the `canonicalize` function, leading to a `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `as_array` attribute before calling `tolist()`. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the correct access to the `as_array` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, the bug causing the `AttributeError` should be resolved, and the `equals` function should now work as expected.
