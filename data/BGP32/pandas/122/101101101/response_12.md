The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares the blocks without considering their order, leading to incorrect results. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on a canonicalized representation before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by sorting based on a tuple representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a canonicalized representation before comparing them, thus resolving the buggy behavior.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
