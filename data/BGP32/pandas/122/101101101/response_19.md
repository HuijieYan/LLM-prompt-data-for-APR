The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which is using `dtype.name` as a key for sorting. In Case 1, `block.dtype` is of type `dtype('int64')`, which may not have a meaningful name or ordering for comparison. This can lead to incorrect sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can update the `canonicalize` function to consider a more suitable key for sorting the blocks. For example, we can use the block's data type directly (`block.dtype`) to compare blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction should address the issue by sorting blocks based on their data types directly, ensuring a meaningful comparison for equality.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` by comparing the blocks appropriately.
