### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting logic applied to the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting key defined in the `canonicalize` function is incorrect, leading to the inconsistency in block comparison which causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function such that it properly captures the necessary information for sorting the blocks. Specifically, we need to consider the block data types and refer to the actual data locations within the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order using block data type and actual data positions
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block values and the data locations within the blocks for sorting, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is consistent and accurate. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
