### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. When comparing the blocks for equality, the `canonicalize` function doesn't account for the block's data, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data in the comparison to ensure correct sorting and comparison of blocks between `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, by including actual block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now includes the block's actual data when sorting the blocks, ensuring that the comparison between `BlockManager` instances is done correctly.
