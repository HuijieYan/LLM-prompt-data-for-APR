### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The bug occurs when sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function attempts to create a tuple consisting of the block's type name and its location, but the bug arises from improper access of the `mgr_locs` attribute inside the `Block` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed correctly inside the `Block` object. We should update the `canonicalize` function to directly access the `mgr_locs` attribute while creating the tuple for comparison. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to directly access mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function should now properly compare the blocks based on their type name and location for each `BlockManager`, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case.
