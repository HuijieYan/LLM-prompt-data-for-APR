### Analysis
The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects based on their axes, blocks, and dtype. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal between the two BlockManagers. If not, it returns False. Then, it iterates over the blocks in each BlockManager, sorts them based on dtype and mgr_locs, and checks if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other BlockManager.

The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared. The sorting is done based on dtype and mgr_locs, but the comparison is done using the `equals()` method directly, which might not handle the comparison correctly.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize()` function is applied to each block to create a tuple for sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs. However, the `equals()` method is called directly on the blocks without considering the tuple comparison for dtype and mgr_locs.

### Fix
To fix the bug, I will modify the comparison part to compare the canonicalized blocks using the `canonicalize()` function. This way, the comparison will consider both dtype and mgr_locs values for equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected version now sorts the blocks based on the combined tuple of dtype and mgr_locs in the `canonicalize()` function and compares the sorted blocks using the `equals()` method. This ensures that the comparison considers both dtype and mgr_locs values for equality.
