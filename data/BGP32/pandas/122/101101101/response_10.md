### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting logic applied to `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes of each block to determine their order. However, the `dtype.name` attribute is not sufficient to determine the equality of blocks in this context. As a result, the sorting performed based on this attribute can lead to incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function to consider a more precise attribute or combination of attributes that would accurately distinguish between blocks for equality comparison. We should use attributes that provide consistent and meaningful information about the blocks.

### Corrected Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Expected Outcome

The corrected `equals` function should now appropriately compare the blocks based on their values, rather than just the `dtype.name`. This change ensures a more accurate ordering and comparison of blocks, addressing the bug identified in the original implementation.
