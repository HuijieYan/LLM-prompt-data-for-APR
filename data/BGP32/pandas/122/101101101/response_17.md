## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The issue comes from the comparison of `mgr_locs` as a list in the `canonicalize` function. Inside the `canonicalize` function, `mgr_locs` is accessed as an array and then converted to a list, which leads to incorrect comparison during sorting.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the access of `mgr_locs` inside the `canonicalize` function. Instead of converting it to a list, we should directly access it as an array. This will ensure that blocks are sorted based on their `dtype.name` and correct locations without data alteration.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the bug fix implemented:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly accessing `mgr_locs.as_array` without converting it to a list, we ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on their dtype and locations. This correction should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
