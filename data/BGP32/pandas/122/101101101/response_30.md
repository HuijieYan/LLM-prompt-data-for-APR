### Bug description
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing two BlockManager objects. The bug arises from the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager instances. The issue lies in the way the blocks are sorted and compared. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and location, but the comparison logic does not consider all scenarios where the blocks might be different.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers all relevant attributes that could differentiate blocks. We should compare the blocks based on their data, not just their type name and location as in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]
        
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the blocks one by one, ensuring that the comparison includes all relevant attributes of the blocks. This approach should address the issue with the buggy function.
