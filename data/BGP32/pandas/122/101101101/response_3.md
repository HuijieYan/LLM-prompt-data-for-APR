The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is not correctly comparing the blocks in the expected order.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than just their type and location. We can achieve this by comparing the actual values within the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their actual content by converting the block values to bytes within the `canonicalize` function. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly, fixing the bug.
