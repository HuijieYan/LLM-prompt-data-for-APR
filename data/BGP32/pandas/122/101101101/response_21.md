### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function within the buggy `equals` function. The issue lies in the comparison and sorting of blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, but when comparing the blocks, the code is iterating over `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` as `(block, oblock)` which are not unpacked tuples, causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare and sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to directly return a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, and then compare and sort the blocks based on this tuple. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly compare and sort the blocks before checking their equality, which will resolve the failing test case.
