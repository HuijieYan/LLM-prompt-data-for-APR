### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the use of `canonicalize` function incorrectly. The sorting key in `canonicalize` should combine the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object. However, in the buggy code, `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly using `as_array.tolist()`, which doesn't provide a suitable representation for sorting. This results in incorrect comparison and leads to a false negative return value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correct the `canonicalize` function to properly combine the type name and `mgr_locs` attribute for sorting. We need to ensure that the sorting key uniquely identifies each block for comparison.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Applying this fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
