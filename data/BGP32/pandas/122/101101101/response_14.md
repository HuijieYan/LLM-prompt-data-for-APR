### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on their `mgr_locs` attribute after converting it to a list with `.as_array.tolist()`. However, `mgr_locs` is not a list but a `BlockPlacement` object, which does not have a `.tolist()` method, leading to an AttributeError in the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `BlockPlacement` object without trying to call a non-existent `.tolist()` method on it.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected version of the canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making the above correction to the `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test provided.
