### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks present in the `BlockManager`. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on their type and locations (`mgr_locs`), but due to incorrect handling of the block sorting, it fails to compare the blocks correctly leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test scenario, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function which combines the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. Since `mgr_locs` are not correctly represented as a list, the sorting logic fails to order the blocks accurately. As a result, the `equals` comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is invalid, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is correctly converted to a list before applying the sorting logic. By updating the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple with the block's type name and a list representation of `mgr_locs`, we can sort the blocks accurately and perform the comparison correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to convert `mgr_locs` to a list within the tuple generation, the `equals` function will now correctly sort and compare the blocks in the `BlockManager`, thus passing the failing test and providing accurate equality checks.
