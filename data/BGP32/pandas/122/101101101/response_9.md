### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality due to a mishandling of sorting the blocks before comparison. The bug arises from the incorrect logic in sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This does not guarantee the correct order for comparison, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent order before comparing them for equality. One approach could be to sort the blocks based on a unique identifier that remains consistent for each block. In this case, we can use the block's `index` or `block._loc` attribute as a key for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort blocks based on a unique identifier for consistent comparison
        def get_block_key(block):
            return block.index
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a unique key like `block.index`, we ensure a consistent order for comparison, fixing the bug and allowing the `equals` function to correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
