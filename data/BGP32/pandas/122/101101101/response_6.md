### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises due to the incorrect comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The function attempts to sort these blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes of each block. However, the comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function is flawed, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function's logic to properly compare the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes. By ensuring a correct comparison mechanism, we can accurately sort and compare the blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to cast the `dtype` as a string and correctly compare the `mgr_locs`, the corrected function should now correctly sort and compare the blocks in the BlockManagers. This correction addresses the bug and should pass the failing test provided.
