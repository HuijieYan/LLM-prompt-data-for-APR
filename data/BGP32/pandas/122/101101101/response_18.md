The bug in the `equals` function arises from an incorrect comparison between the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function where the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list is incorrect. 

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function converts `mgr_locs` to a list improperly, causing incorrect comparison of blocks. Since the `mgr_locs` attribute is essential for distinguishing blocks, the flawed conversion leads to incorrect order determination, resulting in a failed test.

### Fix Strategy:
Correct the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list in the `canonicalize` function to accurately differentiate and compare blocks based on their location.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects, passing the failing test provided.
