### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals()` function lies in the `canonicalize()` function that sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` key, which combines the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for each block. 

However, the issue arises from comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks as a list. The `mgr_locs` attribute is not a list but an instance of `BlockPlacement`, which is why converting it directly to a list using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block appropriately, ensuring that the comparison between blocks is correct. We should compare the `BlockPlacement` objects directly rather than converting them to lists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version compares the `BlockPlacement` objects directly, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly and the test case will pass successfully.
