The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects, checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The issue lies in the comparison of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparing them, but the sorting is done based on the dtype name and mgr_locs, which might not be a reliable way to distinguish between blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their actual data values rather than their internal attributes. One way to achieve this is to convert the blocks into numpy arrays and compare the arrays element-wise.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `get_blocks()` method is used to get the blocks from `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, and then the `array_equal` function from numpy is used to compare the actual data values of the blocks.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the `BlockManager` objects based on their actual data values, making the comparison more reliable and passing the failing test.
