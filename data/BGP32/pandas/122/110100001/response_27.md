## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals()` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing individual blocks within the `BlockManager`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames with different column data types, which should return False but the buggy function does not handle this case correctly.
4. The bug occurs because the `equals()` method does not account for the scenario where blocks have different data types, leading to incorrect equality checks for DataFrames with different data types.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` method to compare blocks with different data types correctly.

## Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.shape, block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        pd.DataFrame(block.values).equals(pd.DataFrame(oblock.values)) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

Now, the `equals()` method has been modified to compare blocks based on their data types and values, ensuring correct comparison for DataFrames with different data types. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
