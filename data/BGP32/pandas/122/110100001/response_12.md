## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in a different order and asserts that they are not equal. This test fails because the buggy `equals` function doesn't handle comparisons between DataFrames with columns in a different order correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to consider the order of columns in the DataFrames when comparing the blocks.


## Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # for each axis because axes might be in different order
    def canonicalize_axis(axis):
        return (
            axis.dtype.name,
            axis.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_axes = sorted(self_axes, key=canonicalize_axis)
    other_axes = sorted(other_axes, key=canonicalize_axis)

    if [ax for ax in self_axes if ax not in other_axes]:
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals` function to consider the order of axes and blocks in the `BlockManager` objects, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
