The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of columns in the `DataFrame` objects. The function is comparing the columns in a strict manner without considering the order of the columns.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of comparing the blocks in the `equals` function to check if the blocks are equivalent irrespective of their order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_block_dict = {block.name: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_dict = {block.name: block for block in other.blocks}

    for block_name, block in self_block_dict.items():
        if block_name not in other_block_dict:
            return False
        if not block.equals(other_block_dict[block_name]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will compare the blocks in a more flexible way, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly irrespective of the order of the columns in the `DataFrame` objects.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
