## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal, then consolidates the blocks and compares each block within them.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns having different data types and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method, which internally calls the buggy `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
4. The bug in the function occurs when sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which includes sorting based on `block.dtype.name`. This leads to wrong comparison based on data types.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function where sorting is done based on `block.dtype.name`, which might not be the right way to compare blocks with different data types. This causes the `equals` method to return incorrect results when comparing `BlockManager` objects with blocks having different data types.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle blocks with different data types appropriately. We can consider alternative approaches to sort the blocks for comparison in a way that ensures correct comparison irrespectively of data types.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
```
