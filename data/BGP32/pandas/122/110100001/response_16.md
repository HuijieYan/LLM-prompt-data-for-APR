The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the way it compares the blocks in the two instances of `BlockManager`. The function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the bug arises when comparing the blocks. The bug occurs because in the block comparison loop, it is trying to call the `equals` method on `block` and `oblock`, where `block` and `oblock` are instances of `Block` class which does not have an `equals` method defined. This causes an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks by their values directly instead of trying to call a method that doesn't exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not np.array_equal(self_blocks[i].values, other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the block values instead of trying to call an `equals` method on the `Block` instances.
