The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) based on their axes and blocks, which represent the underlying data structures of the DataFrame. However, the bug lies in comparing the blocks themselves. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and manager locations, but it fails to handle the case where the data within two blocks may be of different types but still logically equivalent.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual block values instead of just their data type names and manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on their values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) based on their block values rather than just their data type names and manager locations. This change should make the comparison more robust and fix the bug that caused the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
