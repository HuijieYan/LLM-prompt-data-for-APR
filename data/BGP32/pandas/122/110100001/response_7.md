### Analysis:
- The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
- The `equals` function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine equality.

### Bug:
- The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):` condition.
- When comparing the blocks, it does not account for the blocks being in a different order, which leads to false negatives in the equality check.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks in both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them.
- Sorting the blocks will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the order of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and correctly determine the equality of `BlockManager` instances.
