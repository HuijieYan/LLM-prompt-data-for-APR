### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method belonging to the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The comparison should return `False` because the columns have different datatypes, but the current implementation of the `equals` method fails to handle this case correctly.
4. The bug seems to be caused by not properly handling the case where the datatypes of corresponding blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considers the datatype along with the block contents.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to include datatype information while sorting the blocks.
3. Modify the comparison of blocks to compare both the data and the datatypes.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.dtype == oblock.values.dtype and block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should now correctly handle comparisons where blocks have different datatypes. The failing test should pass with this corrected version.
