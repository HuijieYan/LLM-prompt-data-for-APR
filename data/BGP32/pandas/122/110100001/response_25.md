The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The bug arises because the function is trying to access the `axes` attribute directly from the `BlockManager` objects through `self.axes` and `other.axes`, but the `BlockManager` class does not have an `axes` attribute defined within it.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the `equals` function to compare the `BlockManager` objects based on their `blocks` attribute, since the `BlockManager` objects store their data in blocks. The comparison logic needs to iterate over the blocks in both objects and check if they are equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def block_equal(block1, block2):
            return block1.equals(block2)

        return all(
            block_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will compare the `BlockManager` objects based on their blocks, ensuring that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass.
