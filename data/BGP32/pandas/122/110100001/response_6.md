The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly compare two DataFrames. The issue lies in the comparison of DataFrame `df1` and `df2` in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two DataFrames to determine if they are equal. However, it doesn't consider the data within the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrames in addition to the axes and blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare the actual data within the blocks
        equal_blocks = []
        for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not block1.values.equals(block2.values):
                return False
            equal_blocks.append(True)
        
        return all(equal_blocks)
```

By comparing the values within the blocks of the DataFrames, the corrected `equals` method will now accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal. This correction should make the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
