The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.

The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the values in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly compare the values in the DataFrames, rather than comparing them directly. One way to do this is by converting the DataFrames to numpy arrays and then comparing the arrays element-wise.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    try:
        for block_label in self_blocks:
            block = self_blocks[block_label]
            other_block = other_blocks[block_label]

            if not block.equals(other_block):
                return False
    except KeyError:
        return False

    return True
```

By comparing the individual blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly check for equality between two instances. This correction should resolve the issue causing the failing test.
