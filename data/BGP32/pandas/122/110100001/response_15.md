### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then sorts their blocks based on type name and manager locations.
3. The bug in the function is likely related to how it handles comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns of different types and expects them to be unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises because it relies on sorting the blocks based on type name and manager locations without considering the actual data within the blocks. This leads to incorrect behavior when comparing two `BlockManager` instances where the blocks may contain different data types or actual values.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks rather than just their types and locations. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `values` of the blocks in the corrected version, we ensure that the actual data within the blocks is compared for equality, addressing the bug in the original function.
