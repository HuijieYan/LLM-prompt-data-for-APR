The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class currently compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks, but it fails to handle the case where the blocks have different data types. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with different data types within their blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type name and the actual values within the block for comparison. This will ensure that blocks with different data types are treated as unequal even if their data type names are the same.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks based on both their data type names and actual values, ensuring that blocks with different data types are correctly treated as unequal.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, as it handles the comparison of blocks with different data types appropriately.
