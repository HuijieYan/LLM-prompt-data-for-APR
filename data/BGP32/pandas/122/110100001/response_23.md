The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the DataFrame blocks. The function is trying to check the equality of the blocks by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations, but the comparison is not handling the case where the blocks differ in shape or content.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle blocks that are not equal based on their content, not just their type and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtypes)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtypes)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their data types rather than just type name and manager locations. This ensures a more accurate comparison of the block content, leading to a correct result when checking for equality between two DataFrames.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
