The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`). The issue is that the function is comparing the attributes of the objects directly without considering the actual data within the blocks.

The bug occurs because when comparing the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, the function is only checking if the axes objects are equal, rather than comparing the data within the blocks. Similarly, when comparing the blocks themselves, it uses the `equals` method of the individual blocks, but it doesn't consider the actual data within the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to iterate over the blocks within each `BlockManager` object and compare the actual data within the blocks. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks in both `self` and `other` objects, and comparing the data within these blocks instead of simply checking if the blocks are equal based on their attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the blocks directly by iterating over them
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.values.equals(other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the actual data within the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`, ensuring a proper comparison of the content. The updated version should now pass the failing test that checks for inequality between two DataFrames.
