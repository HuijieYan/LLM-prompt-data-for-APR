## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. 
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks, and then compares each block for equality.
3. The bug appears to be in the sorting of blocks where it uses `block.dtype.name` which may not be sufficient to uniquely identify blocks.
4. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting may not be sufficient to uniquely identify and compare blocks, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
Modify the `canonicalize` function to include a more comprehensive way of identifying blocks for sorting. One approach could be to concatenate multiple block properties into a string and use that for sorting.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining block properties for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected `equals` function, the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances should now work correctly, passing the failing test.
