The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue lies in the comparison of the `blocks` attribute of each `BlockManager` object.

The problem arises from the sorting of the `blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. This approach may lead to incorrect results if the blocks are not consolidated in the same way.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that both `BlockManager` objects are consolidated before comparing their blocks. We can achieve this by calling the `_consolidate_inplace()` method on both objects before comparing the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now properly compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their consolidated blocks. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
