## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.
2. The `equals` method is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the method is comparing blocks in the wrong order leading to incorrect equality check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on a canonical order before comparing them.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.get_values().tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a canonical order before comparing them, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
