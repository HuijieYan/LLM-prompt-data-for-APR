The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. However, the cause of the bug is that it is not correctly handling the data type mismatches between blocks when comparing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function in `BlockManager` class to properly handle data type mismatches between blocks before comparing them. One possible strategy is to add a check to compare the data types of corresponding blocks before comparing their contents. If the data types do not match, the function should return False immediately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block.dtype != oblock.dtype:
            return False
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the data types of corresponding blocks before comparing their contents, ensuring that any data type mismatches will cause the function to return False. This fix should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
