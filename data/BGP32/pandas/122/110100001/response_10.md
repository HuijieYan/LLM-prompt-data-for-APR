The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects. The main issue lies in how the function is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

The function first checks if the number of axes in both `BlockManager` objects is the same. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`. Then, it proceeds to check if all the axes are equal in both objects. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.

The critical issue is with how the function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. It sorts the blocks based on a custom key function `canonicalize`, which combines the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting is intended to handle cases where there may be unconsolidated blocks and ensure a consistent order for comparison. However, the implementation of `canonicalize` is flawed as it is converting `mgr_locs` to a list using `.as_array.tolist()` instead of directly using it as a tuple.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to properly create a tuple representing each block for sorting. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison logic within the function is correctly comparing the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare `BlockManager` objects correctly based on their axes and blocks. The provided failing test case should pass after applying this fix.
