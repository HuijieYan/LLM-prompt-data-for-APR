The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The main issue lies in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison logic should consider the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` includes checking the content of each block within the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Update the logic to compare the blocks in a meaningful way, taking into account their content and not just their references.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# corrected version of the `equals` function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison should check the equality of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances rather than just comparing their references. This version should pass the failing test provided.
