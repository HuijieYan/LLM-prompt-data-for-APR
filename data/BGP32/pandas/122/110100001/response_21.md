### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and block data.
- The function first checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same, then compares each axis, and finally compares the blocks within the objects.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of axes and blocks, which leads to the incorrect result when checking for equality.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is in the implementation of the `equals` function where the method `canonicalize` is called to sort blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects.
- The `canonicalize` function compares blocks based on their data type name and the manager locations.
- However, the bug lies in the way manager locations are retrieved using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This approach fails to properly convert the manager locations to a list for comparison.
- As a result, even if two `BlockManager` objects have the same data but the manager locations are stored differently, the comparison fails. This leads to the incorrect output when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert manager locations to a list for proper comparison.
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on both data type name and the manager locations as lists to accurately determine equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update canonicalize function to correctly convert manager locations to a list
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to convert manager locations to a list using `values.tolist()`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
