## Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
- The function first checks if the number of axes in both objects are equal. If not, it returns False.
- Then, it checks if each axis in both objects are equal by iterating through them and calling the `equals` method on each pair of axes. If any pair is not equal, it returns False.
- After that, it consolidates the blocks in both objects.
- It then checks if the number of blocks in both objects are equal. If not, it returns False.
- Finally, it sorts the blocks in both objects based on a canonicalization function and compares each block to determine equality.

## Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is that it is comparing blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `equals` method, which may not work correctly for all types of blocks. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in a way that is more suitable for comparison. We can convert the blocks to arrays and compare these arrays for equality.
We can also update the sorting logic based on the canonicalize function to ensure consistent comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using a tuple of block values for comparison
    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version converts the blocks into arrays before comparison, ensuring a more reliable comparison method. This should address the bug and make the `equals` method in `BlockManager` class work correctly with the provided test case.
