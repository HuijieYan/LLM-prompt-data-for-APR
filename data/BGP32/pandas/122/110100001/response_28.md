### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The function takes another `BlockManager` object `other` as input and tries to compare the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, as indicated by the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
4. The error likely occurs when sorting and comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns of different types and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` function, which should return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely occurs when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, especially when sorting the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs`.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to address the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances to ensure that the equality comparison is done accurately based on the content of the blocks, considering the dtype and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version addresses the issue by sorting blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs` attributes to accurately compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This fix should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly.
