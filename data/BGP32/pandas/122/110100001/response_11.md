## Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` instead of `block == oblock`.
   - Sorting the blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize(block)` which might not produce the desired result.
3. The bug causes the `equals` function to return incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, especially when the data types are inconsistent.
4. To fix the bug, we should perform a direct comparison of blocks using `block == oblock` and avoid sorting the blocks.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block == oblock for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```
