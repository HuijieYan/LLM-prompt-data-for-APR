## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
3. The function fails the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test because it incorrectly compares the two `BlockManager` objects based on the order of their columns.
4. The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs, which may not correctly identify differences.
5. To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their actual content instead of their order.

## Solution:
```python
# Updated equals function to fix the bug
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content rather than order
    self_blocks_content = {block.axes[0]: block.values for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_content = {block.axes[0]: block.values for block in other.blocks}

    if self_blocks_content.keys() != other_blocks_content.keys():
        return False

    for key in self_blocks_content.keys():
        if key not in other_blocks_content:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self_blocks_content[key], other_blocks_content[key]):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By comparing the blocks based on their content rather than their order, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
