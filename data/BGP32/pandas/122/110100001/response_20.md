## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.
2. The bug lies in the way the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared. The comparison should consider both the block data and the manager locations to ensure the correct comparison.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns swapped and expects them to not be equal, but the current `equals` implementation fails to detect this.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly consider both the dtype name and manager locations array for comparison.
5. After updating the `canonicalize` function, we need to sort the blocks based on this updated logic and compare the sorted blocks in the `equals` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider dtype name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on both dtype name and manager locations to accurately compare the instances of `BlockManager`.
