### Error Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the function incorrectly returns `True` if the blocks within the managers are identical but located in different positions. This behavior contradicts the expected result, leading to failing tests.

The issue arises when comparing the blocks within the managers. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison logic in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, which can lead to different block locations being labeled as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to only consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations. One way to achieve this is to compare the blocks based on their internal data directly, ensuring that two identical blocks are considered equal even if they have different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
        
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version focuses on comparing the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on additional attributes that might affect equality differently. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
