### Bug Explanation:

The issue arises from the implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances using the `equals` function, the function erroneously returns `True` when the block data is identical but stored at different locations within the blocks.

In the failing test provided, `df1` and `df2` have the same block data but with different column order. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` in this case, but it incorrectly returns `True`.

The bug stems from the comparison logic within the `equals` function that does not account for block locations. It directly checks for equality without considering block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks with potentially different locations. Instead of comparing blocks directly for equality, we should compare them after sorting the blocks based on their content and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on the values, dtype name, and block locations of a block.
- The self and other blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function before comparison.
- The comparison is now done for each corresponding block in sorted order to correctly handle cases where block data is identical but stored at different locations.

By implementing this corrected logic, the `equals` function will properly handle comparisons between `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks stored at different locations, addressing the bug and ensuring correct behavior.
