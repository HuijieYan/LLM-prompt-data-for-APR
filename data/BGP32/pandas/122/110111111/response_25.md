To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where identical blocks with different locations are wrongly evaluated as equal. The comparison logic should focus on the content of the blocks rather than their specific locations within the data structure.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Get the blocks from the BlockManager instances
    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    
    # Make sure both BlockManagers have the same block types
    if set(type(b) for b in self_blocks) != set(type(b) for b in other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check if the blocks are equal regardless of their order
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other_blocks) 
        for block in self_blocks
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first ensure that the number of axes matches and that each axis is equal between the two instances. We then consolidate both instances to handle any internal data structure differences efficiently.

The key improvement is in the block comparison logic. We retrieve all blocks from both `self` and `other` instances and ensure that both instances have the same block types. We then iterate over each block from `self` and check if there is any matching block in `other` that equals it.

This modification ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their specific locations, addressing the bug indicated in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass successfully, and the function should behave as expected based on the provided test case and desired criteria outlined in the GitHub issue.
