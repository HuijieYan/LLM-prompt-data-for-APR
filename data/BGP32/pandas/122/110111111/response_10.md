The issue with the `equals` function arises due to a comparison that wrongly returns `True` when it should return `False`. The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances and then proceeds to compare the blocks within those managers. 

The cause of the bug lies in a discrepancy in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. While comparing the blocks, the function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks by their type name and location, assuming it would be unique. However, in cases when identical blocks have different locations, the comparison fails to recognize them as equal, leading to the wrong result.

To resolve this issue, the sorting mechanism needs to be adjusted to ensure that blocks are compared correctly regardless of their locations.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Combine block type name and values to create a unique identifier for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.internal_values.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are correctly compared based on a unique identifier that considers both the block type and values, allowing for the correct determination of equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
