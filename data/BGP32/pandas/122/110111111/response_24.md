The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail with the error message `assert True is False`. The issue arises from comparing the blocks in an inconsistent order, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

The root cause of the bug is that the blocks are sorted in a different order before performing the comparison, causing the function to return `True` even for dataframes that are not equal due to different block locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists are sorted consistently before comparing them. We can achieve this by creating a method to canonicalize the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, ensuring a stable and reliable comparison order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should properly compare the blocks in a consistent order, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
