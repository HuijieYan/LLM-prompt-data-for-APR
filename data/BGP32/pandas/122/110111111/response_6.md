The bug in the `equals` function is caused by comparing blocks without considering the actual content of the blocks and their order. The function just sorts the blocks based on a tuple of dtype name and mgr_locs, which might not be sufficient for determining equality. This leads to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different order.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks checks for actual content equality and not just the sorting order. Additionally, we should consider the order of comparison between blocks to make sure we are comparing corresponding blocks correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare the blocks based on their content and the locations, ensuring correct equality checks for DataFrames like the one in the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
