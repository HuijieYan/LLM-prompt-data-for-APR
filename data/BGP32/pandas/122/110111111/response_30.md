### Bug Explanation
The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. It fails to properly handle the case where the blocks are present in different order but are identical in content. This leads to the function returning `True` erroneously when the expected result should be `False`.

The issue arises from the sorting logic used to canonicalize the blocks based on dtype name and locations. Due to the sorting, identical blocks with different locations get compared incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `equals()` function to properly compare the blocks without relying on sorting. Instead, we can iterate over the blocks and compare them one by one while considering their content. This way, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified irrespective of their order or locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version compares blocks in a loop without sorting, ensuring that identical blocks are properly identified. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
