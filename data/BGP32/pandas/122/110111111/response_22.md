### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. When comparing the blocks for equality, it does not account for the different locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results. This issue is highlighted in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two DataFrames with the same values but in different locations are wrongly declared as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the block locations when determining block equality. By properly accounting for block locations, we can ensure an accurate comparison between the `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version of `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` conversion in the `canonicalize` function, enabling a proper comparison of block locations. By sorting the blocks based on this canonicalization, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considers the locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
