### Bug Explanation:
The bug appears to stem from the mismatch between the expected behavior of the `equals` function and its actual implementation. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal, then sorting and comparing the blocks within them. However, in the current implementation, the function incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks have the same contents but are in different locations.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies within the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function. The function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which might not properly handle cases where the blocks are identical but in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks accounts for their contents rather than their locations. One way to achieve this is to sort and compare the blocks based on their contents directly, rather than relying on the `dtype name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Function:
Here's a corrected version of the function that properly compares the blocks based on their contents:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on their contents
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks' values, ensuring that the `equals` function accurately determines if two `BlockManager` instances are equal in terms of content.
