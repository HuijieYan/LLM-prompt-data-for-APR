### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating both instances and comparing the number of blocks they contain, followed by sorting and comparing each block in them.
  
2. The failing test tries to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` but expects them to be unequal due to a different order of elements, which the current buggy implementation does not handle correctly. This leads to an assertion error.

3. The error message confirms that the comparison is mistakenly returning `True` instead of `False` even though the DataFrames should not be considered equal.

4. The buggy function incorrectly processes the blocks for comparison without considering cases where the block order might differ in the two objects, resulting in an incorrect equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly handle cases where the block locations might differ between the two `BlockManager` instances. We should update the comparison criteria to incorporate this variation to ensure accurate object equality checks.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected implementation now properly compares the blocks using a combined key of data type names and block locations to handle cases where the blocks may have different orderings. This adjustment ensures accurate equality checks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
