### Error Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares the equality of two BlockManager objects. 
2. It first checks if the axes of the two BlockManager objects are the same length and equal, which is correct.
3. Then it consolidates both BlockManager objects in place, potentially changing their internal structures but not returning any value.
4. After consolidation, it checks if the number of blocks in each BlockManager object is the same, which is valid.
5. Next, it attempts to canonicalize the blocks using a sorting mechanism based on block type and locations. This can fail due to incorrect comparison criteria, generating undesired results.
6. Finally, it compares each block from the sorted lists; however, the comparing logic might not be correctly implemented, leading to erroneous evaluations.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the flawed sorting mechanism while canonicalizing blocks using a key based on block type and locations which may differ, leading to incorrect comparisons during the equality check.

### Solution Strategy
1. Ensure consistent ordering of blocks for correct comparison by adapting the criteria for canonicalization.
2. Implement a robust comparison method to check the equality of blocks properly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Generate a unique key for each block based on content for comparison
    def generate_key(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=generate_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=generate_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function sorts the blocks based on a unique key generated from the block's content, ensuring consistent comparison when checking for equality.
