### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly.
2. In the buggy function, the comparison of axes and blocks seems to be flawed, leading to the incorrect assessment of equality.
3. The failing test creates two DataFrames with reversed data, expecting them to be unequal. However, the buggy function erroneously concludes that the DataFrames are equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for axes and blocks is correct and consistent with the expected behavior.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic used to compare axes and blocks in the `BlockManager.equals` function.
2. Update the comparison process to correctly identify differences in axes and blocks.
3. Test the corrected function to verify if it now correctly determines equality between two BlockManager instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function `equals`
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected `equals` function should properly handle the comparison of axes and blocks, ensuring that the instances of `BlockManager` are correctly evaluated for equality based on their internal data.
