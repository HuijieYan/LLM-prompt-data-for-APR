The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks with different locations assuming they are equal when they should not be. The bug causes the `DataFrame.equals` method to incorrectly return `True` for dataframes with identical blocks but different block locations. This leads to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the block locations of the blocks being compared. We can achieve this by appending the block's manager locations (mgr_locs) to the tuple used for sorting the blocks before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that dataframes with identical blocks will only be considered equal if the blocks are at the same locations. This change should make the `equals` function behave correctly and pass the failing test.
