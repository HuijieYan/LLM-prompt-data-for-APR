### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises from the fact that the order of the blocks is affecting the comparison. This leads to false positives where blocks with identical data but different locations are considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the block comparison to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their order. We can achieve this by comparing the content of the blocks themselves, ensuring that blocks with the same data are considered equal regardless of their order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if the blocks' content is equal
        self_ordered_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=str)
        other_ordered_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=str)
        
        return all(
            block1.equals(block2) 
            for block1, block2 in zip(self_ordered_blocks, other_ordered_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content (`key=str`), we ensure that blocks with the same data content are placed in the same order for comparison. This modification ensures that the `equals` function accurately compares the data within the blocks rather than their order.
