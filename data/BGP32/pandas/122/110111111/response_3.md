### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns in different orders and expects them to not be equal.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails; hence, `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True`.
- The buggy function compares axes and blocks without considering the order of columns, leading to the incorrect result in this case.
- The `equals` function needs to consider the order of columns in the comparison to correctly determine equality.


### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the fact that the function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class does not take into account the order of the columns when comparing two instances.
- The function sorts the blocks in the columns without considering the original order of columns, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the columns' order is considered during the comparison. One way to achieve this is to sort the columns before comparing the blocks to ensure that the order of columns is taken into account.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Check if the column labels match in the same order
    if self_axes[0].equals(other_axes[0]) and self_axes[1].equals(other_axes[1]):
        pass
    else:
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, self_axes[block.mgr_locs.index].get_indexer(block.items))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the function now considers the order of columns by sorting the blocks based on the original column order. This modification ensures that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances accounts for column order, resolving the bug.
