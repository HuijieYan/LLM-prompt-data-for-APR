The bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to comparing blocks in the incorrect order. The function is comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` with `other_blocks` without considering the order of columns within the blocks. This leads to false positives when blocks have the same data but are arranged differently.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly by matching the blocks based on their data, not just their positions. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks based on their data elements rather than comparing their ordered positions directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using column data instead of positions
    def get_block_key(block):
        dtype_as_str = block.dtype.name
        data_as_tuples = tuple(tuple(row) for row in block.get_values())
        return (dtype_as_str, data_as_tuples)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the comparison now considers the data within the blocks and returns `True` only when the blocks have the same data content, regardless of their positions or order.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and ensure that the `equals()` function works correctly, passing the failing test case provided.
