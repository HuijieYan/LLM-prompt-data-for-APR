The bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrect comparison logic that fails to properly handle the case where blocks are identical but located at different positions, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for both block equality and their respective locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with comments explaining the changes:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, manager locations, and block values to ensure correct comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the canonicalize function, we ensure that the comparison considers both block equality and their locations, which fixes the bug causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
