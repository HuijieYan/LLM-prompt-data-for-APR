The issue in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is that it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames. 

The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which relies on both the dtype name and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` value to distinguish blocks. Identical blocks with different locations result in a false mismatch when sorted.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for block comparison. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as different.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only dtype name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated `canonicalize` function, the `equals` method should now correctly compare blocks based on their dtype name, resolving the issue of returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
