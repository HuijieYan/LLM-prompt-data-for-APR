### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances that have identical blocks but different block locations.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different data types. When calling `equals()` on these instances, the function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`, triggering an assertion error.

The runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function indicate that the comparison logic is comparing the blocks based on their attributes, which results in the incorrect `True` return value.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize()` function should be modified to consider the content of the blocks when sorting them, rather than just their attributes. This change ensures that the blocks are compared accurately based on their actual data.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize blocks based on their data content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their actual values, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are appropriately identified as not equal. It should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
