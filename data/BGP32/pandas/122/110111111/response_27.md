The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the block order. This results in incorrect identification of identical blocks with different locations. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison accounts for the block order.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized key before comparing them to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This modification resolves the issue reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected behavior for the `equals` function.
