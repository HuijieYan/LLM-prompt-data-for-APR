### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the function is failing to correctly compare the blocks, leading to incorrect equality results when the block locations are different but the content is the same.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes in `self` and `other` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
2. It then tries to compare each axis element using the `equals` method. If any comparison returns `False`, the function returns `False`.
3. Next, it consolidates the blocks within `self` and `other`.
4. If the lengths of the blocks are not equal, the function returns `False`.
5. The function then sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` based on their types and locations.
6. Finally, the function compares the blocks pairwise and only returns `True` if all blocks are equal.

The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks. Since the sorting is based on the block type and location, blocks with the same content but different locations are considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks' content instead of their locations. We should iterate over the blocks in both `self` and `other` simultaneously and compare their content directly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize blocks based on their type for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we are directly comparing the blocks' content instead of their locations, ensuring that the equality comparison accurately reflects the block contents in both instances. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
