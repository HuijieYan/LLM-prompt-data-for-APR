### Explanation of the Bug:

The buggy `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations. This behavior is incorrect, as the method is expected to return `False` in such cases, as shown in the failing test function.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block's type name and `mgr_locs` is not considering the block's `mgr_locs` as expected. This leads to incorrect comparisons, resulting in the method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function takes into account the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks for correct sorting. By considering both the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` attribute during sorting, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as inequal and `False` is returned in such cases.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method that will address the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))  # Consider the mgr_locs for sorting
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method ensures that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as inequal during comparison. Consequently, the failing test provided should now pass as expected.
