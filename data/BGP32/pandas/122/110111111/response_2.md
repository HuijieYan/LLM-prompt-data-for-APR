The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The issue lies in how the blocks are being compared and sorted to check for equality.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When comparing the blocks, the function sorts them based on a key generated using the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting might not correctly handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations.
2. In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks but in different locations. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` because it does not properly account for block locations.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it evaluates to `True is False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing and sorting the blocks. Instead of comparing the block's `mgr_locs`, we should ensure the equality of the block data itself, disregarding its location within the DataFrame.

### Updated and Corrected `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Check axis equality
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if blocks are equal based on data, not location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        # Compare the block values directly
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the function should correctly compare the block values regardless of their locations within the DataFrame.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now return the expected output of `False` for the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
