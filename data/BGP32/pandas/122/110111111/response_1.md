The bug in the `equals` function is due to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, it fails to consider that the block locations might differ even if the blocks are identical, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for sorting the blocks. This change will ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using only the dtype name for sorting
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this change, the `equals` function will correctly compare the blocks based on their dtype names and ignore their locations, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
