To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to identify the root cause, which lies in how the block data is being compared and sorted. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations.

The issue stems from how the `canonicalize` function is implemented. The `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method within the `canonicalize` function is producing different results for identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect ordering when sorting the blocks. This incorrect sorting results in the function returning `True` incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly account for identical blocks with different locations. One way to address this is by sorting based on the block's content rather than the location. We can achieve this by using the block's values and dtype name to establish equivalence.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.flatten().astype(str), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values flattened to strings and their dtype names, we are ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are treated as equal. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected, passing the failing test.
