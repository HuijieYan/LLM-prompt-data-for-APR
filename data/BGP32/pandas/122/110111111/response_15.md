### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, in the failing test, it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have the same columns but with a different order.

#### Issue:
The issue arises because the function does not handle the case where the blocks may be in a different order within the DataFrames, resulting in a false positive equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to properly handle the case where the block order may vary between the compared instances. Sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes the block type name and locations can resolve this issue.

### Bug-free Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, the function sorts the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them, allowing for proper equality checks even if the order of the blocks varies.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now produce the correct results and pass the failing test case.
