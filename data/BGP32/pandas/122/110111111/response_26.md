### Explanation of the Bug

The bug is happening because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks of data represented by `self` and `other`. The comparison logic should consider the actual values within the blocks but instead is sorting and comparing them based on the type name and the manager locations.

In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns but with data swapped. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`, causing the assertion to fail. This occurs because the function compares the blocks based on their type and manager locations, not their actual content. The failure indicates that the function is not correctly handling the expected comparison between data blocks.

### Solution Strategy

To solve this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual block values instead of sorting based on type and manager locations. By iterating over the blocks and comparing their content directly, we can ensure that the function correctly determines equality between two BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now correctly compares the content of the blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the function works as expected and passes the failing test.
