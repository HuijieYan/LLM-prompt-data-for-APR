### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class which is used for managing labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays in pandas.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is not functioning as expected. Specifically, in the test case provided, the assertion that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` is failing.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The method does not handle the comparison of DataFrames with different data types in columns correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to consider both the data type and the content of the block when comparing them.
2. By modifying the comparison logic to handle the specific case of DataFrames with different data types, we can ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of the data type (converted to a string representation) and the byte representation of the block values for comparison.
2. By considering both the data type and the content of the blocks, the `equals` method can now correctly compare DataFrames with different data types in columns.
3. The comparison process now ensures a more robust and accurate evaluation of equality between blocks, which addresses the bug in the original implementation.
