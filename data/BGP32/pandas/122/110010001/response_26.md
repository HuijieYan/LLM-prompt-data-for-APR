### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library, which is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The error message is indicating that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.
3. The cause of the bug is related to how the function compares the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. The buggy code does not properly handle the comparison of different data types present in the blocks of the DataFrame.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for the data types and values within the blocks.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.view(np.array).dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block._equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function properly handles the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, considering the data types and values. It should now pass the failing test.
