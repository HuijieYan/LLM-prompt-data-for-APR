### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class.
- The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the `equals` function is not working correctly when comparing two dataframes that are not equal.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is defined and used within the `equals` function.
- The `canonicalize` function is intended to create a unique representation of a block based on its dtype name and manager locations.
- The bug arises from comparing the `manager locations` of the blocks in `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because `mgr_locs` is an attribute of an internal class and cannot be accessed directly as `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to handle `mgr_locs` correctly.
- We need to access `mgr_locs` properly to create a unique representation for each block.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version with fixed canonicalize function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify canonicalize to use dtype name and block shape
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now uses `block.shape` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to uniquely represent each block.
- This change ensures that the blocks are compared based on their dtype name and shape, effectively addressing the bug.
