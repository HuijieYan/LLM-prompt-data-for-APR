### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, implying that the `equals` function is not comparing the two dataframes correctly.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.
4. The cause of the bug might be due to improper comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function correctly matches the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. We can sort the blocks based on some property that can reliably compare them. In this case, sorting by type name and manager locations can help in identifying equivalent blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block types and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function using a consistent sorting approach for block comparison, the function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects. This fix should resolve the failing test.
