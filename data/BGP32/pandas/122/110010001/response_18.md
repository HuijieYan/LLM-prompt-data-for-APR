### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is inside the `BlockManager` class. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error message indicates that the comparison failed for two DataFrames due to a mismatch in values.

### Error Location:
The error is likely happening in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The error might be due to the sorted order of blocks obtained using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug causes the blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects to be compared in a way that doesn't consider the actual values of the blocks but instead uses block properties like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. This leads to incorrect comparisons and mismatch in values, which is why the test fails with `assert True is False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should compare the actual values of the blocks instead of sorting and comparing based on block properties like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(other_block.values) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the values of each block in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects directly instead of sorting and comparing based on block properties. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
