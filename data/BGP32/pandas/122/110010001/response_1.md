### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is not returning the expected result.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the mismatch in the data types of columns between the two DataFrames.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type of the column, not just the dtype name, to correctly compare the columns of the DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the column in addition to the dtype name.
2. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider this new format while comparing blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including data type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and block data while considering the data type of the columns as well.
