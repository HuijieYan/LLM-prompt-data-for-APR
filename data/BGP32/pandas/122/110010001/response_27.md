### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is returning `True`.
2. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
3. The `equals` function compares `self.axes` and `other.axes` which are not directly comparable for DataFrames. This leads to the incorrect result of the comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances rather than the axes.
5. Correct the comparison logic in the `equals` function so that it compares the actual data rather than the axes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to compare the actual data within the blocks rather than the axes.
2. Use a new comparison logic that extracts and compares the data stored in the blocks from both `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function will compare the actual data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring an accurate comparison.
