### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals()` method is resulting in an unexpected `True is False` assertion error.
3. The bug is likely due to the implicit use of the `equals()` method from the Pandas `NDFrame` base class, which may not be compatible with the custom implementation in the `BlockManager` class.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is made based on the custom equality criteria defined in the `BlockManager` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `equals(self, other)` method in the `BlockManager` class to perform the equality check based on the custom logic for comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Implement the comparison logic explicitly within the `BlockManager` class to ensure that the correct comparison method is used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class with the above implementation, the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances should now correctly evaluate their equality based on their axes and blocks, resolving the bug.
