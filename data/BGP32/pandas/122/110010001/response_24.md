### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the class. The error message is indicating that the comparison between two DataFrames using the `equals()` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the comparison logic in the `equals()` function is incorrect.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals()` method.
2. Possible issues with sorting and comparing blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic within the `equals()` function. The function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames, resulting in `True` being returned when the two DataFrames are not actually equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison logic properly handles the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames.
2. Verify that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.
3. Fix any issues related to the consolidation of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block._values.equals(oblock._values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function should address the comparison logic issues and ensure that the comparison between two instances of the `BlockManager` class works correctly.
