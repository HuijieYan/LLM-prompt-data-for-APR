### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. 
2. The error message is indicating that the comparison done by the `equals` function is failing when comparing two DataFrames, leading to an assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be that in the `equals` function, the comparison is done based on the blocks of the `BlockManager`. The issue might be related to how the DataFrame columns are being compared. The `equals` function is essentially comparing the contents of the blocks stored in the `BlockManager`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison is done correctly based on the actual data stored in the DataFrames rather than the blocks in the `BlockManager`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function so that it compares the data stored in the underlying DataFrames rather than the blocks in the `BlockManager`.
2. We can achieve this by accessing the `values` attribute of each DataFrame and comparing those values directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_data = np.vstack([df.values for df in self.blocks])
        other_data = np.vstack([df.values for df in other.blocks])
        
        return np.array_equal(self_data, other_data)
```

By directly comparing the underlying data in the DataFrames, we fix the bug in the `equals` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
