### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The error message is raised when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, indicating that the check for equality is failing.
3. In the buggy function, the issue arises when comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, or if the contents of the axes are not equal, the function returns False. However, the bug lies in the comparison of blocks where a sorting operation is performed to ensure the blocks are canonicalized for comparison. An incorrect approach was taken for canonicalization, leading to the failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the canonicalization logic for blocks to ensure a proper comparison based on the underlying data in DataFrames.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to canonicalize blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if each block equals the corresponding block in other_blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their type and location (mgr_locs) before comparisons are made, ensuring a proper canonicalization and equality check for DataFrames.
