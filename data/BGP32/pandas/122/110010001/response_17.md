### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The error message indicates that when comparing two dataframes using the `equals` method, it is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, where the block content is not matching, leading to the incorrect result during the comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual content of the blocks, not just their memory locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. In the `equals` method, modify the comparison of blocks to consider the actual content of the blocks.
2. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects and comparing each block's content using the `equals` method of the blocks themselves.
3. Return `False` if any of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not compare_blocks(block1, block2):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and return `False` if any of the blocks are not equal. It should pass the failing test.
