### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, implying that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` returned `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic between the blocks may not be working correctly.
2. Sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function could be causing an issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the comparison of blocks using `equals` method, as well as the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function. The incorrect comparison logic is causing the `equals` method to return `True` even when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks accurately determines if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. Additionally, the sorting of blocks should be done in a way that correctly identifies differences between the two instances.

### Update BlockManager Class:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.internal_values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should now correctly determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.
