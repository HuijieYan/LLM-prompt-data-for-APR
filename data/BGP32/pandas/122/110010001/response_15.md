### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function starts by comparing the `axes` of the two objects, then consolidates the data blocks and sorts them for comparison. The bug appears to be related to the equality check logic inside the function.

### Errors:
1. The function currently returns `True` when comparing two unequal `BlockManager` objects but it should return `False`.
2. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement in the test is failing because `True is False`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the equality comparison logic inside the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic inside the `equals` function to properly compare the `BlockManager` objects and return `False` when they are not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version above:
- Changed the `canonicalize` function to use the `get_values_hash` method to create a unique identifier for the blocks.
- Sorted the blocks based on the hash value for canonicalization.
- Used a more appropriate equality comparison within the `all` function to compare each block with the corresponding block from the other object.

This corrected version should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as intended.
