### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` function is resulting in an unexpected assertion error.
3. The error message specifically shows that `assert True is False`, suggesting that even though the DataFrames are not equal, the function is returning `True`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function might not be correctly handling the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. There could be issues with sorting, canonicalization, or the underlying equality check.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic of comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The issue may lie in how the blocks are sorted, canonicalized, or how the equality check is performed. This is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the blocks are not equal, leading to the failed assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the block comparison logic accounts for all possible scenarios that could make two `BlockManager` instances unequal.
2. Verify the sorting and canonicalization of blocks to ensure the comparison is accurate.
3. Validate the equality check method to guarantee correct comparison results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._hash()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.index.equals(oblock.index) and block.columns.equals(oblock.columns) and block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to use `_hash()` method to provide a unique representation for each block.
2. Updated the equality check to compare `index`, `columns`, and `values` of each block in the sorted order.
3. This version ensures a more robust and accurate comparison of two `BlockManager` instances.
