### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is attempting to check equality between two instances of the class by comparing their attributes like axes and blocks.
2. The error message is indicating a failure in asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` is False when trying to compare two DataFrames that have different values for the same columns.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the data blocks of the two DataFrames instead of the columns directly, leading to the `True is False` assertion failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to directly compare the values of columns rather than the internal blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `equals` method to directly compare the DataFrames based on the values in their columns.
2. This comparison can be achieved by checking if the column names are the same and then verifying if the values in those columns are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import make_block

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing code....

    def equals(self, other):
        # Check if column names are the same
        if list(self) != list(other):
            return False
        
        # Check if values in corresponding columns are equal
        for col in self.columns:
            if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method compares DataFrame columns directly by name and values, ensuring a proper comparison for DataFrame equality.
