### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is using the `equals` method from `axes`, `block` objects which is resulting in incorrect comparison.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal.
3. The bug is likely due to the usage of `equals` method incorrectly on certain attributes. The error message references `<bound method NDFrame.equals...>` which suggests that the `equals` method is not being called as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct `equals` method is being utilized and the comparison logic is correctly implemented.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to directly compare the blocks in a DataFrame rather than calling the `equals` method on axes and blocks.
2. Implement a custom block comparison logic by iterating over the blocks and comparing them individually.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.array_equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison will be done on the block level within the DataFrames, ensuring that the correct comparison logic is applied. This should address the bug and allow the function to correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal.
