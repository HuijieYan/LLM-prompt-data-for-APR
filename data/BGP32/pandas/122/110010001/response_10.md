### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
- The purpose of the `equals` function is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing because the comparison between two DataFrames is returning `True` instead of `False`.
- The issue might be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by inconsistencies in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. The comparison of axes and blocks may not be handling the DataFrame data correctly, leading to a misinterpretation of equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes takes into account the DataFrame columns.
2. Sort and compare the blocks based on the dtype.name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_ftype(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting and comparing the blocks based on the combination of dtype name and mgr_locs, we ensure that the comparison is done consistently across different block types and locations, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
