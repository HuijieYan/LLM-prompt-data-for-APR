1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The error message is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is returning `True`.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - Comparing blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.
   - Sorting blocks based on this comparison.
   - Using `equals` method to compare individual blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is that the blocks are being sorted incorrectly, causing the comparison to fail. The `equals` method expected a certain order of blocks, which was not being maintained due to incorrect sorting. This discrepancy led to the function returning `True` instead of `False`.

4. To fix the bug, we should not rely on sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. Instead, we should directly compare the blocks without sorting.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will directly compare the blocks without sorting, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly.
