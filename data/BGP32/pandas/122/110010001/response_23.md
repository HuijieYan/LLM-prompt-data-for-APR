1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py` of the pandas library. 
2. The potential error locations in the function are with the comparison of axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.
3. The bug is causing the test to fail because the `equals` method is incorrectly comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` element-wise instead of comparing the overall structures of two DataFrames.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing the structures of the two DataFrame instances and not the individual elements within them. We should compare the axes and blocks to determine if the two DataFrames are equal or not.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the correct comparison logic based on axes and blocks, the corrected `equals` function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test mentioned.
