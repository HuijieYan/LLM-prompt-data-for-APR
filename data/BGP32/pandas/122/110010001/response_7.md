1. The `equals` method is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This method is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their axes and internal blocks.

2. The potential error locations within the `equals` method could be:
   - Inconsistencies between `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
   - Inconsistencies between the number of blocks in `self` and `other`.
   - Sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function may not be accurate.

3. The cause of the bug is that the method is comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` from the test case, which have different values in corresponding places for columns 'a' and 'b'. The `equals` method called on these two DataFrames is expected to return `False` due to the values mismatch, but it mistakenly returns `True`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in a way that it properly compares the internal data blocks of the `BlockManager`.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` based on a combination of the block type name and location indices. This ensures a proper comparison between the internal data blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
