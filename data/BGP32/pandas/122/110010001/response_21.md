### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects. However, the function seems to be comparing the underlying blocks directly, which causes an issue when the DataFrame objects have columns with different data types or order.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames using the `.equals()` method failed.
3. The cause of the bug is most likely due to the direct comparison of blocks without considering the data types or order of columns in the DataFrames.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames based on their column order and data types, ensuring a more robust and accurate comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Sort the columns of both DataFrames based on their dtypes and axis order.
2. Compare the sorted columns and data to check for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_data = self.get_numeric_data().sort_index(axis=1)
    other_data = other.get_numeric_data().sort_index(axis=1)
    
    if not self_data.columns.equals(other_data.columns):
        return False
    
    return self_data.equals(other_data)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
1. The corrected function first sorts the numeric data of both `self` and `other` DataFrames based on their indices.
2. Then, it compares the columns of the sorted numeric data to ensure they are the same.
3. Finally, it uses the `.equals()` method to compare the sorted numeric data of both DataFrames for equality.

By sorting the columns and ensuring the comparison is based on numeric data, the corrected function should provide a more reliable check for equality between two DataFrames.
