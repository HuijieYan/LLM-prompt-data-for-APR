### Analysis:
- The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two BlockManager objects to check for equality.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` (DataFrames) using the `equals` method is not returning the correct result.
- The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True`, while it should return `False`.

### Error Cause:
- The error is caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.
- In this case, the issue arises from how the comparison of underlying blocks of data is being done.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The comparison of the underlying blocks of data should be corrected to ensure that mismatched blocks are detected to return `False`.
- The comparison function should effectively compare the blocks using appropriate attributes.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.shape == oblock.shape and block.values.data.tobytes() == oblock.values.data.tobytes()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issue by comparing the blocks based on their shape and content, rather than the dtype name and manager locations. This change should help in properly detecting differences in the underlying block data.
