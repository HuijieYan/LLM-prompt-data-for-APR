### Analysis:
- The buggy function named `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
- The error message is indicating that the test case is failing for comparing two dataframes using the `equals()` method.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in how the equality check is performed between the two `BlockManager` instances. When comparing two pandas dataframes, the ordering of columns is important and normal `equals()` method may not work as expected.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals()` method doesn't handle the case when the columns of the two dataframes are in different orders, leading to a false assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` method to sort the blocks based on column names or some other criterion that ensures the comparison is made correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.labels

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Added sorting of blocks based on column labels before performing `equals()` comparison.

### With this correction, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
