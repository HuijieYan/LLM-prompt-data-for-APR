### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The function checks if the axes are the same length and if all axes are equal using the `equals` method of the axes.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects fails even though they are not equal. This indicates a bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is comparing blocks using the `equals` method directly, but it should be comparing the values inside the blocks. The error message shows that the actual content of the dataframes is being compared, which is not the intended behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks instead of directly calling the `equals` method on the blocks themselves.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
        
        return all((self_block == other_block).all() for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This updated code snippet correctly compares the content of the blocks (values) instead of comparing the blocks directly. This should now fix the bug and make the test pass.
