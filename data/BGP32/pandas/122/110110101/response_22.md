### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes and blocks for equality. It fails to correctly compare the block contents due to the sorting logic based on `canonicalize` function.
2. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but `mgr_locs` is used incorrectly.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, showing the unexpected result of the comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks effectively based on their content.
5. I will correct the `canonicalize` function by considering the content of the blocks for comparison.

### Correction
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.astype(str)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function properly compares the blocks' content by converting the block values to strings for sorting using the `canonicalize` function. This correction should ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is done accurately based on their content.
