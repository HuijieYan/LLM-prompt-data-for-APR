### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first compares the axes of both objects and then compares the blocks within the objects.
   
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could arise from the comparison of axes, the sorting and comparison of blocks, and the handling of different block types.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` are created with columns swapped between data frames. When comparing these data frames using the `equals` method, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
   - The error message indicates that the comparison check is producing `True is False` which fails the assertion.
   - The expected behavior is for the function to correctly identify the data frames as unequal due to the mismatch in column values.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then compares the blocks themselves.
   - Additionally, handling the data type differences while sorting and comparing blocks will be crucial to ensure correct equality comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function 
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
            return False
        
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making the above corrections, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. Remember to maintain the expected input/output values provided for all relevant variables.
