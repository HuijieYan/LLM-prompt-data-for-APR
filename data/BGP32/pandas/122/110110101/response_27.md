### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The function compares the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` instances to determine equality.
2. The error occurs because the function compares the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, but the DataFrame values within the blocks are not compared correctly.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects them to be considered unequal. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrames, not just their metadata like dtype and mgr_locs. We should iterate over the values in the blocks for comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare the actual data in the blocks
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values of the blocks instead of their metadata, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and correctly identify the DataFrames as unequal.
