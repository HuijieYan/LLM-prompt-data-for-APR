The bug in the `equals` function is failing to handle the scenario when the blocks within the `BlockManager` are in a different order but still equivalent. The function currently sorts the blocks and compares them directly, which leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `equals` function first compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
2. It then consolidates both `BlockManager` objects in place.
3. Next, it compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
4. It then sorts the blocks based on their data type and location within memory using the `canonicalize` function.
5. Finally, it compares each block of one `BlockManager` with the corresponding block from the other `BlockManager`. If any pair of blocks are not equivalent, it returns `False`.

The bug lies in the sorting and comparison of blocks. It assumes that blocks must be in the same order in both `BlockManager` objects, which is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to account for the possibility that blocks can be ordered differently in the `BlockManager` objects but can still be equivalent. We should compare blocks based on their content rather than their order.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks based on content, not order
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    return all(
        any(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block2 in other.blocks)
        for block1 in self.blocks
    )
```

### Updated Explanation:
The corrected function now compares each block from one `BlockManager` with all blocks in the other `BlockManager` to find a matching equivalent block. This ensures that even if the blocks are in a different order in the two `BlockManager` objects, the comparison will still yield correct results. The function now correctly handles scenarios where blocks are equivalent but not necessarily in the same order.
