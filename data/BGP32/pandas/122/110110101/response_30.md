### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in columns 'a' and 'b' and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with the message: `assert True is False`.
4. The bug seems to occur in the comparison logic within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
  
### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks in a non-consolidated order, leading to a false positive result in the comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in a consolidated and sorted order during the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `self.get_blocks()` and `other.get_blocks()` to ensure the blocks are properly consolidated.
- We sort the blocks based on a canonicalization method to ensure consistent comparison.
- We then compare the corresponding blocks to check for equality.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
