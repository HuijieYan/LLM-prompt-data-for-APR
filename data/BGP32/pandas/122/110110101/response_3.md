### Bug analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. 
- The purpose of the `equals` method is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different data types in the columns and expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True is False`.

### Bug location
1. The comparison logic for the axes of two `BlockManager` instances seems correct.
2. The issue might arise from the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method which sorts the blocks before comparing them based on their dtype name and manager locations.

### Bug explanation
- The bug occurs because the buggy `equals` method does not account for the different types of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other` when comparing them. 
- The sorting of blocks based on dtype name might lead to incorrect results when blocks have different data types but can still be equal.

### Bug fix strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to consider the actual equality of the blocks rather than just sorting them based on dtype name. 
- We should loop over the blocks and compare them directly, ensuring that their dtype matches before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if block.dtype != oblock.dtype:
            return False
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `equals` method, we directly compare the blocks ensuring they have the same data types before checking for equality, which should address the bug in the faulty comparison logic.
