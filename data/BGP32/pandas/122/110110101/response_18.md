### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes and blocks.
2. The error occurs when comparing two `DataFrame` instances in the test function. The `equals` method is expected to return `False` because the column data types are different in the two `DataFrame` instances.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because `True` is not equal to `False`.
4. The bug is caused by not properly handling the comparison of different data types in the blocks inside the `BlockManager`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where the data types differ between blocks.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding a type conversion for `block.values.dtype` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison considers the data types as strings, enabling a correct comparison between the blocks. This correction addresses the bug and allows the function to handle cases where the block data types may differ.
