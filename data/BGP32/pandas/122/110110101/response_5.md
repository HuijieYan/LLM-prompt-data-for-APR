### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates the blocks within each object to facilitate comparison. However, there is a bug in the `canonicalize` function where the `block.dtype.name` is accessed directly, causing an AttributeError due to `IntBlock` not having a `name` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types correctly. We should check the type of the block before accessing its `dtype.name` attribute, and depending on the block type, we can construct a suitable key for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):  # Check the block type
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (type(block).__name__, None)  # Handle other block types

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating type checks in the `canonicalize` function and handling different block types correctly, we ensure that the function works correctly for a variety of block types, fixing the bug.
