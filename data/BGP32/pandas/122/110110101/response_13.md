### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the values within the blocks. The function is not comparing the actual values within the blocks but rather the attributes of the blocks themselves, which leads to the incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual values within the blocks, rather than comparing block attributes like dtype or mgr_locs. We need to iterate through the blocks and compare the values element-wise to ensure that the content of the blocks is indeed equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

By iterating through the blocks and comparing their element-wise values, the corrected function ensures that the content of the blocks is checked for equality, leading to the correct comparison results.
