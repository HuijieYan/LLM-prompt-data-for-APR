### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs due to a mismatch in the order of blocks between `self` and `other`. The function first compares the axes of both `self` and `other`, then consolidates the blocks in both objects and compares their lengths. However, after consolidating the blocks and before comparing them, the function sorts the blocks based on their dtypes and manager locations. This sorting operation can change the block order, leading to incorrect comparison and equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the block order remains the same during the comparison process. One way to achieve this is by directly comparing the blocks without sorting them. This way, we can maintain the original order of blocks in both `self` and `other` objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks from `self` and `other` without sorting them, we ensure that the block order is consistent and the comparison is done correctly. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
