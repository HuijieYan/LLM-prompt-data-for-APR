The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail because the function does not handle the case where the DataFrames have columns with different types.

The bug is happening because the `equals` function is assuming that the order of the blocks in the DataFrames is consistent, which may not be the case when the DataFrames have columns with different types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the shape of the blocks when sorting them. This change will ensure that blocks with different types are not erroneously considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass as expected.
