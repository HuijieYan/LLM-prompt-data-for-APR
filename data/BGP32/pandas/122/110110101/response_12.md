The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames where the column data types are swapped between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The buggy function currently does not handle this scenario properly, leading to a false assertion failure in the test.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `equals` function compares the axis labels of `self` and `other` DataFrames. If the labels are not equal, it returns `False`.
2. It then consolidates the blocks in `self` and `other` DataFrames and compares the number of blocks. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. Lastly, it compares each block of `self` with the corresponding block of `other`. However, it uses a canonicalization function based on block dtype and location which does not handle the scenario where column data types are swapped.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider both the column dtype and the column label. By including the column label in the comparison, we can ensure that even if the column data types are swapped between `self` and `other`, the comparison will still be accurate.

### Corrected Version of the equals Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, label):
        return (label, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, label) for label, block in self.blocks.items()], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, label) for label, block in other.blocks.items()], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, label), (oblock, olabel) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks) if label == olabel
    )
```

By including the column label in the canonicalize function and sorting the blocks based on both dtype, location, and label, we can accurately compare DataFrames even if the column data types are swapped. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
