### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is due to the comparison between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. Specifically, the bug arises when sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` key function, where the `BlockPlacement` object's `as_array` method needs to be called to get the list representation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the list representation of the `mgr_locs` attribute using the `as_array` method before converting it to a list. This will ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted based on their type name and location.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By fixing the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the `mgr_locs` attribute to a list, the `equals` method should now work as expected and pass the failing test case.
