### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns `a` and `b` having different types of values in different orders and expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
3. The failing test raises an assertion error because the buggy `equals` function is not handling the comparison of data blocks correctly, leading to a wrong comparison result.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison of the `blocks` attribute within the `equals` method.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is sorting blocks based on `canonicalize` function that uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` properties, but it fails to correctly compare the actual block data.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual block data within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. We should compare the values within the blocks for equality instead of relying on sorting blocks based on their properties. 

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the block data for equality, the corrected `equals` function will now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test.
