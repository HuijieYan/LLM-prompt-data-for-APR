### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is occurring because of the way it's comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The function attempts to compare the attributes of two `BlockManager` instances like `axes` and `blocks` without considering that these attributes may contain nested objects (like `Index`, `RangeIndex`, etc.) that need to be compared in a structured way.

The failing test case is comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have the same columns but in a different order. The `equals` function is expected to detect this difference and return `False`, but due to the bug, it's returning `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comparisons of nested objects like `Index` and `RangeIndex` are performed correctly. Additionally, the comparison logic for the `blocks` attribute (which contains `Block` objects) needs to be updated to properly check for equality based on the contents of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        # Check for equal type and values for each block
        return block.dtype == oblock.dtype and block.values.equals(oblock.values)

    block_cmp = [block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)]
    # Return False if any blocks are not equal
    if not all(block_cmp):
        return False
    return True
```

By modifying the `equals` function to properly compare the nested objects within `BlockManager` like `axes` and `blocks`, and to compare the blocks based on their type and values, we can ensure that the corrected function will pass the failing test case.
