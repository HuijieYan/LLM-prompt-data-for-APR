### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances, checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are equal.
- The bug arises because the function is not handling the case where the blocks may be in a different order in the two `BlockManager` instances. This is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, meaning the function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
- The expected values and types mentioned for the input parameters and variables are valid during the failing test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks' order is consistent when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After incorporating the sorting of blocks using a canonical representation, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and return the expected boolean value.
