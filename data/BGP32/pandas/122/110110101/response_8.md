### Fixing the bug
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of the data blocks in the `BlockManager` instances. The function should ensure that the data blocks are sorted and then compared. Additionally, the bug is also related to the comparison of axes in the `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug:
1. Sort the data blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances before comparing them.
2. Compare the axes of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances to check if they match.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the function now ensures that the axes of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances are correctly compared and also sorts and compares the data blocks before returning the result.
