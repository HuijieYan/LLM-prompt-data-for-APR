### Explanation:
The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by iteratively checking their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises due to the sorting of blocks in both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function. This function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which may lead to incorrect comparisons, especially for blocks with different data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type of the blocks only for comparison. This will ensure that blocks are sorted based on their data types only, allowing for a correct comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.dtype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code only considers the `dtype` of the blocks for sorting the blocks in both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This change ensures that blocks are compared based on their data types, leading to a correct comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
