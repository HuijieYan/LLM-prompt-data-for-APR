### Analysis
- The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` package is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances that are intentionally not equal and asserts that the `equals()` function returns `False`, which indicates their inequality.
- The error message shows that the assertion failed because `True` was returned instead of `False`.
- The function fails to correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, causing unexpected behavior in the equality comparison.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug lies in the sorting logic within the `equals()` function. The blocks are being sorted based on dtype name and manager locations, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
- This sorting mechanism does not ensure a proper comparison of the block contents between the two instances, leading to a faulty equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function used for sorting the blocks. Instead of using both dtype name and manager locations, we should focus on a more suitable comparison metric.
- It might be better to compare the block contents directly or a combination of dtype and shape to ensure a proper comparison between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def block_equal(block1, block2):
            return block1.equals(block2)

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        return all(block_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Correction Rationale
- We removed the sorting based on dtype name and manager locations from the `canonicalize()` function and maintained direct comparison of blocks within the `block_equal()` function.
- The corrected version of the `equals()` function now directly compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances for equality, ensuring a more reliable equality check.
