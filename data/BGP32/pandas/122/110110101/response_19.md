### Analysis
The buggy `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes of both objects first, then consolidates the objects, sorts and canonicalizes the blocks, and finally compares each block for equality.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different data types and then asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` function. The error message indicates that the assertion fails.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison of axes: The function compares the axes of `self` and `other` BlockManager objects.
2. Consolidation of objects: Both objects are consolidated before comparison.
3. Sorting and canonicalization of blocks: The blocks are sorted and canonicalized before comparison.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle DataFrames with columns of different data types correctly. When comparing axes, the function only checks the lengths of the axes. However, when consolidating the objects, it does not account for the different data types in the blocks. As a result, the blocks are sorted and compared in a way that does not consider the different data types, leading to the incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the different data types of the blocks in the `equals` function. We should improve the comparison mechanism to consider the data type of each block during consolidation and sorting to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (str(block._block_type()), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, a new function `canonicalize_block` is introduced to return a tuple that includes the block type and locations to ensure the correct sorting based on block type. The blocks are then sorted based on this canonicalization before comparison. This fix addresses the issue of comparing DataFrames with columns of different data types and should now pass the failing test.
