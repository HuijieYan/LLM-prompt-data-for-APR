The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the data blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to compare the content of the blocks correctly, leading to the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy `equals` function fails when comparing the data blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It uses the `sorted` function on the blocks without considering the content. Hence, it compares the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs without checking the actual values in the blocks. This causes the test to fail because the data values are different between `df1` and `df2`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to compare the data values within the blocks rather than just sorting them based on dtype and block locations. We should compare the values within each block to ensure that the content matches.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
        return block1.values_equals(block2)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, I added a new helper function `blocks_equal` that compares the values within individual data blocks. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data content rather than just the block metadata. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function behave correctly in comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
