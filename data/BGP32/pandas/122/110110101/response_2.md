### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It compares the axes and blocks of both `BlockManager` instances to determine equality.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'. It then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.

3. The failing test is due to the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function compares the `blocks` attribute of two `BlockManager` instances based on the order of blocks, which results in inconsistencies when the blocks are not in the same order.

4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance before comparing them in the `equals` function. This will ensure that the comparison is consistent regardless of the block order.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the `blocks` attribute of both `BlockManager` instances based on a canonicalized representation before comparing them.
2. Update the `equals` function to consider the sorted order of blocks while checking equality.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the canonicalized representation before comparison, the corrected function will provide consistent results regardless of the block order in the `BlockManager` instances.
