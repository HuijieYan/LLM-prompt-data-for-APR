### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is trying to compare two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) by checking if their axes are equal, the number of blocks are equal, and then iterating over each block to check if they are equal. The main bug is in the comparison of blocks due to their order being different between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Explanation
1. The comparison of blocks is done based on a sort order determined by the `canonicalize` function which combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` of the block.
2. In the failing test, we have two `DataFrame` objects with columns in a different order. When comparing the two `BlockManager` objects of these `DataFrame` objects, the order of blocks doesn't match due to the columns being in a different order. This causes the comparison to fail even though the data is equivalent.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks more intelligently, taking into account the columns (axis labels) when sorting the blocks. We can sort the blocks based on the columns they correspond to. This will ensure that blocks are compared accurately regardless of the column order.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks based on corresponding column names
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: list(block.items))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: list(block.items))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After sorting the blocks based on the corresponding column names, the corrected version of the `equals` function can accurately compare two `BlockManager` objects, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
