### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class which is used to check if two BlockManagers are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes of two BlockManagers and then compares their blocks. There seems to be an issue with the comparison logic.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'. It then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False. The error message shows that the assertion failed with `True is False` indicating that the `equals` method returned True when it should have been False.
4. To fix the bug, we need to improve the comparison logic to correctly identify differences between the BlockManagers.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes) or not all((ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes))):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
``` 

This corrected version ensures that both the axes and blocks of the two BlockManagers are compared correctly to determine if they are equal.
