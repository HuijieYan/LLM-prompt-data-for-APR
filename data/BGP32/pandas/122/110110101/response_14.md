### Explanation:
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The error occurs because the function does not handle the case where the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are in a different order, leading to a false positive comparison result.

The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames with different values but the same columns. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used internally by Pandas to compare the underlying blocks of the DataFrames. However, the function does not take into consideration the order of the blocks, resulting in a false positive comparison.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are compared in the correct order. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks based on a defined key (e.g., block type and location) before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is done in the correct order. This should fix the error encountered in the failing test case.
