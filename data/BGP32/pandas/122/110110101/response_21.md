### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the equality check between two `DataFrame` objects.
3. The error occurs because the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The failing test expects the two `DataFrame` objects to be considered unequal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class correctly compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

### Bug
The bug is in the `equals` function where it fails to compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects correctly.

### Solution
We need to update the `equals` function to compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

### Updated Test Function
The test function remains the same as it is correctly verifying the inequality of two `DataFrame` objects.

By updating the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, the corrected version provided should pass the failing test and compare `BlockManager` objects correctly for equality.
