### Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances and then sorts and compares their blocks. Any differences in axes or blocks should return `False`.
3. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different column order and expects the `equals` function to return `False`, as the dataframes are not equal.
4. The error occurs because the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of axes and blocks leading to a mismatch in the expected result.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly compares axes and blocks for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `equals` function to compare axes properly and then sort and compare blocks to check for equality.
2. Make sure the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly to satisfy the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
