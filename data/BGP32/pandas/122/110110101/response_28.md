### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The bug arises because the `block(dtype='int64')` does not have an attribute named `name` which is being accessed in the `canonicalize` function. This results in an AttributeError and the function fails to complete successfully.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle the case where the block's dtype does not have a `name` attribute. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple based on the block's dtype directly instead of accessing the `name` attribute.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block.dtype).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class should work correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
