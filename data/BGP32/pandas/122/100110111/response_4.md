### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` by checking if their axes are equal and if all blocks within them are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b`, but with values switched between the columns. It then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`, indicating the DataFrames are not equal.
3. The failing test provides an error message showing that the assertion `True is False` failed, indicating the equals function incorrectly returned `True`.
4. The bug is likely due to the comparison logic within the `equals` function not handling the mismatch in values between columns properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison logic inside the `equals` function not considering the values within the blocks of the DataFrames. The function only sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may not reflect the actual content of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be adjusted to compare the contents of the blocks rather than just sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This way, the function can accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal or not based on their actual values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block.to_frame(), oblock.to_frame()) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function compares the data within the blocks by converting them to DataFrames using `to_frame()` and then using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` for the comparison. This ensures that the actual values within the blocks are compared accurately.
