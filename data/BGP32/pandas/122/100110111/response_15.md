### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It checks for equality based on the content of `self.axes`, `other.axes`, and the `blocks` attribute of both instances.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different contents and expects their `equals` method to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and the actual value received was `True`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic within the `equals` method, which fails to correctly identify that the `DataFrame` objects are not equal due to different content.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` method comparing the two `BlockManager` objects without considering the actual content inside the blocks. It relies solely on the comparison of axes and block locators, which can lead to incorrect equality evaluations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the equality check in the `equals` method to consider the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Prioritize comparing the content over block metadata like locators.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adjusting how `canonicalize` function generates comparison keys, we ensure that the equality comparison considers the actual values within the blocks. This correction should resolve the issue and make the `equals` method return the expected results.
