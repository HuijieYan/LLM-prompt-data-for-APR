### Error Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects which handle the internal data blocks in a DataFrame.
- The error occurs in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
- The issue is that the block order is not being correctly canonicalized for comparison, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
- The failing test case expects the comparison of two DataFrames with different column data types to return `False`.
- The failing assertion message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, a consistent canonicalization method needs to be used to compare data blocks for equality.
- The issue likely arises from sorting based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`, where the latter may vary even for identical blocks.
- Ensuring a stable sorting criterion for block comparison can resolve the issue.
- Modification should consider the data type and values of the DataFrame blocks for appropriate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block.block), str(block.mgr_locs), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block_as_frame, other_block_as_frame, check_dtype=False)
        for in block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        for block_as_frame, other_block_as_frame in zip(block, other_block)
    )
```

### Updated Note:
- The corrected version utilizes `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` for comparing data block values.
- Sort the blocks based on data type, location, and values to ensure consistent comparison.
- The `check_dtype=False` argument in `assert_frame_equal` ignores column data type differences for this specific use case.
