### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects, which consist of axes and blocks. The issue arises from the way blocks are sorted before comparison, leading to incorrect results. The failing test compares two DataFrames that have columns with different values, expecting the function to return False, but it fails due to the buggy behavior.

### Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks using a custom function.
3. Block canonicalization during comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is sorting the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function, which uses a combination of the dtype name and mgr_locs to distinguish unique blocks. When the block data contains different values but the same dtype (e.g., int64), the custom sorting does not accurately represent the content differences, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual content rather than relying on the custom sorting function. This can be achieved by comparing blocks directly without sorting them using the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version avoids sorting blocks and directly compares them based on their content. It should now correctly identify differences between the DataFrames leading to a successful test run.
