### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the `equals` function incorrectly returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug causes unexpected behavior in comparing DataFrame blocks due to differences in column order.
5. The GitHub issue highlights this bug where the `equals` function returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `equals` function not considering the column order when comparing DataFrames. Since the function sorts blocks based on a canonicalized key, differences in block locations due to column order are not handled correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and column names for identifying blocks uniquely.
2. Update the sorting mechanism for the blocks using the modified `canonicalize` function.
3. Ensure that the comparison between corresponding blocks includes handling changes in column order.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    columns1 = sorted(self_axes[0].values)
    columns2 = sorted(other_axes[0].values)
    if columns1 != columns2:
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtypes), str(block._block_values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the changes in the `canonicalize` function and refining the block comparison process, the corrected function addresses the bug. This version should now pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values described above.
