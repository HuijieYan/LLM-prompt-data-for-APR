### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is trying to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal based on different attributes like axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is creating two DataFrames with different data types in the columns and expecting the `equals()` function to return False.
3. The error message indicates that the assert statement in the failing test is checking for `True is False`, which is incorrect.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to return False when comparing DataFrames with different column data types.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals()` function is returning True instead of False when comparing DataFrames with different column data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals()` function not correctly handling the comparison of DataFrames with columns of different data types. It fails to return False in this scenario, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to handle comparisons between DataFrames with different column data types. Specifically, we need to add a check to return False when encountering columns with different data types during the comparison process.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version incorporates the comparison of column data types into the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that the function correctly identifies DataFrames with different column data types and returns False in those cases.
