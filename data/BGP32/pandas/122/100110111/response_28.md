### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two data structures. In this case, it compares axes and blocks within two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data types in the columns `a` and `b`, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison logic for blocks within the function, as it fails to handle DataFrame comparisons with different data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not consider the data types when comparing the blocks. It only relies on the `equals` method of the blocks directly, leading to incorrect comparison results when the data types are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic inside the `equals` function to also consider the data types of the blocks being compared. This change will ensure that DataFrame comparisons with different data types in columns return the expected result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding the data type of the block to the comparison key in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with different data types are not considered equal. This correction addresses the bug and aligns the function behavior with the expected output of the failing test.
