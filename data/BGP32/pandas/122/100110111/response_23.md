### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function implementation is comparing the blocks of data directly without considering the order of the columns in the DataFrames. This leads to incorrect results when DataFrames have identical blocks but the order of columns is different.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames with the same data but in different column order, expecting the result to be `False`, but due to the bug, it fails.
3. The error message indicates that even though the expected result is `False`, the actual result is `True`.
4. The bug causes the function to compare data blocks without considering their locations properly, leading to False positives in equality checks when the column order is different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the actual locations of the blocks in addition to their contents. By sorting the blocks based on their canonical order, we can accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal even if the column order is different.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrames by considering the locations of blocks in addition to their contents, allowing it to pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
