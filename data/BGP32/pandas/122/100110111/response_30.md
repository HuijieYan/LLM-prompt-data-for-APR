### Identified Issue:
The `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the values of the DataFrames `self` and `other` without considering the order or the data types of the columns, leading to a false positive result.

### Cause of Bug:
1. The buggy function uses `zip` to pair axes from `self` and `other`, assuming the order should be the same, leading to incorrect comparison when the columns are in the different order in the DataFrames. This can be seen in the provided failing test where the DataFrames have the same values but in a different column order.

2. The bug involves incorrect sorting of the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, assuming that the order should be consistent across different DataFrames, which leads to incorrect comparison in the presence of unconsolidated blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison checks for data content rather than considering the order or types of the blocks. Removing unnecessary sorting based on type name and locations should also resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By removing the unnecessary sorting based on type name and locations, the corrected function compares the blocks directly for equality, ensuring that the comparison is based on the content of the DataFrames rather than arbitrary sorting. This should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
