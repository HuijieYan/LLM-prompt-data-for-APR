### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects, checking if their axes, blocks, and block orders are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in the same columns and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails with `assert True is False`, showing the mismatch in expected and actual results.
4. The bug seems to stem from the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, where it incorrectly returns `True` even when the axes and block data differ.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class does not handle the comparison of data blocks correctly. It only checks if the number of blocks is the same and sorts the blocks based on block characteristics before comparing. However, it fails to check the actual data inside the blocks, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects.
2. Check for equality at the block level to ensure that the content of corresponding blocks is the same.
3. Update the logic to compare both the block types and the actual data, not just the block characteristics.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_data_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs) and block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block_data_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function now includes a `block_data_equal` helper function that compares the actual data values within the blocks. It ensures that the equality check at the block level also compares the block contents, not just their characteristics. This modification aims to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue by providing accurate comparisons between `BlockManager` objects.
