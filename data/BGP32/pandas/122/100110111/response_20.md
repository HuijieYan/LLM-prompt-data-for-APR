### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`, for equality.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` constructs two DataFrames with columns in a different order and expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
- The expected values and types of variables at various points provide insights on the correct behavior.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is returning incorrect results for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug seems to be related to how the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are determined and compared.
- The current sorting mechanism may not be considering the order of the columns in the DataFrame blocks.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not considering the order of the columns. This can result in different blocks being treated as equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to come up with a reliable way to compare block equality that takes into account not just the block's content but also the column order in the DataFrame blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare sorted blocks based on dtype names and column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_dict(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version handles block comparison more effectively by considering both dtype names and column order to canonicalize blocks for comparison. It should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
