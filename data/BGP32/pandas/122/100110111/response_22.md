### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The main issue lies in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. Still, in case of unconsolidated blocks, these can be equivalent despite different locations due to the Categorical data type. This error leads to incorrect comparisons, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function assumes that sorting and comparing blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` is sufficient for equality. However, unconsolidated blocks like Categorical can have equivalent values but reside in different locations.
2. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` was expected to assert `df1.equals(df2) is False` since the two DataFrames are different. But due to the bug in the `equals()` function, it incorrectly returns `True` for the comparison.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` failed. This mismatch happens because the function returns `True` even though it should be `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle unconsolidated blocks properly, specifically for cases like Categorical data types that might have equivalent values but different locations.
2. Implement a better equality check that doesn't rely solely on dtype and `mgr_locs` but also considers the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtypes.item())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and block.dtypes.item() == oblock.dtypes.item() 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals()` function includes a new `canonicalize` function that considers the block values and dtype for sorting. The comparison step now uses `np.array_equal()` to check if the values are the same and directly compares the dtypes.

This correction should address the issue encountered in the failing test case and align with the expected behavior.
