### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two different DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method, which should return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement failed because `True` is being compared with `False`, and it shows the internal representation of the DataFrame objects, but the buggy function is not returning the expected result.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the function is erroneously returning `True` when comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects in `equals` function. The function currently sorts and compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might be incorrect for the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the function return the correct result:
1. Ensure that the comparison in `equals` ignores the block locations and only compares the content of the blocks.
2. Modify the block comparison logic to focus on the actual block values rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the updated version of the `equals` function with the necessary modifications:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, oblock_content)
        for block_content, oblock_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the block contents of the BlockManager objects without considering the block locations. This fix should address the bug and make the function return the expected result for the failing test case.
