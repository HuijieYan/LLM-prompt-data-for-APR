### Identified issue
The buggy function `equals` fails to correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It mistakenly assumes the equality of the blocks based on their type and location without considering their actual content.

### Bug cause
The bug arises from the comparison logic within the `equals` function. It falsely assumes that blocks should be considered equal if their types and locations match. In reality, the data within the blocks should be compared for equality.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides a DataFrame `df1` and `df2` with different values in the columns 'a' and 'b'. Since `equals` function only checks the ordering based on types and locations, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` as expected.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the contents of the blocks in addition to their types and locations. This can be achieved by comparing the actual data within the blocks instead of just their characteristics.

### Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.as_array.tolist() == oblock.as_array.tolist()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now compares the contents of each block in addition to their dtype and locations. This will ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result based on the actual data within the blocks.

By implementing this fix, the function should now return `False` for the provided failing test case.
