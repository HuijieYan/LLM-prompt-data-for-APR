### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes that have different values in the same columns.
3. The error message states that `assert True is False`, indicating that the current implementation incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug occurs because the function is not properly comparing the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `DataFrame.equals()` returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. If the block order is different or the blocks themselves are different objects but with identical content, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the content of the blocks instead of just their locations. By comparing block content, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies differences between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, sort blocks by values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on their content values, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly. This adjustment should resolve the bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly identified as equal.
