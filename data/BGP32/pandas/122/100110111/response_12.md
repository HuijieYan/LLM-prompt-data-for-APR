### Analysis
The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances in pandas. The function compares the axes of the two instances and then consolidates the blocks before comparing them. The issue arises when comparing the blocks, as the block order is not canonicalized, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects them to be considered unequal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison is incorrectly evaluating them as equal and causing the test to fail with an assertion error.

### Error
The error stems from the fact that the `equals` method is comparing the blocks directly without considering the order of the columns in the DataFrames. This results in the DataFrames being considered equal even though their column orders differ.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to first canonicalize the block order based on the column dtypes and locations. This will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly regardless of the order of the columns in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on dtype names and mgr_locs, we ensure that the block order is canonicalized before comparison. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly in the given test case.
