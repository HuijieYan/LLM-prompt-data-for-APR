### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the buggy `managers.py` file is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test in `test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different data types in the columns and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the `assert` statement fails, indicating that the function returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The cause of the bug lies in how the function handles comparing blocks with different data types and locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not consider the case where blocks with different data types are compared. The comparison of blocks with different data types should lead to a `False` result, but the current implementation ignores this.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to account for blocks with different data types. You can add an additional check to compare block data types as part of the sorting process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the added check for block data types in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different data types and locations.
