### Analysis:
1. **Bug Description**: The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects representing DataFrame blocks. The issue arises because the function does not consider the order of the blocks while comparing. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on dtype and manager locations, but it might result in an incorrect comparison.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug is primarily located in the sorting and comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug occurs due to the fact that the `equals` function does not handle the comparison of blocks correctly when the order of the blocks is different between two DataFrames. This leads to the function returning `True` incorrectly even when the DataFrames are not equal based on block values.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of the blocks in the comparison function. Instead of simply sorting the blocks, we should compare the blocks by iterating over them sequentially. Additionally, we should ensure that the block values are compared based on the order of the blocks in the DataFrame.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version above now iterates over the blocks sequentially, ensuring that the comparison accounts for the order of the blocks in the DataFrames. This approach should fix the bug and align with the expected behavior of the `equals` function.
