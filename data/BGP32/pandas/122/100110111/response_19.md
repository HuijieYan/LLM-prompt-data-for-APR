### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in the columns, thus expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the test failed because `assert True is False` due to an issue with the comparison in the `equals` function.
4. The current implementation of `equals` uses the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. There seems to be an issue with sorting that leads to incorrect comparisons.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation of the `equals` method does not handle block comparisons correctly. The issue arises when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect comparisons and erroneous `True` returns in cases where the blocks are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparisons are done correctly without incorrectly returning `True` for unequal blocks. This can be achieved by revising the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.iget(0))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted and compared based on the type name and the first element's value, addressing the issue with incorrect comparisons and ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result.
