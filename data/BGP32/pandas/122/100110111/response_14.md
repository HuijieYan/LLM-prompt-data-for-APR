### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects along with their axes and blocks.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values to check the equality using the `equals` function. The test expects the `equals` function to return `False` because the data in the two data frames is not the same.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.
4. The expected input/output values provided show the correct values and types that the variables should hold during the test case execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the function is comparing blocks based on their order and locations instead of actual content. This causes the function to return `True` even if the data in the data frames is different, as the check is based on block locations rather than content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. Sorting the blocks based on their content before comparison can ensure that the function correctly evaluates the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content using `block.get_values()` in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data values rather than block locations. This adjustment should fix the bug and make the function correctly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.
