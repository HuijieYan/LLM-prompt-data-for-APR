The bug in the `equals` function causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical block values but different locations. This issue arises due to the sorting logic in the function based on block attributes. To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to take into account the block values rather than just block properties.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block values and compare them directly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version considers the actual block values during sorting, ensuring that DataFrames with the same values but different locations are not considered equal. The function will now pass the failing test case provided.
