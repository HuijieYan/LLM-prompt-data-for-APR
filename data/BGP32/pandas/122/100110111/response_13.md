### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the buggy code is supposed to compare two BlockManagers for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with the same columns but different values and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the `equals` function returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The expected input/output values indicate the expected values of variables at different stages of the function execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting is not accounting for the order of objects within the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the equality of blocks based on their positions, not just the `dtype.name`. The sorting should consider both `dtype.name` and block values. Thus, updating the `canonicalize` function would address the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_single_block.item())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the corrected function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the function should now properly handle DataFrame comparison based on block values.
