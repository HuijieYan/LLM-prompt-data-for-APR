### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file from the `pandas` library is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames with different values for columns `a` and `b`, expecting the `equals` function to return False.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the function returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The expected input values for the failing test are two DataFrames with different values for columns `a` and `b`, expecting the `equals` function to return False.
5. The GitHub issue reports the bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True for cases with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. Since the blocks are being sorted based on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`, this can lead to incorrect comparison results for identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a more robust approach for comparing the blocks is needed. Instead of using the combination of type name and `mgr_locs`, a direct comparison of the blocks based on their values should be performed. Additionally, the function should skip the sorting step for blocks to prevent incorrect results due to block locations.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison of blocks is done directly without sorting based on type name and `mgr_locs`, preventing the incorrect return of `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
