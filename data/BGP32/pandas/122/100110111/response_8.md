### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is checking the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the `equals` method of `DataFrame` objects with different data.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, returning `assert True is False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is not returning the expected output.
4. The expected input/output values provided show the structure of the `BlockManager` objects and their components involved in the equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class compares the blocks using their metadata like dtype and mgr_locs, but it does not take into account the actual values of the blocks. As a result, two `BlockManager` objects with different data but similar metadata are considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the actual data values in addition to the metadata of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This will ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their metadata.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for sb, ob in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if sb.shape != ob.shape or sb.index.equals(ob.index):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(sb.values, ob.values):
            return False

    return True
```

With the corrected version above, the comparison now considers not only the metadata of the blocks but also their actual data values, ensuring that different data within blocks will result in the `equals` method returning `False`.
