### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them and comparing their blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal, expecting a `False` result.
2. The error seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the two BlockManager objects.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the comparison of DataFrames with different values correctly. The failing test shows that even with different values, the function returns `True` instead of `False`. This is due to how the `canonicalize` function handles the sorting and comparison of blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly sorts and compares the blocks, taking into consideration the values and not just the dtype names and locations.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now correctly compares the values of the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
