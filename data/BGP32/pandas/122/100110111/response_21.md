### Bug Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function is expected to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block order. However, the buggy implementation fails due to an issue in comparing the actual blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns 'a' and 'b' having values ('1','s') and ('2','d') respectively in `df1`, and ('s','d') and ('1','2') respectively in `df2`. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`.

The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with `assert True is False`. This indicates that the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` even though `df1` and `df2` are not equal as expected.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `equals` function compares the axes of `self` and `other` first. If the lengths are different, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct.
2. Then, it should compare each pair of axes elements using the `equals` method. This part seems correct.
3. The internal block comparison is done by creating a canonical representation of blocks in terms of type name and locations. Sorting and comparing these lists should give the correct result.

The bug likely arises when comparing the actual block data since the two dataframes have different values in their blocks. The faulty implementation of block comparison leads to the incorrect result where `df1` and `df2` are considered equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the block comparison between `self` and `other` is accurate. This can be achieved by comparing the block data (values) directly within each block. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the blocks themselves within the sorted lists, the corrected function should accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` objects contain the same data. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
