### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function occurs due to the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the test expects the DataFrames to be not equal, but the comparison incorrectly evaluates to `True`.

The buggy function compares the DataFrames block by block, iterating through the blocks, and sorting them based on their dtype and position. The issue arises from the comparison logic where the ordering of blocks is not handled correctly.

### Bug Identification:
The bug can be identified by examining the comparison logic in the function. The error message, along with the runtime and expected values, provides insights into the incorrect behavior of the function.

The incorrect behavior stems from how the blocks are sorted and compared while checking for equality. The comparison logic should consider the ordering of the blocks based on their dtype and positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner across both DataFrames before performing the equality check. Sorting based on dtype and position should be done consistently for both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After sorting both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` consistently, the comparison of individual blocks should align properly, ensuring the correct evaluation of DataFrame equality. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
