### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic used for the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` instances.

1. When comparing the blocks, the function sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the block's data type name and `mgr_locs` attribute.
2. The bug is likely occurring because the sorting logic in `canonicalize` is incorrectly sorting the blocks, resulting in a failed comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done correctly based on the block's data type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Proposed Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version of the `equals` function corrects the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, ensuring that the comparison is done properly based on the block's data type name and `mgr_locs`.
