### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes length, individual axes, and blocks. It checks if the lengths of the axes are equal and then iterates over each block to compare them.
- The bug occurs because the comparison logic converts the blocks into a form that cannot be properly compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, ensure that the blocks are converted into a comparable form before comparing.
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the comparison correctly.
- Update the comparison logic to use the modified `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks, ensuring that the comparison results are correct.
