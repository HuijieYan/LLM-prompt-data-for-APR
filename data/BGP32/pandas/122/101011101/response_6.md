### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The function is not considering the case when the blocks are not equal in number. As a consequence, even if the axes are equal, the function incorrectly returns `True` if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` is different.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` is the same before comparing individual blocks. If the numbers are different, we should return `False`. 

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By adding the check for the length of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing individual blocks, the corrected function will now properly handle cases where the number of blocks is different, fixing the bug.
