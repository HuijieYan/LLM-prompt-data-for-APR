### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function `equals` arises from sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function extracts the block's dtype name and the locations as a list, but the comparison is not correctly handling the case where the block data differs only in the dtype name (as in the failing test case). This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two different blocks based on dtype name only.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function. Instead of simply comparing the dtype name and locations list, we should compare the data values within the blocks to ensure their equality. If any difference is found, we should return `False`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `block.values` in addition to the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`, we ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual data values. This correction should resolve the issue in the failing test case.
