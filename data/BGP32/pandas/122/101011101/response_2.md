### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs because the comparison of blocks is not being handled correctly. The function compares two BlockManager instances using their `axes` and `blocks`. However, the comparison of blocks involves sorting the blocks by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array`, which are not correctly implemented.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. We should sort the blocks by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` before comparing them. This will ensure a consistent and accurate comparison between the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # This function needs to be corrected
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected function should now correctly compare two BlockManager instances and pass the failing test.
