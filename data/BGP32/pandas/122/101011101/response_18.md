The issue in the buggy function is related to the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, revealing that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from how the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is implemented. In the provided implementation, the method compares the blocks in the DataFrames `self` and `other`, sorted based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the comparison does not take into account the actual data within the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the actual data within the blocks rather than solely relying on their dtype and locations. We should ensure that the comparison of the blocks includes checking the data stored within each block, rather than just their descriptions.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # other internal methods here...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        for b1, b2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not b1.equals(b2):
                return False
        
        return True
```

After implementing this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison will correctly verify the equality of the blocks within the DataFrames, accounting for the actual data. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass as expected.
