### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises when comparing the blocks within the BlockManager instances. The bug causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` when the blocks are not equal.

#### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method of each block. However, before comparison, the function sorts the blocks based on a `canonicalize` function that generates a tuple of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. The bug occurs because the method to generate the canonical tuple does not consider the actual data in the blocks, which causes incorrect sorting.
3. Since the block data is not considered in the sorting, even when the blocks themselves are different, they might end up in the same order after sorting, leading to a false equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to sort the blocks based on both block values and the information generated by `canonicalize`. This will ensure that blocks with the same characteristics but different data are not considered equal. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values as well.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances and return `False` when the blocks are different, resolving the bug.
