### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing two DataFrame objects where the columns are in different orders. The function is wrongly implemented to compare the blocks in a fixed order without considering the column order. This causes the function to fail in cases where the column order differs between `self` and `other`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the columns in addition to the block contents. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the column order. This way, we ensure that blocks are compared correctly regardless of the column order in the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (list(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the blocks based on the column order, we ensure that the function handles cases where columns are in different orders correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
