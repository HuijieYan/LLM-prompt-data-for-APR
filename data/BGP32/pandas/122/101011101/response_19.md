### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` where the columns are swapped. The function first compares the axes of both DataFrames, and since the axes are the same, it proceeds to compare the blocks within each DataFrame. However, the comparison of blocks is done without considering the order of columns, leading to a mismatch when the columns are not in the same order between the two DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the column order when comparing blocks between the two DataFrames. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a combination of column names and other characteristics to ensure that the comparison takes into account the relative positions of columns.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort the blocks based on column name and other characteristics
        return (
            str(block.mgr_locs),  # use mgr_locs to differentiate blocks
            str(block.dtype),      # consider dtype for further distinction
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this corrected version, the function will properly compare the blocks based on the column order, leading to accurate DataFrame equality comparison even when the columns are in a different position.
