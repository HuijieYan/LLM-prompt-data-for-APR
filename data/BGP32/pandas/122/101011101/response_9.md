### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided equals function arises due to the incorrect comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have different values in corresponding cells. The bug triggers the assertion error because the function mistakenly returns True, indicating that `df1` equals `df2` when they are not equal.

1. On line 27 of the buggy function, there is a sorting operation on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting operation aims to handle unconsolidated blocks that might have different orderings.
   
2. The cause of the bug is the mistaken assumption that sorting the blocks based on dtype and location is sufficient to determine equality between DataFrames. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have corresponding columns 'a' and 'b' with different data types and values. When sorted based on dtype and location, the function incorrectly concludes that the DataFrames are equal, leading to the failing assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the equals function, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider the actual values stored in the blocks rather than just their dtype and location. By comparing the block values instead of their characteristics, we can accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the equals function with updated logic to compare the values stored in the blocks:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # comparing block values instead of characteristics
    return all(
        block.values.content_equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values stored in the blocks using the `content_equals` method, the corrected function accurately checks if two DataFrames are equal based on their actual content.
