The bug in the provided function occurs due to incorrectly comparing the DataFrame blocks. The function `equals` is used to compare if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.

The bug arises when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function should return a tuple of the block's type name and manager locations. However, the `.as_array.tolist()` method is incorrectly used after `mgr_locs`, which leads to the wrong comparison of blocks.

To fix this bug, remove the `.as_array.tolist()` part from the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing `.as_array.tolist()`, now the function correctly compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This correction should resolve the failing test case and fulfill the expected input/output values.
