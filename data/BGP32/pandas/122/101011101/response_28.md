### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames where the columns have different types. The `equals` method in pandas compares the two DataFrames element-wise, leading to a mismatch when comparing integers to strings.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. Within the `canonicalize` function, the sorting is based on the combination of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which does not handle cases where columns have different types correctly.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we consider the data type of each block. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data types of the blocks as part of the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
        
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `block.values` instead of `block.mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function, we can compare the actual data values of each block while considering their types. This correction will ensure that the comparison handles cases where columns have different data types correctly.
