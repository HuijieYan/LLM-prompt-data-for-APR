### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a `canonicalize` function that uses the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes to define the sorting order. However, when comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, the inner blocks are swapped between `self` and `other`, causing the `all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))` check to fail even though the dataframes should be considered equal. 

The `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes do not directly correlate with the actual contents of the data blocks, leading to this incorrect comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic to ensure that we are comparing the actual data within the blocks, rather than relying on attributes that may not accurately represent the block content. We should consider comparing the block content itself instead of relying on secondary attributes. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we sort `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the raw block values by converting them to bytes using `block.values.tobytes()`. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, rather than arbitrary attributes that may not represent the block content accurately. This fix should address the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.
