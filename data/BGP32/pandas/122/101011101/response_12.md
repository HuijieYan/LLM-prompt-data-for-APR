### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different column types. The `df1` has columns of type int64 and object, while `df2` has the columns swapped. Hence, the `equals` function fails to correctly identify the dataframes as unequal based on the column order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the order of the columns as relevant in the comparison. We can sort the columns before comparing to ensure that the dataframes are correctly identified as unequal based on their column order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Sort columns to handle column order differences
    self_columns = [col for col in self_axes[0]]
    other_columns = [col for col in other_axes[0]]
    if sorted(self_columns) != sorted(other_columns):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the columns before comparison in the corrected version, we can ensure that dataframes with differing column orders are correctly identified as unequal by the `equals` function. This correction should resolve the failing test case.
