### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from not correctly comparing the content of two DataFrames by their column values. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` which can lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks themselves are not consolidated properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing the DataFrames based on their column values and not just sorting their blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the values in the corresponding columns directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_columns = self.items.tolist()
    other_columns = other.items.tolist()

    if self_columns != other_columns:
        return False

    for col in self_columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
``` 

The corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the values of corresponding columns in `self` and `other` DataFrames. It checks if the list of columns is the same and then iterates over each column to compare their contents using the `equals` method for Series.
