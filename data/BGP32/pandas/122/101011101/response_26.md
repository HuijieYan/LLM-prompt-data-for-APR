### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The function compares two BlockManager instances for equality, primarily by comparing their axes and blocks.

#### Issues:
1. The comparison of axes might fail when the order of axes is different between `self` and `other`.
2. The sorting of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations can lead to incorrect comparison if the order is different between `self` and `other`.
3. If the length of `self.blocks` is not equal to the length of `other.blocks`, the comparison fails.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by the sorting of blocks without considering the order of blocks in `self` and `other`. Additionally, the comparison of axes might fail due to their order.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the order of axes does not matter when comparing.
2. Sort the blocks in a way that it considers the order within `self` and `other`.
3. Verify the length of blocks before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = sorted(self.axes), sorted(other.axes)
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the axes and blocks consistently and comparing based on a canonical form that considers the order within self and other, we can ensure the correct comparison of two BlockManager instances.
