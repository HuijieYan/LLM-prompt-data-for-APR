### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, where the columns are of different types. The buggy function `equals` fails to handle this case correctly because it assumes that each block has the same type in both DataFrames. This assumption leads to a comparison failure and incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when blocks have different types during the comparison. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a tuple of both the block type name and the block values to ensure a comprehensive comparison that considers the block's type and content.

### Corrected Version of the Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block type name and the block values when sorting the blocks, we ensure a more accurate comparison. Now, the corrected function will correctly handle the case of different types in the DataFrame columns and provide an accurate evaluation of equality.
