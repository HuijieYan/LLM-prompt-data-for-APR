The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in pandas. The error occurs when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The expected behavior is that the two DataFrames are not equal, however, the test fails.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. The comparison logic assumes that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain blocks in a specific order, which may not hold true causing the test to fail. Sorting the block lists based on certain criteria may not be sufficient for determining equality.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of directly sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, it's better to iterate over the blocks and compare them individually. This ensures a more accurate comparison between the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for block_name in self.blocks.keys():
            if block_name not in other.blocks:
                return False
            if not self.blocks[block_name].equals(other.blocks[block_name]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version compares each block individually for equality, ensuring more robust behavior in comparing DataFrames.
