The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of DataFrame blocks based on block type (`dtype.name`) and locations (`mgr_locs`). This comparison logic can result in incorrect results when the order of blocks between two DataFrames is swapped, leading to a false positive in the equality check.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure consistent and correct DataFrame block matching.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- We are now sorting the blocks based on the block type name and block locations to ensure consistent ordering for comparison.
- We are using a lambda function within the `sorted` function to extract the block type name and locations for sorting.

This correction ensures that the comparison between DataFrame blocks is done more reliably, preventing false positives in the equality check.
