### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of block type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute converted to a list, but the comparison is done using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which results in a mismatch between the expected and actual values. This inconsistency leads to the failing test and the subsequent assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `canonicalize` function matches the expected structure. By directly converting `mgr_locs` to a list in the `canonicalize` function and comparing these lists during sorting, we can align the expected and actual values for sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now directly converts `mgr_locs` to a list, aligning it with the expected values and ensuring the correct sorting and comparison in the `equals` function. This should resolve the failing test and prevent the assertion error.
