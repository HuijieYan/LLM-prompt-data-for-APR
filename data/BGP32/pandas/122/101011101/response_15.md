### Bug explanation

The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using a sorting key generated by the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple based on the block's data type name and manager locations. However, when comparing the blocks in the sorted lists, it solely relies on the `equals` method, which does not consider the data type name and manager locations extracted in `canonicalize`.

### Bug fix strategy

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison of blocks not only relies on the `equals` method but also considers the criteria used in `canonicalize` for sorting. One solution is to update the comparison logic to compare the data type name and manager locations along with calling the `equals` method.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks based on data type and manager locations
    return all(
        block_dtype == oblock_dtype and block_mgr_locs == oblock_mgr_locs and block.equals(oblock)
        for (block, block_dtype, block_mgr_locs), (oblock, oblock_dtype, oblock_mgr_locs)
        in zip([(block, *canonicalize(block)) for block in self_blocks],
               [(oblock, *canonicalize(oblock)) for oblock in other_blocks])
    )
```

This corrected version compares the data type and manager locations along with using the `equals` method to ensure a proper comparison of blocks.
