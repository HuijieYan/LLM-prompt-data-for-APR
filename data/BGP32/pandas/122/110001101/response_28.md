### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class when comparing two instances. The bug arises because the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two instances.

1. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are not equal. If they are not, it returns `False`, indicating that the instances are different.
2. Then, the function proceeds to sort and canonicalize the blocks of the two instances based on their dtype name and manager locations.
3. However, during this canonicalization process, the function fails to correctly compare the blocks between the two instances. This leads to incorrect determination of the equality between the two instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks of the two instances. We can achieve this by comparing each block from `self` with the corresponding block from `other` and checking for equality.

Additionally, we should address the comparison logic within the lambda function used in the `all` method to compare the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we compare each block from `self` with the corresponding block from `other` using the `block_equals` function. We also ensure that the lambda function used in the `all` method correctly compares the blocks.
