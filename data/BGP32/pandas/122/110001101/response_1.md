### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug occurs in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison logic sorts the blocks based on a function `canonicalize`, which extracts information about the block dtype and mgr_locs. However, the `canonicalize` function is using the `as_array.tolist()` method, which in the provided context is not a valid operation and causes a runtime error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract information about the blocks in a way that supports the comparison operation. We need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is properly handled to avoid any errors.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### With this change, the bug in the function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class should be fixed, allowing it to properly compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
