The bug in the function `equals` stems from the way blocks are being compared in the `canonicalize` function. The bug arises because the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly within the `canonicalize` function, which leads to an AttributeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to access `mgr_locs` correctly. Additionally, we should handle cases where blocks have different attributes by implementing a more robust comparison method.


```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values.dtype), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the block's `values` attribute and compare them based on dtype and values. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately.
