### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, assuming it will provide a consistent ordering. However, the comparison fails because the dtype name and mgr_locs are not directly comparable between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic where the blocks are sorted. Instead of directly comparing the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should first retrieve the relevant characteristics from the blocks that can be compared. This may involve identifying a unique representation for each block that can be used for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_comparison_key(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.iget(0))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_comparison_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_comparison_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing a `get_comparison_key` function to extract comparable characteristics from the blocks, we ensure that the comparison is done on meaningful attributes. This corrected version should resolve the bug and provide the expected output.
