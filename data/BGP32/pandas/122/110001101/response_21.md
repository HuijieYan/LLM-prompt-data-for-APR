### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the blocks in two `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the block's `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly, leading to a misinterpretation of the block's content during comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is accessed correctly before comparing them in the `equals` function. This can be achieved by directly using the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block without converting it to a list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the corrected `canonicalize` function to use `mgr_locs.as_array` correctly, we address the bug in block comparison and ensure the function works as expected.
