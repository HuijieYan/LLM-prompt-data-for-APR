The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way blocks are sorted before comparison. The current sorting mechanism is using a tuple of block type and `mgr_locs`, which leads to incorrect comparisons when the blocks have different types or `mgr_locs`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block type and the index of the block within the blocks list. This ensures that even unconsolidated blocks with the same type are distinguished correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block index
        def canonicalize(block, idx):
            return (idx, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], self.blocks.index(x)))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], other.blocks.index(x)))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are sorted based on both their type, index, and `mgr_locs`, enabling accurate comparisons between `BlockManager` instances. It addresses the issue of incorrectly comparing blocks with different types or layouts.
