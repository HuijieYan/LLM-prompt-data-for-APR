### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how the `canonicalize` function is sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The sorting key used in `canonicalize` returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and its manager locations, but it fails to consider unconsolidated blocks where the order of typeName and manager locations may change, leading to incorrect comparison results. This can make the function return `False` even if the blocks are actually equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider unconsolidated blocks correctly to produce a stable sorting key. This can involve considering additional attributes that uniquely identify each block, ensuring consistent ordering for comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.is_consolidated:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.blocks_shape, block._is_single_block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function modifies the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks, ensuring a consistent and stable ordering mechanism for comparing blocks. This fix should address the bug and ensure accurate comparisons between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
