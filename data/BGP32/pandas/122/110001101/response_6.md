The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on the ordering of blocks by their type name and `mgr_locs`, but the way the `canonicalize` function is implemented is causing the bug.

The `canonicalize` function is supposed to return a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the incorrect usage of `.as_array.tolist()` is causing the tuples to be wrongly formed. This incorrect formation leads to false mismatches between blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to properly retrieve the `mgr_locs` and form the tuples correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the tuples formed in the `canonicalize` function are based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` without any incorrect conversions.
