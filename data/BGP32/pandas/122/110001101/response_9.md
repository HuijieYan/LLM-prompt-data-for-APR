The bug in the provided `equals` function arises due to comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances without considering the order of the blocks. The blocks need to be sorted before comparing for equality to ensure that the comparison is valid regardless of the order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them for equality. This ensures that the comparison is consistent regardless of the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

This correction should address the bug and allow the `equals` function to correctly determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their blocks.
