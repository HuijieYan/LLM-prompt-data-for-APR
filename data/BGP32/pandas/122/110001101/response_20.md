### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The function sorts the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs` to compare them, but the comparison is flawed as it does not correctly compare the blocks. The issue lies in the sorting of blocks based on insufficient criteria for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to improve the comparison of blocks by implementing a more appropriate sorting mechanism that ensures the correct comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version improves the sorting mechanism by comparing blocks' types and the entire block object itself, ensuring a more reliable comparison between blocks and accurately assessing the equality between `self` and `other` BlockManager instances.
