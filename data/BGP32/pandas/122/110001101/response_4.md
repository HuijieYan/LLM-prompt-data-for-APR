The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting mechanism used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug occurs due to the different block orders between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's shape information in addition to the block's data type and manager locations. This will help in comparing blocks more accurately based on their content.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, shape, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, we enhance the block comparison to consider both data type, shape, and manager locations, resulting in a more accurate equality comparison between blocks.
