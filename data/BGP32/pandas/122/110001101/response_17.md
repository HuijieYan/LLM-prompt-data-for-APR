### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The comparison does not account for the order of blocks within the managers, which results in incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` considers the order of the blocks within the managers. Sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparison can help address this issue.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected version of the `equals` function includes sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManagers based on a canonical representation before comparison to ensure proper equality checks.
