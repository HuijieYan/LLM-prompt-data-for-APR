The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The comparison should take into account the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks in addition to the dtype name.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function in the original code does not properly consider the `mgr_locs` attribute when sorting the blocks. This leads to incorrect comparisons, especially between blocks of the same dtype but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting key. This will ensure that blocks with the same dtype but different locations are correctly distinguished.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs`, the corrected function should now properly compare blocks based on dtype and location, resolving the bug.
