The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison between the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by type and manager locations, but the issue lies in the extraction of manager locations.

The `canonicalize` function incorrectly handles extracting the manager locations as an array and then converting it to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This leads to incorrect comparison results due to the improper transformation of manager locations.

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle extracting the manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or (self_axes != other_axes).any():
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version correctly compares the blocks by type and manager locations, ensuring a proper comparison result.
