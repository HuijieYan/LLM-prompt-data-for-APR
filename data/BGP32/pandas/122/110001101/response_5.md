### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison logic is incorrect as it fails to consider the order of blocks and simply sorts them by a canonicalized version that does not guarantee correct matching of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly based on their actual content rather than just sorting them. We should compare the blocks directly rather than relying on sorting.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

By directly comparing each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`, we ensure a correct comparison without relying on sorting.
