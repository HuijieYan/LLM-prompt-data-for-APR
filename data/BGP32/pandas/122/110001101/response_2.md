### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on a custom key function `canonicalize`, which combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. 

The issue occurs because `mgr_locs` is accessed using `.as_array.tolist()`, which returns a list of indices rather than the `BlockPlacement` object itself. This results in incorrect canonicalization and subsequently incorrect comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `canonicalize` properly extracts the information required for sorting the blocks. We should directly access the `mgr_locs` attributes from the block object to create the tuple for sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version accesses `mgr_locs` directly from the block object and uses the type name of the block for canonicalization, fixing the bug in the comparison process.
