### Bug explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a comparison inconsistency in the way the blocks are sorted and compared. The function attempts to compare two `BlockManager` objects by first checking the equality of their axes, consolidating the objects, and then comparing their blocks. The sorting of the blocks is done based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` values. However, in the comparison of the blocks, it is comparing the blocks' equal method directly, which might lead to incorrect results.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic between blocks is consistent with the sorting logic. Instead of directly comparing the blocks using their `equals` method, we should use a comparison method that aligns with the sorting logic based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks based on canonicalized values
    return all(
        block.dtype == oblock.dtype and block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` values directly in the `equals` function, we ensure that the comparison aligns with the sorting logic based on the canonicalized values, ultimately fixing the bug.
