### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes, blocks, and block contents are equal between the two instances. However, the bug arises due to the incorrect sorting of blocks before comparison. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, but the comparison logic does not consider the block ordering correctly, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the sorting of blocks within the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them. However, the comparison of blocks is faulty as it does not account for the correct ordering of blocks between `self` and `other`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function considers the order of blocks in both `self` and `other`. We can accomplish this by directly comparing corresponding blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances based on their original ordering.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Directly compare corresponding blocks preserving order
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing blocks in order, we ensure an accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should address the bug and allow for correct comparisons between the instances.
