The bug in the `equals` function arises when trying to compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The issue lies in how the blocks are being canonicalized before comparison. The current implementation does not handle the case where the blocks are sorted based on dtype names and `mgr_locs`, which could lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle block comparison based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define a new canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.key)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function properly handles the sorting based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring accurate comparisons between the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected output values.
