## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing blocks based on their dtype names and manager locations. This leads to false positives when blocks have the same content but in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on dtype names and manager locations, compare them directly based on their content.
2. Update the comparison logic to check if the blocks have the same content rather than relying on dtype names and manager locations.
3. Ensure that the comparison properly checks the equality of the blocks themselves.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on their content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly based on their content, the corrected version of the `equals` function will accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
