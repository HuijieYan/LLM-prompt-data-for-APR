The cause of the bug in the `equals` method lies in the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises when comparing the block order based on a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` (location of the block) due to unconsolidated blocks resulting in different orderings. As a result, the comparison fails even when the blocks are identical.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison based on the block content rather than their specific locations within the `BlockManager`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # compare blocks one by one
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block_equals = self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i])
        if not block_equals:
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through the blocks in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances and compare each block's content using the `equals` method provided for the blocks. This ensures that we are comparing the actual data within the blocks instead of their locations, fixing the bug that caused the `equals` function to give incorrect results.

By replacing the original `equals` function with this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
