## Bug Analysis:

1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking the axes and blocks of each instance.

2. The bug arises from the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The method fails to correctly compare blocks that are identical but located in different positions.

3. The bug causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to assert that two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not equal, but the buggy `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` due to the insufficient handling of block comparisons.

4. To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just the reference to the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing block content directly instead of relying on block reference and ordering.

## Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Existing class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected method:
1. `canonicalize` function is removed and replaced with sorting based on string representation of blocks.
2. Blocks are sorted before comparison based on their string representation to ensure that identical blocks are correctly compared.

This fix addresses the issue where identical blocks in different locations were not being correctly compared, leading to incorrect equality comparison results.
