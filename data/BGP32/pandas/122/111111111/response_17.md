To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to consider the issue raised in the GitHub problem description. The problem arises when the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

Based on the provided code and runtime values, the bug originates from the sorting of blocks using the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. The issue is with the comparison of the mgr_locs of the blocks. Instead of comparing `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we should compare the actual `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, it should now correctly handle comparisons between identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result `False` in such cases.
