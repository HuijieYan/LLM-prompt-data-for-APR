Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` if the blocks have identical contents but different locations.

To fix this bug, we can implement a modification in the `canonicalize` function that correctly handles the comparison of blocks by including their content as well as their respective locations. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order including content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.equals_values(other), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this correction, the `canonicalize` function now includes the comparison of block values and their locations. This modification ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as different, leading to the desired behavior in the `equals` function.

Please implement this corrected version in the `BlockManager` class to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
