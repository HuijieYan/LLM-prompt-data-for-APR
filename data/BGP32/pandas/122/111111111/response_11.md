The bug in the `equals` function seems to stem from the way blocks are being compared. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations, but the comparison may fail if the locations are different even though the data is the same.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to consider the data within the blocks rather than just the locations. This way, blocks with the same data but different locations will still be considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated function directly compares the data within the blocks along with their type name and locations. This should ensure that blocks with the same data content are considered equal, fixing the bug that caused the `equals` function to wrongly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
