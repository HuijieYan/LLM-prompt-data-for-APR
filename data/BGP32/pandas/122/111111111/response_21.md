The bug in the provided `equals` function is due to the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. Even if the blocks have identical content, the comparison fails when the blocks have different memory locations.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison logic to compare the content of the blocks instead of their memory locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock, compare_exact=True) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- We first check if the lengths of the axes are different, or if any of the axes are not equal. If so, we return False.
- We then consolidate the internal data structures of both `self` and `other`.
- Next, we compare the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are different, we return False.
- We define a new `canonicalize` function that considers both the block values and the block locations for comparison.
- We sort the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function.
- Finally, we compare the sorted blocks using `equals` method with `compare_exact=True` to examine the content of the blocks.

With this corrected logic, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the contents of `self` and `other` blocks, passing the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue mentioned.
