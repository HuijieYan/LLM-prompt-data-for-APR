Based on the analysis provided, the issue in the function stems from the comparison of blocks that have the same content but different locations. Since the comparison is based on the order of these blocks, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. To fix this issue, a strategy is to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values if isinstance(block, Block) else block

    self_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks]

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to extract the values from the blocks if they are of type `Block`. Then, the comparison is done based on these values. This approach ensures that the content of the blocks is compared rather than their order, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

By using this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
