The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations but with identical content. The function incorrectly returns `True` in such cases instead of `False`. To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the content of blocks rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sorting blocks and comparing their content rather than their locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the content of blocks in different locations and return the expected result.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub, where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` for DataFrame instances with identical blocks but different locations.
