### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the issue arises when comparing the blocks of different DataFrames. The problem occurs due to the order of sorting the blocks during comparison in the `equals` function. Since the block order is dependent on both the type name and the `mgr_locs` of each block, if the same blocks are arranged differently, the comparison can result in a false positive indicating that the DataFrames are equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the block comparison should be modified in a way that accurately reflects the equality of blocks in DataFrames, irrespective of their order. One way to ensure this is to compare the blocks by their content directly rather than relying on a specific order determined by `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_content = {block: block.values for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_content = {block: block.values for block in other.blocks}

    return self_block_content == other_block_content
``` 

By directly comparing the content of the blocks in the corrected version, we can ensure the equality check is accurate and does not rely on a specific order. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function work as expected.
