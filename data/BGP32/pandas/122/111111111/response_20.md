The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to comparing blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises when blocks are identical but their locations are different, leading to a false positive comparison result. This is due to the current approach of sorting and comparing blocks with potentially different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. We can achieve this by comparing blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary for self blocks
    self_blocks_dict = {block._data.items: block for block in self.blocks}

    # Compare each block in other.blocks with corresponding block in self blocks
    for other_block in other.blocks:
        if other_block._data.items not in self_blocks_dict:
            return False
        # Compare block content instead of locations
        self_block = self_blocks_dict[other_block._data.items]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their content rather than their locations. This change ensures that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their locations within the `BlockManager`. After applying this fix, the failing test should pass as expected.
