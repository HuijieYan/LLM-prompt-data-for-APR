## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks within two instances of the class `self` and `other`. It checks if the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` are equal, then iterates over the axes to compare each pair.
2. The bug seems to be occurring in the block comparison logic after consolidating the blocks. It checks the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and then proceeds with sorting and comparing the blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns `a` and `b` swapped. It asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails with an assertion error.
4. The error message indicates that it expected `True` to be `False`, suggesting that the internal block comparison logic is flawed.
5. The variables being compared include axes, blocks, and block properties like dtype and mgr_locs.
6. The expected behavior is for the `equals` method to compare the blocks appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic for blocks after consolidation. We need to ensure that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their existence.
2. We should focus on comparing the actual content within the blocks while also considering the correct block order for comparison.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version focuses on properly comparing the values within the blocks during the block sorting and comparison process. This should address the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
