### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the issue arises when comparing the blocks by sorting them based on their data types and memory locations. This can lead to incorrect equality results, as the comparison should focus on the actual data within the blocks rather than their properties.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison process in the `equals` function to focus on comparing the actual data within the blocks rather than sorting them based on data types and memory locations. This ensures that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks, which is the intended behavior for comparing `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly by iterating over them and checking for equality. This way, the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their attributes. This approach ensures that the equality check reflects the intended behavior of comparing `BlockManager` instances.
