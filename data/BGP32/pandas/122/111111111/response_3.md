The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to comparing DataFrame blocks in different order when checking for equality.

### Error Explanation:
1. The `equals` function compares blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are of equal length, then ensures that the axes are equal.
   
2. After consolidating the instances in-place (which should not change the order of blocks), it compares the number of blocks. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.

3. The bug arises in the next step where the blocks are sorted based on a canonicalization function (`canonicalize`) that uses a combination of the block's data type name and the manager locations. This sorting causes the blocks to be compared in a different order, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in the correct order without being sorted. We can achieve this by modifying the comparison logic to iterate over the blocks in their original order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

After making this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances without sorting them, ensuring that equality is evaluated accurately. This should fix the failing test case and address the GitHub issue related to the bug.
