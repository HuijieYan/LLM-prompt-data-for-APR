## Bug Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be located in the comparison of blocks where the order matters. The sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is causing the discrepancy in comparing the blocks.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The comparison is performed by sorting the blocks of the two instances based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting mechanism can cause identical blocks with different locations to be treated as non-equal.
   - The test case provided is comparing two DataFrames with the same content but in a different order. The current sorting logic causes the comparison to fail.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be done based on actual data equality rather than sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.array_hash())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.array_hash())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts blocks based on a new method `array_hash` which should ensure that identical blocks are considered equal. This change will allow the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances based on the actual contents of the blocks rather than just their ordering.
