## Correction:

The issue lies in the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManagers. The blocks are being sorted based on block dtype name and locations, but the comparison should be more granular, checking each element within the blocks for equality.

To fix this bug, the comparison should loop through the blocks and compare the content of each block instead of just checking if the blocks themselves are equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating through the blocks and comparing them element-wise, we ensure a more accurate comparison between the two BlockManagers. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
