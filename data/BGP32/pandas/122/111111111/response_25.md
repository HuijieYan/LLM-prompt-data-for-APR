The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks but different block locations. The function should return `False` in such cases according to the expected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`).
- If the axes are of different lengths, the function correctly returns `False`.
- However, the comparison of blocks is done after sorting the blocks based on the data type name and manager locations. This sorting does not handle the case where identical blocks are in different locations, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic for blocks. Instead of only sorting the blocks based on data type name and manager locations, we should compare the blocks directly to ensure they are identical.

### Updated Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this modification, the `equals` function will directly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects to determine equality, resolving the issue.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now return `False` as expected when comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks but different block locations. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
