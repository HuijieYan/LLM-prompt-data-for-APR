The bug in the `equals` function is causing the DataFrame objects to be considered equal when they have identical blocks but with different locations, leading to the test case failure.

### Bug Description:
The bug arises because the `equals` function does not handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and locations, assuming that this order must be preserved. However, since the sort operation can change the order of identical blocks with different locations, it incorrectly returns True for cases where the blocks are the same but in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on their dtype name and locations, we should compare the blocks directly without changing their order. This way, we can correctly identify cases where the blocks are the same but in different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without sorting based on dtype name and locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where identical blocks are in different locations and return the expected results for the failing test.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
