The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison logic of blocks within the function. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances, even if their underlying blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances using their memory locations, leading to incorrect results when identical blocks are at different memory locations.
2. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function generates a key based on the block's data type name and location, causing the comparison to fail for blocks with the same data but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual block data within the `BlockManager` instances instead of relying on memory locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def get_blocks_data(blocks):
        return [block.values for block in blocks]
    
    self_blocks_data = get_blocks_data(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_data = get_blocks_data(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, other_block_data) 
        for block_data, other_block_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances using `np.array_equal` to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content rather than memory locations. Now, the function should correctly return `False` when comparing instances with identical blocks at different locations, resolving the bug.
