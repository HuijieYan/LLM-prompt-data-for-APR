### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises because the comparison between blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists doesn't consider the possibility of unconsolidated blocks like `Categorical` that might have different locations. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider unconsolidated blocks. We can update the `canonicalize` function to include information about the block's type and locations. This way, the comparison between blocks will correctly account for unconsolidated blocks with similar content but different locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering block dtype, content, and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function can now properly compare blocks with similar content but different locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
