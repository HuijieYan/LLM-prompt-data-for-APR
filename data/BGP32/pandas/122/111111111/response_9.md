The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue is related to the comparison of blocks and the handling of block locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Block comparison logic.
2. Handling of block locations.
3. Sorting and canonicalizing blocks for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function not considering the block locations. If the blocks are identical but located differently, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider not only the contents of the blocks but also their locations. Canonicalize the blocks based on both data type and location before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.values.equals(oblock.values))
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by considering block locations and block values during comparison. It ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.
