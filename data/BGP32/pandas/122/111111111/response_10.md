## Correction of the Bug

### Identification of the Bug
The bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison is based on the blocks' order and content. However, the bug causes the function to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This issue is captured in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to correctly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. One way to achieve this is by comparing the actual values within the blocks instead of relying solely on sorting by a canonical form.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for idx, self_block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        other_block = other_blocks[idx]
        
        # Check block equality based on block values
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Validating the Fix

By updating the `equals` function with the suggested implementation, we ensure that the comparison now correctly checks for the equality of blocks based on their actual content instead of their locations.

This fix will address the specific issue described in the GitHub bug report and allow the `equals` function to correctly compare DataFrame blocks with different locations but identical content.
