### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes the equality check between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) to return `True` incorrectly. The function compares the axes of the input DataFrames, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within the DataFrames. The bug arises when sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. If data blocks in different DataFrames have the same dtype names but different locations, the function incorrectly interprets them as equal. This leads to a false positive result in the equality check, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers both the dtype names and the manager locations. Sorting the blocks solely based on dtype names is incorrect since identically typed blocks with different locations can exist. By comparing both dtype names and manager locations, the function will correctly identify differences between blocks of the same type. The correct approach is to use a tuple consisting of the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block for canonicalization.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should correctly compare DataFrames and return `False` for the failing test case. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to DataFrame equality check with blocks in different locations.
