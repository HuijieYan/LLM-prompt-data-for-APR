The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison between blocks with the same data but different memory locations, causing the comparison to fail when it shouldn't.

Here's the analysis of the bug and the fix:

### Bug Analysis:
- **Bug Location:** `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
- **Cause of Bug:** The function fails to correctly compare blocks due to different memory locations.
- **Runtime Values:** The function fails because it compares blocks that have the same data but different memory locations.
- **Expected Values:** The comparison should ignore memory locations and focus on data comparison.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on the actual data instead of memory locations. This ensures that the comparison of blocks is performed correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on data, not memory locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing blocks based on their data rather than memory locations, the corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined in the analysis.
