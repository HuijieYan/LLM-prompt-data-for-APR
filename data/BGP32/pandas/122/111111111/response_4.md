## Correction

Based on the provided code and information, the issue seems to be with the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is currently incorrectly comparing blocks based on their locations which causes the test to fail.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to only compare the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    # Sort and compare the blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This updated version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their content before comparing them. This should ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data in the blocks rather than on their locations, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.

After making this change, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.

Feel free to test the corrected function with the provided test case to verify if the issue has been resolved.
