## Bug Fix

### Issue:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the block arrays without considering the array locations. This leads to incorrect `True` results even when the blocks have different locations.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to compare the block array values along with their locations. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if not all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        return False
    return True
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected code:
- We added a comparison between each block from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method for the `Block` class.
- By comparing the block arrays along with their locations, it ensures that identical blocks must have the same values at the same positions to be considered equal.
- The return value is set to `True` only if all block comparisons return `True`, indicating that all blocks in both `BlockManager` instances are equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the block arrays by considering both the data values and their locations, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.

Feel free to implement this fix in the `BlockManager` class to address the bug.
