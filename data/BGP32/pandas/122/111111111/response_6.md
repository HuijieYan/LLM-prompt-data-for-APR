The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case to fail. The function is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, expecting them to be not equal but incorrectly returning `True`. The key issue lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.

### Bug Analysis:
1. **Issue**: The function is comparing blocks from `self` and `other` based on their order in memory locations which may differ even if the blocks are conceptually identical.
   
2. **Cause**: The comparison logic heavily relies on the memory locations of the blocks which results in incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the comparison logic to ensure that the content of the blocks is checked for equality rather than their memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to canonicalize the block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check for equality based on the content of the blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare the content of the blocks and sorting the blocks based on this comparison, the corrected `equals` function will appropriately compare the two `BlockManager` instances.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
