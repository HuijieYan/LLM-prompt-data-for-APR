### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` checks if two DataFrames are not equal.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The issue is due to the sorting done on `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a custom key function that combines the block's type name and locations. This can result in blocks with identical data but different locations being considered unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which considers block type and locations. If two blocks have the same data but different locations, they are not considered equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare blocks based on their content data only, without considering the locations. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on content data alone.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        block_data.equals(oblock_data) for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

### Updated Explanation:
The updated `equals` function first extracts the content data from each block using the `get_values()` method, storing them in `self_blocks_data` and `other_blocks_data`. It then compares these content data to check for equality without considering block locations. This modification ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
