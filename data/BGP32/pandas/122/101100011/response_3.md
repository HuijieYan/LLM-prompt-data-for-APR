### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two objects' axes, block sizes, and block contents to determine if they are equal.
2. The `equals` method calls other internal methods such as `_consolidate_inplace` to prepare the data for comparison.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data but in the same format. The `equals` method should return `False` in this case, but it currently returns `True`.
4. The bug stems from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. If two blocks have the same content but different locations, the method incorrectly considers them equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider both content and block locations for equality.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to include block locations when creating a canonical representation of a block.
- Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to check for equality based on content and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())  # Include block values for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the `equals` method should properly compare blocks based on content and locations, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
