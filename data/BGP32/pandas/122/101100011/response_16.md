### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function checks for equality between two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes, then consolidates the blocks and checks their equality.
3. The bug is likely in the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` which results in incorrect equality checks.
4. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the issue with DataFrame equality check when the block order and data are not the same.
5. The GitHub issue confirms the problem, where DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in some cases due to different block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists after sorting them by `canonicalize` function. The sorting does not consider the order of blocks correctly potentially leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a way that correctly identifies equivalent blocks in `self` and `other` instances.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort by dtype name and then compare mgr_locs as arrays
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Result:
With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed and the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully without returning True incorrectly.
