### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class and return `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights a scenario where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` due to identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function where it doesn't consider the block locations when determining equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider both block values and locations to determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
        # including block locations in the canonicalization process
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Update comparison logic to consider both block values and locations
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) 
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should properly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` class taking into account block values and their locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be considered unequal, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
