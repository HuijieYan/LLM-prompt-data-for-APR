### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals(self, other)` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes in both `BlockManager` objects is the same. Then, it iterates over the axes and calls the `equals` method on each pair of axes. After that, it consolidates both objects in place before comparing the number of blocks they have. Finally, it tries to compare the blocks in a canonicalized order.
3. The bug causes DataFrame equals() to return True even when there are identical blocks with different locations due to how the canonicalization is done and how block comparison is handled.
4. To fix the bug, we can avoid sorting the blocks based on their types and locations but rather directly compare the blocks in the original order.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without trying to canonicalize their order, the bug that caused `DataFrame.equals()` to return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations should be fixed.
