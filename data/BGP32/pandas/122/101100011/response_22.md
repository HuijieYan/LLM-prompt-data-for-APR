### Analysis:
The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals()` method incorrectly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This suggests that the code fails to handle cases where the block locations are different but the content is the same.

### Error Location:
The issue likely arises in the comparison of blocks within the `equals()` function. It sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but this sorting may not handle cases where the content of the blocks is the same but the locations differ.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the `canonicalize()` function is used to sort the blocks. It solely relies on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to identify the blocks, which may not differentiate blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to consider the content of the blocks as well, not just their data types and manager locations. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and compared.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block values in the `canonicalize()` function to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are still correctly identified. It should address the bug reported on GitHub and make the `equals()` function behave as expected.
