## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is checking for equality between two block managers by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, sorting blocks based on certain criteria, and then comparing each block individually to check for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two pandas DataFrames are equal, but they have different values in the columns.
3. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not correctly handle the case where the block has different values in the same column locations. This leads to incorrect equality comparison and ultimately returns `True` when it should be `False`.

## Fixes:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. We can change the criteria for generating the tuple to include the values from the blocks as well. This way, blocks with identical values but different locations will be considered unequal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (
                block.dtype.name,
                block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
                block.values.tolist(),
            )
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the block values in the tuple generated by the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that even if the locations of the blocks are different, they will be considered unequal if their values differ. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
