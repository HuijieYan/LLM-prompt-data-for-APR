### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function first compares the axes of the two objects and then consolidates them before comparing the blocks.
3. The bug is caused by not considering the order of blocks during comparison, leading to incorrect results.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` demonstrates this bug by comparing two DataFrames with different block locations but identical blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals()` function is due to the comparison of blocks without considering their order. The `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks based on type name and locations is incorrect. This leads to incorrect comparison results when identical blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals()` function correctly compares `BlockManager` objects, we need to update the `canonicalize()` function to consider the block locations as well. By modifying the sorting criteria to include block locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the `canonicalize()` function to include block locations when sorting, the corrected `equals()` function should now provide the correct comparison results and pass the failing test. This fix resolves the issue reported on GitHub about `equals()` wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
