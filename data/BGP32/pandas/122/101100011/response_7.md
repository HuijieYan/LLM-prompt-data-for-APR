### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas.core.internals.managers` is checking for equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue mentioned in GitHub is related to `DataFrame.equals` wrongly returning `True` when the blocks have different locations.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function might not be handling the case where identical blocks have different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This sorting might not be appropriate for handling blocks with the same values but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to compare blocks. This sorting based on dtype name and location can cause the comparison to fail for identical blocks with different locations, leading to a `True` result for `equals`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider block values along with dtype and locations for better comparison.
2. Modify the comparison logic to handle identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _block_data(block):
    return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=_block_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=_block_data)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name and block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks in `DataFrame` have different locations and return the correct result for equality. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
