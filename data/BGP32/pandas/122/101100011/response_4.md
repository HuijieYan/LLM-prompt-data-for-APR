### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The issue in the function is that it fails to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances properly due to unconsolidated blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for two `DataFrame` instances with identical blocks but different locations.

### Location of Bug:
The bug is located in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals` function, where the block order is not correctly canonicalized, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not handling unconsolidated blocks properly. In the failing test, when `df1.equals(df2)` is called, it should return `False` since the blocks have different data even though they are identical.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to canonicalize the block order properly before comparing them. This involves sorting the blocks based on a custom key that combines the type name and manager locations to ensure correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the `equals` function as shown above, it should correctly handle the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.

This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug, ensuring that `equals` returns `False` for identical blocks with different locations within two `DataFrame` instances.
