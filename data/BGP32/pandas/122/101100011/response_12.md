### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function is supposed to check if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug causes the function to return True even when the blocks are not identical due to the uncanonical order of blocks.
4. The bug can be fixed by sorting the blocks based on their type name and location before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the blocks are not sorted in a canonical order before comparison. This leads to the function returning True even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a canonical order before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate and considers the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        # Sort blocks in canonical order before comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

Running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass without any issues.
