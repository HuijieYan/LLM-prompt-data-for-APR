### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue reported on GitHub states that the function is returning True incorrectly in cases where identical blocks have different locations.
2. The `equals` function compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them, and then compares the blocks. However, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function could be causing the issue.
3. The cause of the bug could be that the `canonicalize` function is not able to properly distinguish blocks with identical data but different locations, resulting in a false positive comparison.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to either modify how the blocks are sorted for comparison in a way that correctly considers differences in block locations or to improve how block locations are accounted for during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare each block based on content and locations
    for idx, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock) or not block._blknos.equals(oblock._blknos):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By updating the `equals` function to compare each block based on content and locations, this corrected version aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test provided.
