## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of the class and determining if they are equal.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug arises because the function does not take block locations into account when comparing the blocks within the DataFrames, leading to incorrect equality checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks to consider block locations. This will ensure that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the tuple, the corrected version of the `equals` function now properly considers block locations when comparing DataFrames. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
