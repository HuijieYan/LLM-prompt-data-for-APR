### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames that have the same values but different order, expecting them to be not equal.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior of `equals` method when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. It fails to properly account for cases where blocks have the same content but are located at different positions.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function first decides if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes.
2. It then attempts to canonicalize the block order using a sorting method based on block type and location.
3. However, the `canonicalize` function does not consider scenarios where blocks might have the same content but are in different locations.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To resolve the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function accommodates scenarios where blocks have the same content but different positions.
2. Update the sorting mechanism to properly distinguish blocks in such cases.
3. Refactor the `equals` method to consider block content equivalence rather than just order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def equivalent_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
        
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        any(equivalent_blocks(block, oblock) for oblock in other_blocks)
        for block in self_blocks
    )
```

By making the comparison of blocks more robust and ensuring that equivalent blocks are identified regardless of their locations, we can fix the bug and make the `equals` method behave as expected, passing the failing test case.
