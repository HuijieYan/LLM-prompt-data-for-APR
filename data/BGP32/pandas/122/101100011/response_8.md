## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, which is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The bug occurs when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations.
3. The bug is due to not considering the block locations during comparison. When sorting the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`, unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations can end up in different orders, causing false negatives in the equality check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for distinguishing unconsolidated blocks with the same content. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not deemed equal when they shouldn't be.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # Include block locations in the canonicalize comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly handle comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
