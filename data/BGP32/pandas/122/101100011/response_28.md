### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column value types and expects them to not be equal, which is correct.

3. The issue on GitHub highlights that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is the bug observed in the current implementation of the `equals` function.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is in the `equals` function where it wrongly returns `True` when comparing blocks with different locations due to the sorting mechanism used in the function. The sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` causes equal blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block type for comparison and ignore the locations.
2. Modify the sorting based on block type only to avoid considering block locations.
3. Update the comparison logic of blocks to ignore the locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function will now compare blocks based on their type only, ignoring the locations, as required to fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
