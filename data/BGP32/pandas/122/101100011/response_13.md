### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas is designed to check equality between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager`, as blocks can have the same content but different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True`.

### Error Location
The bug occurs when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` using the `equals` function. The sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using `canonicalize` function can lead to incorrect results due to different block locations even if the block content is the same.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling blocks with the same content but different locations. The bug arises from sorting blocks based on a combination of the dtype name and the locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`), which may not correctly differentiate between blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to focus only on the content of the blocks for comparison. This will ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to focus on block content only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to use the `values` attribute of the blocks and compare them directly using `tobytes()`. This approach ensures that blocks with the same content are considered equal irrespective of their locations. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
