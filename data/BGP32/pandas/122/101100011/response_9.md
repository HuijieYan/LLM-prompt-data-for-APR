### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug occurs when identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal, leading to a false positive result.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` asserts that two DataFrames with columns swapped are not equal, but the buggy `equals` method returns True.
5. The bug is reported in GitHub issue #28839.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare blocks. It only considers the block's type name and the location of the blocks but fails to consider other aspects that are relevant for equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider additional information that affects equality comparison, such as the actual data within the blocks.
2. Use a more robust sorting mechanism that takes into account all relevant details for equality comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic to ensure that blocks are correctly compared based on all relevant information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new function to canonicalize blocks considering all relevant information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    # Sort blocks based on the new canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks by checking all attributes for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` method now considers all relevant details of the blocks for comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
