## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is overriding the existing `equals` method in the class without adding any new functionality.
2. The bug occurs when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations due to the sorting inconsistency in the `equals` function.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by expecting a `False` result when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with columns swapped, but the current implementation returns `True`.
4. To fix this bug, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to consider the block order more accurately.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to also include the block values in addition to their type and locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on the modified `canonicalize` function to ensure a more accurate comparison.
3. Use a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.block_values.tolist())` for sorting the blocks.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions in the class remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Updated canonicalize function to include block values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.block_values.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function for sorting and comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function now ensures a proper comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
