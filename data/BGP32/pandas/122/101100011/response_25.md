### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing DataFrames using the `equals` method by going through axes, blocks, and ordering them based on dtype.name and mgr_locs. 
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two DataFrames with different values are considered not equal. 
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The issue seems to be with how the blocks are being compared and ordered in the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method incorrectly considers DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as equal due to the way blocks are being ordered.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `equals` method to correctly compare DataFrames without considering the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()

    def normalize_df(df):
        return df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).sort_index(axis=1)

    self_normalized = normalize_df(pd.concat(self_blocks, axis=1))
    other_normalized = normalize_df(pd.concat(other_blocks, axis=1))

    return self_normalized.equals(other_normalized)
```

This corrected version modifies the `equals` method to normalize the DataFrames by only considering numerical columns, sorting them, and then comparing. This way, the bug related to identical blocks with different locations is fixed, and the failing test should pass.
