### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue reported in the GitHub thread indicates that the `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug appears in the comparison logic of the `equals()` function, specifically in the `canonicalize()` function where the sorting of blocks is done. This sorting is based on a tuple combining the type name and manager locations, which may lead to incorrect equality comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize()` function sorts the blocks based on a tuple combining the dtype name and manager locations of each block. Due to this, blocks that are equal but have different locations are not correctly identified as equal.
2. This discrepancy is due to the difference in block locations after consolidation, which affects the equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality comparison logic in the `equals()` function. We can change the sorting key to a more robust method that doesn't depend on block locations but only on content. By doing this, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype name for correct comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated logic, the `equals()` function will correctly compare the blocks based on their dtype names, ensuring that identical blocks are identified as equal irrespective of their locations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
