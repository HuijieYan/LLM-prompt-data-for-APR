### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function may not be correctly sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` leading to incorrect comparison.
2. The comparison logic in the `return` statement might not be correctly checking the equality of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the incorrect comparison logic between the blocks of two DataFrames. The function first sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and manager locations of the blocks. However, this sorting might not be accurate, resulting in incorrect comparisons. Additionally, the final comparison using `all` might not be correctly checking the equality of corresponding blocks, leading to a false equality result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper sorting based on block type and locations.
2. Modify the comparison logic to accurately compare corresponding blocks from `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` arrays.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Add named custom sort key function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function now properly sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, and accurately compares the corresponding blocks for equality. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` function behaves correctly.
