### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
   
2. The function compares two objects `self` and `other`, specifically their axes and blocks. It first checks if the number of axes is the same, then compares each axis, then consolidates the axes, and finally compares the blocks by canonicalizing the block order.
   
3. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal()` tests the `equals()` method on two DataFrames with columns of different data types and expects the result to be `False` because the DataFrames are not equal.
   
4. The GitHub issue describes this bug as DataFrame `equals()` function wrongly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks in the `equals()` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function without considering the actual values in the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type and locations, which leads to identical blocks with different locations being treated as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values in the blocks instead of just sorting based on type and locations. We should ensure that the values in the blocks are compared accurately for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on values, not just type and location
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    # compare blocks based on values, not just type and location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.iloc[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key= lambda block: block.values.iloc[0])
    
    return all(
        blocks_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version added a `blocks_equal` function to compare the values in each block. The blocks are now sorted based on the first value within each block, ensuring that the values are compared accurately for equality. This fixes the bug in the `equals` function.
