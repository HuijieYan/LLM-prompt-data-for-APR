## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing `self_axes` and `other_axes` without ensuring they are the same length.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without first consolidating them.
3. Using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function without ensuring it is valid.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from comparing DataFrame blocks in the `equals` function without ensuring that they are in a consistent state (consolidated and sorted). Thus, when the DataFrame blocks are identical but have different locations due to being unconsolidated, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that `self_axes` and `other_axes` have the same length before comparison.
2. Consolidate both `self` and `other` DataFrames before comparing their blocks.
3. Ensure that the variable `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function is valid and handles unconsolidated blocks.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrame blocks while handling potential inconsistencies in their location due to consolidation. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
