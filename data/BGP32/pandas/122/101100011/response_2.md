### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The bug is causing `DataFrame.equals()` to wrongly return `True` for cases where two DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by comparing two DataFrames with different data but the same structure and expecting a result of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug is likely occurring because the function `equals(self, other)` is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.
2. To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality check process to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their order.
3. We should sort both self and other blocks based on their content, not their order, before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

### The corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared, passing the failing test case provided.
