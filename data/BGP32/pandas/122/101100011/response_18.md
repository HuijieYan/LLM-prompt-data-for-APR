### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal by comparing their blocks. The issue arises when the blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to the incorrect return value of `True`.

### Identified Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `equals` function where the blocks of `self` and `other` are being compared without considering the fact that blocks with the same content but different locations should not be considered equal.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks for comparison does not take into account the block locations. As a result, identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, leading to the incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block contents and their locations. This way, blocks with the same content but different locations will not be considered equal during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.flat)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        and (block.mgr_locs.values == oblock.mgr_locs.values).all()  # Check block locations
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares both the block contents and their locations in the `equals` function. Now, identical blocks with different locations will not be mistakenly considered equal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
