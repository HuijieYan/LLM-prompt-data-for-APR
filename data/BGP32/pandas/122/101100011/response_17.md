### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` method is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides a case where two DataFrames are constructed with different data but are mistakenly considered equal by the `equals` method.
4. The GitHub issue highlights this bug where the `equals` method returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManagers` based on their data type names and `mgr_locs`. This sorting operation causes identical blocks with different locations to be compared as different, leading to incorrect results in the `equals` method.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate a more robust comparison of blocks. We should consider comparing the content of the blocks themselves, rather than just the data type names and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal. This change should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the `equals` method more robust.
