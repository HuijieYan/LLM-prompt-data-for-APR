### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks but fails to consider the case of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` highlights a scenario where two dataframes with different data types but identical blocks are incorrectly considered equal.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly in such cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison done in the `equals` method, where it fails to handle the case of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to two dataframes being incorrectly considered equal when they are not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include location information of the blocks as well. This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, including locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the provided corrected version, the bug in the original function is addressed by considering the locations of the blocks in the comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.
