### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and values.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` unexpectedly.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrame instances with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function that does not consider block locations properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks are at different locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare blocks by considering their positions.
2. Fix the comparison logic to account for the case when identical blocks are in different locations.
3. Ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances reflects the actual equality even if the block locations are different.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will address the issue reported on GitHub. After applying this fix, the failing test case should pass successfully.
