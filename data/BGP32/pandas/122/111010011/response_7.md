### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library.
- The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The error message shows that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
- The GitHub issue also confirms that the `equals` method is returning `True` erroneously.
- The cause of the bug seems to be incorrect block comparison due to different block locations.

### Error:
The bug in the `equals` method is due to comparing blocks iteratively in the presence of different block locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the block ordering in a way that would correctly identify identical blocks with different locations. One approach to achieve this is by comparing based on block content rather than block locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values == other.get(block.mgr_locs).values).all()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their content, ensuring that blocks with the same content are identified as equal, even if they have different locations. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the `equals` method function correctly.
