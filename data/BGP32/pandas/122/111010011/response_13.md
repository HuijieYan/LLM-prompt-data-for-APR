### Analyze the buggy function

1. The buggy function is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` function within `BlockManager` is responsible for checking if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the test to check the inequality of two DataFrames fails, displaying an unexpected `True` result.
4. The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights a similar problem with `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Identify potential error locations

1. The bug may be caused by the comparison routine between blocks in the `equals` function.
2. The way blocks are sorted and compared could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Explain the cause of the bug

The bug is likely due to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instance. If two DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations, the current comparison logic may incorrectly return `True`. This suggests a flaw in the sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should revise how the blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` function. The comparison should consider block contents regardless of their locations.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data, disregarding location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version focuses on sorting the blocks based on their values and data types to compare the content rather than their locations. This should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
