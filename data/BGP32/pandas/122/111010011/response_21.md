### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of the class based on their axes, blocks, and corresponding block data.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when two DataFrames with different values are compared using the `equals` method.
3. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks in the `equals` function, as it does not account for different block locations even if the block data is different.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle cases where the block data is identical but the locations are different.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks after sorting based on both dtype name and mgr_locs, the corrected version ensures that the `equals` method correctly identifies when two DataFrames have the same values but differ by block locations.
