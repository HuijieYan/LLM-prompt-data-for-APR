### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same error where `equals` method returns `True` instead of `False` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
5. The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks is not taking the location of the blocks into account.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method.
2. When comparing blocks, the function should consider the location in addition to the block content.
3. Since the blocks are not being canonically ordered, the comparison does not consider their actual positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider both block content and their location.
2. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on content and location before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a function to get a canonical representation of the block for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Corrected Version Explanation:
1. Added sorting of blocks based on their values and locations using the `canonicalize` function.
2. Compare blocks based on both values and locations using `block.values.equals` and `block.mgr_locs.equals`.
3. This corrected version ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal.
