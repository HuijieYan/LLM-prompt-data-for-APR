### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` library.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it evaluates to `True is False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to DataFrame comparison where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the problem and provides a test case where the expected result is False.
5. The issue is mostly due to incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared.
- The faulty logic lies in sorting and comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the order of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations.
- One approach could be to compare the contents of the blocks while ignoring the block order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return (self_blocks_content == other_blocks_content)
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version compares the contents of the blocks directly without sorting, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations.
- This fix should make the `equals` method handle DataFrame comparisons correctly and pass the failing test case.
