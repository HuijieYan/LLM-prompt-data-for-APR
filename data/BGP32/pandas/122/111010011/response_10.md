### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is intended to check if two BlockManager instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks having identical contents but different locations.
2. The error occurs when the test case tries to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but it actually returns `True`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely the way the blocks are compared by sorting them and then checking equality between corresponding blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the block comparison logic to handle cases where blocks have identical contents but different locations. One solution could be to extract the content of blocks and compare them directly.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `equals()` function below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_data = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_data = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_block_data == other_block_data
```

This corrected version extracts the data values of blocks and directly compares them using the `==` operator to determine equality. This should resolve the issue of blocks with identical content but different locations erroneously being marked as unequal.
