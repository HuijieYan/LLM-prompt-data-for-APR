### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their blocks. This function is intended to return `False` if the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.
2. The bug originates from the comparison logic in the `equals` function where it wrongly returns `True` even if the blocks have different locations.
3. The error message is indicating that the comparison is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This error is consistent with the bug described in the GitHub issue.
4. The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in a way that does not consider the order or locations of the blocks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly handle cases where blocks are identical in content but have different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we should modify the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks as well as their locations.
2. We can achieve this by comparing the content of blocks based on their data and indices, rather than just their memory locations.
3. We need to ensure that blocks are sorted and compared in a consistent manner to prevent false positives.
4. By properly canonicalizing the blocks based on their data and indices, we can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Updated Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (tuple(block.items), block.get_values().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `equals` function as shown above, we introduce a consistent and accurate way of comparing blocks within two `BlockManager` objects. This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
