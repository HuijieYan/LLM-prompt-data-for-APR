### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in pandas core is not comparing the data blocks correctly.
2. The function checks if the axes of two objects are equal, then consolidates the objects in-place, and finally compares the blocks. 
3. The bug causes the `DataFrame.equals` method to return `True` incorrectly even when the blocks are not equal but have different locations.
4. The bug is reported on GitHub with details of the expected output and versions used.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function after the _consolidate_inplace method is called. This changes the block locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the `_consolidate_inplace` calls before comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By removing the `_consolidate_inplace` calls in the `equals` function, the comparison will be made on the original block data, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
