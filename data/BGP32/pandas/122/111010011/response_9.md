### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two objects. The function first compares the lengths of the `axes` of the two objects. If the lengths are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it consolidates the data and compares the lengths of the `blocks`. If the lengths are not equal, it returns `False` as well.
2. The main issue arises in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. In the current implementation, the order of the blocks is not accounted for, leading to incorrect comparison results.
3. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` call is returning `True` when it should return `False` due to different data in the blocks.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the order of the blocks is accounted for in the comparison process.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the order information of the blocks.
2. Update the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to consider the type name and manager locations of the blocks when comparing.
3. Re-implement the `equals` logic to compare the sorted blocks with the proper order information included.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and mgr_locs to maintain order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_values())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the manager locations and sorting the blocks accordingly, the corrected version ensures that the comparisons between the two objects will consider the order of the blocks, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
