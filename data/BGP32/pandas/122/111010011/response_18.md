### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
- The failing test is trying to compare two instances of `DataFrame` using the `equals` method and expects it to return `False`.
- The error message shows that the test is failing because `True` is being returned instead of `False`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug might be occurring in the comparison process of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the way the blocks are being sorted using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function combines the block's data type name and manager locations to ensure consistent ordering. However, in cases where identical blocks exist in different locations, they should not be considered equal, leading to the incorrect `True` return in the `equals` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` method to take into account the actual block data rather than just the ordering based on data type and location. This change will ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the content of the blocks rather than just their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, the `equals` method will now correctly compare the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report and making the failing test pass.
