### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two block managers (`self` and `other`) to check if they are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because `True` is being returned when it should be `False`.
3. The GitHub issue further explains that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug seems to be related to how block locations are compared and sorted in the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method stems from the way block locations are compared and sorted. Due to incorrect sorting, blocks with identical values but different locations are considered as equal, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` method. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly treated as equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by sorting blocks based on data type and locations, ensuring that blocks with identical values but different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
