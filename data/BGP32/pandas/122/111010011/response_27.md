### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two `BlockManager` objects and checks if they are equal.
2. The error message states that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function returns True instead of False, which is incorrect.
3. The problem arises from the comparison logic where the blocks are being sorted and compared. There seems to be an issue in the way blocks are being sorted and checked for equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to debug the sorting and equality comparison of blocks within the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the block sorting and equality comparison logic to ensure correct comparison between blocks.
2. Check the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to correctly sort blocks for comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic to accurately compare each block between the two `BlockManager` objects.
4. Test the corrected version to verify that the `equals` function returns the correct result for the provided test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and
    # then values because comparing mgr_locs might not be sufficient
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
