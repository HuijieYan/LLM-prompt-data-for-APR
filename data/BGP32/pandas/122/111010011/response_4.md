### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
3. The bug causes the method to erroneously return `True` when checking for equality in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing and returning `True` instead of `False`.
5. The GitHub issue confirms this bug and expects the method to return `False` in such cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is mainly due to the comparison being performed based on the order of blocks rather than the actual content within the blocks. The `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the blocks does not consider the values of blocks accurately.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of sorting and comparing the blocks within the `equals` method. Instead of relying on block order and locations, the comparison should be based on the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly by values
    self_blocks_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_values, other_blocks_values)
    )
```

By directly comparing the values of the blocks rather than relying on their order and locations, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now return `False` as expected for the provided test case and fix the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
