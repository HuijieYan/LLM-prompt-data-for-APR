### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is `equals(self, other)` which is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error occurs within the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
3. The error message indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and it should have returned `False`. The issue on GitHub confirms this inconsistency in the `equals` method.
4. The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of blocks in a non-canonical order, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
5. To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks based on a canonical criteria before comparing them.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Canonicalize block order based on dtype name and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), repr(block.mgr_locs))
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`, we ensure a consistent comparison order. This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
