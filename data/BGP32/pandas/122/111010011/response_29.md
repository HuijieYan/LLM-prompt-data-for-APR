### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` class (`self` and `other`) for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents.
3. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` call is erroneously returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The identified issue is related to the canonicalization of blocks where identical blocks might have different locations resulting in incorrect equality comparison.
5. The GitHub issue confirms the bug where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for DataFrame instances with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises in the buggy function's comparison logic where the blocks are not correctly canonicalized, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the canonicalization of blocks should be adjusted to consider both the block type name and the block's content locations to differentiate identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using block content and type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_shared(locations=True).nbytes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying the corrected logic for canonicalization based on block content locations ensures that blocks with identical contents but different locations are correctly compared, resolving the bug.
