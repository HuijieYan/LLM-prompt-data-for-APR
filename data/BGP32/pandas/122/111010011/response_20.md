### Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas.
- The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, showing incorrect results.
- The bug was reported on GitHub, and the issue title and detailed description indicate the expected behavior and the problem encountered.
- The failing test checks the equality of two DataFrames with different data, expecting the result to be False, but the buggy code returns True.

### Bug Identification
- The bug is likely caused by comparing blocks of data without considering their actual content, leading to incorrect equality checks.
- The function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, which may not guarantee correct comparison if the order of blocks differs between two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their type names and locations.
- Update the `equals` method to compare the content of each block in a DataFrame.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data) for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `equals` method now correctly compares the actual data content of blocks within two DataFrames, ensuring a more accurate equality check. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
