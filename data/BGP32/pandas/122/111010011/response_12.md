### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, consolidating them in-place, and then comparing the blocks within them.
3. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is failing because it returns `True` instead of `False`. This is consistent with the GitHub issue where the user expects it to return `False`, but it returns `True`.
4. The root cause of the bug is that the comparison of `BlockManager` blocks is done based on an incorrect canonicalization function, leading to identical blocks with different locations being wrongly considered as equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that considers block content and location together for accurate comparison.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the hash values of block content along with the bytes representation of block locations for accurate comparison. This modification ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are not wrongly considered as equal.
