### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the issue identified in the GitHub bug report.
2. The issue is related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method, where DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are incorrectly considered equal.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing when it shouldn't, leading to incorrect results.
4. The bug occurs due to the order of blocks within DataFrames not being considered during comparison, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of blocks within DataFrames during comparison. One approach could be to modify the `equals` function to check for equality based on both block content and block order within the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Consider block order as well for comparison
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `equals` function to consider the order of blocks within the DataFrames during comparison, the issue identified in the GitHub bug report should be resolved.
