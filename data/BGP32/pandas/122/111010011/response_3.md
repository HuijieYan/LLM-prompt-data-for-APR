### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames fails, leading to an `AssertionError`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which should return `False`.
4. The bug seems to be occurring due to the comparison logic in the `equals` function where the block order is canonicalized before comparing, causing incorrect results.
5. We need to address the canonicalization of block order to correctly compare DataFrames. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where identical blocks with different locations should be considered unequal. This can be achieved by improving the way blocks are ordered before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods and class attributes...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: block._unit_key)
        other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: block._unit_key)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that blocks are ordered properly before comparison using the `_unit_key` attribute to account for identical blocks with different locations. This update should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the comparison behavior more accurate.
