### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and the order of blocks are identical.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method mistakenly returns `True`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the function is not behaving as expected for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug occurs due to blocks with different locations being considered duplicates, leading to an incorrect equality result.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations.
A potential strategy could involve comparing the contents of the blocks and not just the locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare block contents, not just locations
        def canonicalize_block(bm):
            return {k: bm._get_block(k).values for k in range(bm.shape[1])}

        self_blocks_content = [canonicalize_block(self)]  
        other_blocks_content = [canonicalize_block(other)]

        return all(block in other_blocks_content for block in self_blocks_content)

```

By comparing the actual block contents in the corrected version, the `equals` function will correctly detect the difference between identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result.
