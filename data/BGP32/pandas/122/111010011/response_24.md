### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class overrides the `equals` method with a different implementation than the original `equals` method defined in the class.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method in the buggy function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal.
3. The GitHub issue also confirms that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with different block locations.
4. The bug seems to originate from how the blocks are compared and sorted based on their properties.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations so that unconsolidated blocks are correctly distinguished during comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue. It sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations, ensuring that the comparison is accurate even for unconsolidated blocks.
