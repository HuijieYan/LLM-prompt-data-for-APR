### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
3. The bug arises from comparing blocks based on their order and not on their content, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their order.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks based on content and not on order
        # Sort blocks based on their dtype.name for comparison
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
        
        return all(
            np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and then compares their content using the `np.array_equal` function, ensuring correct comparison.
