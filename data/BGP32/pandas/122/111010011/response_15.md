### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two sets of blocks from two instances of the class. It checks if the `axes` are of equal length, then consolidates the blocks in-place for both instances before comparing the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks and checks if each block from one instance equals the corresponding block from the other instance.
2. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` but it is returning `True`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar case where `df3.equals(df4)` was expected to return `False` but it returned `True`. This is due to the fact that the code for comparing blocks does not consider different block locations properly, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are compared by considering not only the block types but also their locations to ensure a correct comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include information about block locations in addition to block types.
2. Update the comparison logic to include block locations when checking for equality.
3. Ensure that the comparison considers block type and locations in the sorting step to prevent false positives in equality checks.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This updated version takes into account the locations of blocks in addition to their types when comparing them, ensuring a correct equality check.
