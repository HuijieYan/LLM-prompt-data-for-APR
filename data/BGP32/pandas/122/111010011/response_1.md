### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if they are equal. This involves comparing the axes, consolidating blocks, and comparing individual blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` when it should return `False` for two data frames that are not equal.
3. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks at the end of the `equals` method. The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly consider the difference in block locations when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the location of blocks along with their data type in the tuple for better sorting.
2. In the comparison loop, ensure that not only the blocks are equal but also their positions are checked to account for identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using type name, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # check for equality of each block and their locations
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        # check for location differences
        if canonicalize(block) != canonicalize(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the comparison will also consider the location of the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are treated as not equal.
