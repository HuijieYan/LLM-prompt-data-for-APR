### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The buggy function fails to return the correct result when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
   
2. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with identical blocks but different locations, expecting the result to be `False`.

3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.

4. The GitHub issue reports the same problem, indicating that when comparing DataFrames with different block locations but identical values, the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the blocks of self and other objects without considering the correct comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

The function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`. Due to different locations but identical values, the sorting does not differentiate them, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations. We can compare the blocks directly based on their content rather than sorting them using `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in the DataFrames `self` and `other`, ensuring that the comparison considers identical blocks with different locations properly.
