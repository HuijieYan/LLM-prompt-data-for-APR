### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py`.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method of Pandas.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The issue is caused by incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.

### Error Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly handle identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. We can achieve this by canonicalizing the blocks based on their type name and location before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is done consistently and accurately.

Let's correct the `equals` function:

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the block's data type and location values, we ensure that blocks are correctly ordered before comparing them. This change fixes the incorrect behavior when handling identical blocks with different locations.
