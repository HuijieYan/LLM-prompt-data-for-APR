### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class checks whether two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function calls `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` to consolidate the blocks before comparison.
3. The buggy function then sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs before comparing them.
4. The failing test indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` incorrectly even though the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have different values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `equals` does not properly take into account the actual data values in the blocks while comparing the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data values in the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances instead of just comparing the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare blocks directly
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the values in the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual data instead of just block characteristics. This should fix the bug and make the function behave correctly.
