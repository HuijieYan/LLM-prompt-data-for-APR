### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`. This contradicts the expected behavior.

### Error location in the buggy function

The bug likely resides in the comparison of the block contents using the `equals` method. Given that the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations, the function does not account for this distinction, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Cause of the bug

The bug stems from the fact that the function does not properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations. It sorts the blocks based on the type name and location without considering the corresponding DataFrames. As a result, the `equals` comparison at the end returns `True` even when the actual DataFrames are not equal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method takes into account the actual content of the blocks, not just their type and location.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the equality comparison of the blocks in the BlockManager objects is based on the content of the blocks, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations leading to incorrect equality comparison.
