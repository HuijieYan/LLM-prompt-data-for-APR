The bug in the `equals` function lies in incorrect comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to come up with a better approach to compare the blocks in a way that ensures the correct comparison. One potential solution is to directly compare the content of each block within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, we ensure that the content of the blocks is correctly verified for equality which should resolve the issue.
