### Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the DataFrame class and causes it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The error message indicates that the assertion comparing `df1.equals(df2)` is failing, showing that the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
- The bug is related to the way the block order is canonicalized and compared within the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `equals` method compares the blocks of two DataFrames by sorting them based on both the dtype name and the manager locations but fails to consider unconsolidated blocks.
- The canonicalization of block order using dtype name and mgr_locs might not be sufficient to distinguish unconsolidated blocks leading to false positives.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the canonicalization mechanism to consider unconsolidated blocks and uniquely identify them during comparison.
- Modify the sorting criteria to incorporate a more robust method that accounts for unconsolidated blocks to correctly identify differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order properly considering unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, (CategoricalBlock, FloatBlock, etc.)):  # Update with actual block types
            return (block._fastpath, block.values)
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating a more comprehensive approach to canonicalize and sort the blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should be able to correctly identify DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations and return `False`, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
