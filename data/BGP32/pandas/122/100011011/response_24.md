### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances in pandas. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates them in place and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
   
2. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison should return `False`, but it returns `True`.

3. The runtime values and types show that the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are being compared. The problem arises when sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which may not handle different orderings of identical blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is sorting the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which may not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This leads to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for blocks. We should ensure that the comparison takes into account identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modify the canonicalize function to handle different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare based on the values of the blocks themselves, we can handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function return the expected results.
