### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, which contain axes and blocks. The function first compares the axes and then proceeds to compare individual blocks. The bug arises when sorting the blocks based on their `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`. Due to the unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical), the comparison fails to distinguish between them in some cases.

The test case provided in the GitHub issue involves two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which should return `False`. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it incorrectly evaluates to `True`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function, which combines `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations due to the way it sorts and compares the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider blocks with different locations as unequal when comparing. This change will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to consider mgr_locs for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the string representation of `mgr_locs`, we ensure that blocks with different locations are properly sorted and compared, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
