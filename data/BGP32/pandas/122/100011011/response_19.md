### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
3. The runtime values and types of variables show that the issue arises when comparing `Block` objects within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the problem lies in `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The incorrect comparison occurs due to the `canonicalize` function not properly handling block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function not considering block locations properly. This causes identical blocks with different locations to compare as equal, leading to the incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function considers block locations in addition to dtype names. By including the block locations in the canonicalization process, we can differentiate between blocks that may have the same dtype but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `mgr_locs` in the comparison, ensuring that blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal. This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
