### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test:

1. The buggy function is the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on axes and blocks.
   
2. The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. The error message shows that the assertion failed because it evaluated to `True`.

3. The test is failing because the function is incorrectly determining the equality of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Explanation:

1. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If not, it returns `False`, which is correct.

2. The function then checks if all axes are equal using a generator expression with `zip(self_axes, other_axes)`. This check should return `False` if any pair of axes are not equal.

3. The subsequent lines of the function attempt to canonicalize and sort the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance for comparison. However, the canonicalization process is flawed, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. The bug seems to originate from the `canonicalize` function's implementation. It currently tries to use both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to differentiate blocks.

2. To address the bug, we should simplify the sort key to focus on block content rather than manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to only consider dtype name for simplicity
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By simplifying the sort key in the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name`, we eliminate the issue of miscomparing blocks with different manager locations. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
