### Explanation:

The `equals()` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances and determine if they are equal. The bug is caused by incorrect sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` when comparing the blocks. As a result, even though the content of the blocks might be the same, the comparison fails due to the blocks being in a different order.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `canonicalize()` function where the blocks are being sorted based on the type name and the locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize()` function is sorting the blocks based on type name and locations, potentially changing the order of the blocks.
2. The sort order of the blocks affects the equality check even if the content is the same.
3. This sorting inconsistency leads to the `equals()` function returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in a consistent order. One approach can be to modify the `canonicalize()` function to consider only the type name for sorting and disregard the locations:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return block.dtype.name
```

This change will ensure that blocks are sorted based only on their type names, maintaining a consistent order for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By applying the corrected version of the function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass correctly.
