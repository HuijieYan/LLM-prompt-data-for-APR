### Analysis:
The `equals()` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly in a specific case where the blocks have different locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The `canonicalize()` function is used to sort blocks based on their dtype and locations, but it does not handle the case where blocks have identical values but different locations. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to incorporate unique identifiers that differentiate blocks with identical values but different locations. This will ensure that the function accurately compares the blocks and returns the correct result.

### Corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Check if the number of axes is the same
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if each pair of axes is equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check if the number of blocks is the same
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype, data, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.index)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if each pair of blocks is equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function should now properly handle cases where blocks have identical values but different locations, and return the expected result of `False` when they are not equal.
