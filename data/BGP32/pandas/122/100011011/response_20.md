### Bug Analysis
1. At the heart of the issue is the comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method.
2. The failing test case compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' where values are swapped between columns.
3. The buggy function `equals` checks if the length of axes in both DataFrames is equal, then compares each axis using the `equals` method, consolidates the DataFrames, then compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function.
4. In this specific case, the `canonicalize` function doesn't differentiate between columns 'a' and 'b' as the sorting process considers both as identical, leading to the incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. We need to fix the sorting process to properly differentiate between columns 'a' and 'b' during comparison.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function or introduce an alternative method to accurately sort and compare the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering column values for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items[0], block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the updated `canonicalize` function that considers the column items for sorting, the function should now correctly differentiate between columns and compare the DataFrames accurately.
