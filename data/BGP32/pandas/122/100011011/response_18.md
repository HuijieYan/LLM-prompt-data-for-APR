### Analyzing the bug in the provided function:

1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is failing because it returns `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The function goes through the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality. It sorts the blocks based on their types and locations using a `canonicalize` function. However, the sorting criteria might not consider all differences in blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison in the `equals` function correctly identifies differences in the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if each block is equal to its counterpart in the other BlockManager
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

After applying this correction, the function should now correctly identify differences in the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances during the comparison. This modification should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
