The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is expected to consider the block content and order, but it mistakenly uses the `canonicalize` function with `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to sort and compare blocks. This leads to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, resulting in the function returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we should directly compare each block content to ensure accurate equality checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, we ensure that the content of the blocks is compared accurately, leading to the correct equality check between two `BlockManager` objects. This correction should resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
