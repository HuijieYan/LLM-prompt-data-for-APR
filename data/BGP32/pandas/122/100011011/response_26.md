### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and block contents. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`, leading to a failing test case. The GitHub issue details a similar problem where `equals` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks in `self` and `other` based on the order of their locations. However, the comparison process does not correctly handle the case where the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the comparison logic to account for cases where blocks have identical content but different locations. One approach is to compare the actual block content itself rather than relying on the order of locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the content of blocks rather than their locations, the corrected version of the function should now handle cases where identical blocks exist with different locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
