### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises from not correctly handling the case where the blocks may have identical content but different locations. The function wrongly returns `True` in such cases. The failing test case provides an example where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug likely originates from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on their types and locations. This sorting method does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
- The function `canonicalize` only uses the block's type and location to sort the blocks, ignoring the actual content of the blocks.
- When comparing two BlockManager objects with identical contents in different locations, the `canonicalize` function fails to distinguish them, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison method should consider the actual content of the blocks, not just their types and locations. One possible approach is to refactor the `canonicalize` function or the comparison logic in a way that ensures accurate equality checks based on the block's content.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly by content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the function directly compares the blocks by content instead of relying on a sorting mechanism based on block type and location. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly evaluated as unequal.
