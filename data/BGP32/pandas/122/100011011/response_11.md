### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects, which represent the internal data structures of Pandas `DataFrame` objects. The function checks the equality of axes and blocks to determine if two `DataFrame` objects are equal. 

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects that are expected to be different. This suggests that there might be an issue with the implementation of the equality check in the function.

In the provided runtime values, the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` are comparable, the issue might be arising from the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their properties. The error may be linked to the sorting approach using the `canonicalize` function.


### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the `canonicalize` function being used to sort the blocks for comparison. The `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method might not be providing a unique representation of blocks' locations, leading to incorrect sorting of blocks. This incorrect sorting could result in the function erroneously evaluating two different `DataFrame` objects as equal.


### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a unique and reproducible representation of block properties for proper sorting and comparison. One approach is to concatenate the dtype name and some unique block property that can uniquely identify each block. Additionally, verifying if the equality checks for axes and blocks are correctly implemented will be essential.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype and unique block identifier
    def canonicalize(block):
        unique_id = hash((block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()))
        return (block.dtype.name, unique_id)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected version uses the combined hash of block values and locations to create a unique identifier for each block before sorting them. This should prevent the issue of erroneously identifying different blocks as equal.
