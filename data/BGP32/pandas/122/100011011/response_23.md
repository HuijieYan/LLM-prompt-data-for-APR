### Analysis:
The issue stems from the `equals` method incorrectly returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations. The bug is in the part of the code where it sorts and compares the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and manager locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not effectively distinguish between blocks with identical contents but different locations. When comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the bug causes them to be considered equal due to the mismatch in block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional criteria that differentiate between blocks with the same content but different locations. This could involve sorting based on index values or other identifying factors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a change in the `canonicalize` function where the manager locations are represented as slices for better comparison. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
