### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The error message arises from a failing test that compares two `DataFrame` objects, `df1` and `df2`, expecting them to be not equal due to different values in cells, but the function incorrectly returns `True`.

The function checks the axes' length, then iterates over axes to compare each one. It then consolidates the blocks and sorts them based on their dtype name and manager locations before comparing them. The bug likely lies in the comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison in the return statement. The function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on dtype name and locations before comparing them. In this specific test case, the blocks contain values of different types (int64 and object), causing the comparison to fail even though the actual values are different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual values in the blocks rather than their dtype name and locations. We should compare the blocks directly instead of sorting them based on dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks, other_blocks = self.blocks, other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting based on dtype name and locations, the corrected function will properly compare the actual values in the blocks, fixing the bug.
