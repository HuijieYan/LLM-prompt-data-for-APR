### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects containing blocks of different data types (`IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`). The comparison involves sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but due to different orderings, the comparison fails even though the actual data is the same.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing blocks without considering data location.
2. Sorting blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may lead to incorrect comparisons. In this specific case:
- The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on `dtype.name` (int vs. object) and `mgr_locs`, causing the comparison to fail even though the actual data is the same.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on the actual data they contain rather than sorting them in a way that may lead to failed comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This approach ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their ordering or data types.

By making this change, the function should now correctly compare the blocks and return `True` if they are equal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
