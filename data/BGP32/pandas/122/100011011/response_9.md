### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True is False` which is incorrect.
3. The variable values and types indicate that the function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that the current implementation of `equals` method is returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` method not accounting for blocks with identical contents but different locations. This leads to cases where the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` method to consider a more robust way of determining equality, especially when dealing with blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a more comprehensive equality check by comparing block values themselves rather than their locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function more robust.
