### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because `True` is returned instead of `False`, indicating that the function incorrectly matches the two `BlockManager` objects as equal.
3. The function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which could lead to incorrect comparisons.
4. The bug occurs because the function is considering the location of the blocks while checking for equality, causing identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly considered unequal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the type name for sorting.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the dtype name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name`, we ensure that the comparison for equality is based solely on the type of blocks, fixing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
