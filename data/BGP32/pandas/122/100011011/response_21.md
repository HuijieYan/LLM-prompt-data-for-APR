### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on axes, blocks, and block order.
- Based on the error message from the failing test, `True is False` is being asserted which indicates that the comparison is failing even though it is expected to be False.
- The comparison logic seems to be correct, but there might be an issue with the blocks being compared or their order.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the function `equals` is returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations when it should return False.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.
- The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` may not be correctly considering the differences in block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for identical blocks with different locations.
- Modify the sorting logic to handle unconsolidated blocks properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values to handle different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `equals` function includes a modified `canonicalize` function that considers block values while sorting. This modification should address the issue of returning True for identical blocks with different locations and ensure the comparison behaves as expected.
