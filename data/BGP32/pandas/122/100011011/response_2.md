### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is flawed, causing the comparison to be incorrect.

The failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is triggered because the function incorrectly returns `True`. This error is due to the flawed sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function.

The input values and types provided indicate that the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` objects have identical structures but the location of the blocks is different due to the flawed sorting in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the `canonicalize` function where the sorting based on column type (`block.dtype.name`) and location (`block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`) is flawed. This flawed sorting leads to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the flawed sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function. The sorting should consider the block content itself rather than its dtype and locations, which can vary even for identical blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their content rather than their dtype and locations. By comparing the block content directly, we can ensure that identical blocks across different locations are considered equal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to sort by content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function modifies the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their contents. This change ensures that the comparison considers the actual block content rather than their dtype and locations. With this fix, the function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects for equality.
