### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing DataFrames `self` and `other` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message asserts that `True is False`, indicating that the comparison returned `True` incorrectly.
3. The runtime values show that the DataFrames have the same columns but different block positions, leading to an incorrect equality due to sorting the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`.
4. The bug arises from comparing blocks with different positions, resulting in a false positive equality check.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To correct the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers only the block contents and not their positions. Therefore, the sorting criteria should focus on block data without considering block positions.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate(inplace=True)
    other._consolidate(inplace=True)
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return str(block.values)  # Consider content for equality check

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting criteria to focus on block contents instead of positions, the corrected function will now compare blocks based on their data, ensuring correct equality checks between DataFrames.
