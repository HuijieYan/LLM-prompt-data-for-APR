### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error message is indicating that the function is returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal, leading to the assertion error in the test. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are the same between the two objects, then consolidates the blocks by sorting them based on the blocks' dtype and mgr_locs before performing the equality check.

### Issue:
The issue is arising from the way the blocks are consolidated and compared. The function first sorts the blocks using `canonicalize` function, which combines the dtype name and mgr_locs of the blocks. However, the ordering of blocks might not correctly reflect the equality of two DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure a more accurate comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. We can refactor the comparison step to directly compare each block in the blocks attribute of the `BlockManager` objects without relying on sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in the `self.blocks` attribute with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This ensures a more accurate comparison of the DataFrames and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
