### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the test case `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing even though the expected output should be `False`. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the differences between the two `BlockManager` objects `df1` and `df2`.

### Error Cause:
1. The function first compares the axes of `self` and `other` and then proceeds to compare individual blocks within the `self` and `other` objects. The problematic part lies in the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting method may not effectively distinguish blocks with different locations but identical content.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include more distinguishing features, ensuring the correct identification of blocks even if they have different locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize to include additional distinguishing features
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include both the data type, manager locations, and the actual values of the block, we enhance the sorting mechanism to correctly differentiate between blocks with identical content but different locations. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure the function returns the expected results for the failing test cases.
