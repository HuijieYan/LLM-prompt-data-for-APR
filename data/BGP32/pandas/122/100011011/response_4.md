### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, where `df1` and `df2` are instances of `pd.DataFrame`.
3. The runtime values provided show that the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects have axes and blocks that are incorrectly placed in an order that makes them equal when they shouldn't be.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` for equal blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison technique in the `equals` function not taking into account the different block locations of identical blocks, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the block locations while checking for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the block's `id()` instead of its `mgr_locs`, we ensure that blocks with different locations are not treated as equal. This change addresses the bug and should pass the failing test, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
