### Bug Analysis:
The bug is in the way the `equals` function is comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It is currently sorting the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which leads to incorrect results in cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in how it constructs the tuple to be used for sorting the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function only considers the block's dtype name and the locations (`mgr_locs`). In cases where two blocks have the same data but different locations, they will be sorted differently, leading to a false positive in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data elements, not just the dtype name and locations. This ensures that blocks with the same data are considered equal even if their locations differ.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block's data elements
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data values in addition to dtype name and locations, the function will now correctly compare blocks based on their actual data elements rather than just their properties. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
