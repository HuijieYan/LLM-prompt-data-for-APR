### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two `BlockManager` objects. The function checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`. However, the comparison of blocks is done using a custom sorting function `canonicalize` based on the block dtype and `mgr_locs`. In case where the blocks have identical content but different locations (for example, if blocks were flipped), the function incorrectly returns `True` because different locations change the order of blocks after sorting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on sorting by block dtype and `mgr_locs`, we should compare block content directly. This change will ensure that blocks with identical content are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the blocks directly without considering their sorting order. This change will resolve the issue and the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
