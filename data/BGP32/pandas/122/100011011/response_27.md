### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block within them based on their type and locations.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The runtime values and types of variables provided show that the function is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks, leading to the incorrect comparison result.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the expected output should be `False`.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic of the blocks. We need to ensure that the comparison accounts for the block type and locations correctly.
2. By inspecting the `canonicalize` function, we can see that it combines the block's type name and manager locations.
3. We should update the comparison logic to compare based on these tuples of type name and locations for correct identification.
4. By refining the comparison logic and considering the block's type and locations in the sorting process, we can resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Combine block type and locations for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the combined tuple of type name and manager locations, the corrected function will accurately compare the `BlockManager` objects and reflect the expected behavior as per the GitHub issue.
