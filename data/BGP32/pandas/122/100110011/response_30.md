### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas.tests.internals.test_internals` module checks if two dataframes are considered equal when they are not.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with the message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. The GitHub issue title and description align with the failing test and the behavior of the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method arises from the incorrect comparison logic of the DataFrame blocks. The method attempts to compare blocks based on type name and location, but the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to improve the comparison logic when sorting and comparing blocks in the `equals` method. We need to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared to determine if two DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Use type name instead of block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By utilizing the `type(block).__name__` instead of `block.dtype.name` for canonicalization, we can compare the blocks more accurately. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
