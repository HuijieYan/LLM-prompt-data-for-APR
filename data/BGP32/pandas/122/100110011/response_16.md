### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file is supposed to compare two objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in a different order and expects the `equals` function to return False, but it fails.
- The error message shows that the comparison returned True instead of False, leading to an assertion error.
- The GitHub issue confirms that there is a bug in the `equals` method when dealing with identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the way DataFrame blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` function.
- When sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, the comparison is not considering the order of columns in the DataFrames.
- This leads to identical blocks being compared incorrectly and the `equals` function returning True when it should return False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the order of columns while sorting the blocks.
- We should modify the sorting condition to include column order information to ensure correct comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.columns.tolist(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Fix to include column order

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the column order information in sorting the blocks, we ensure that identical blocks with different column orders are correctly distinguished. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
