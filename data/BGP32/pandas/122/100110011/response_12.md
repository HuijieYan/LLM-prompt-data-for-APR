### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in `managers.py` in the pandas library is supposed to compare two data structures and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects them to be unequal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, indicating that the `equals()` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue reported confirms the incorrect behavior of the `equals()` function and provides a reproducible example.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals()` function not handling the comparison of DataFrames correctly. Since the internal block ordering in the DataFrames is different, the function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to consider the internal block ordering while comparing the DataFrames. By ensuring that the comparison is done correctly based on the block structure, we can address the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_block_manager()._consolidate_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the DataFrames will be compared correctly, taking into consideration the internal block ordering. This change should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
