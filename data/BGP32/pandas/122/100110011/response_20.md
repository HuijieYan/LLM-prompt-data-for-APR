### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is meant to compare two objects and determine if they are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in the columns and expects the `equals` function to return `False`, but the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the observed behavior causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is introduced due to not handling the comparison of values correctly when the two DataFrames have different values in corresponding positions. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function checks for the equality of values at corresponding positions in the two DataFrames correctly. This can be achieved by comparing the values directly instead of the blocks, which are sorted based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the shape of the two DataFrames is different
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    
    # Check equality for each element in the two DataFrames
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version:
- We first ensure that the shapes of the two DataFrames are equal. If not, we return `False`.
- Then, we iterate over each column and check if the values in corresponding positions are equal. If any values are not equal, we return `False`.
- If all checks pass, we return `True` indicating that the two DataFrames are equal.
