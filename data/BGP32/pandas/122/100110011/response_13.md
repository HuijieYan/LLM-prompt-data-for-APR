### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas is not correctly comparing two DataFrames for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file is comparing two DataFrames with different values, expecting them to be unequal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion expects `True` to be `False`, indicating that the buggy function is returning `True` incorrectly for equal DataFrames.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method is erroneously returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares blocks. The bug is in the `canonicalize` function where it sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. When two DataFrames have different values but same block order, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values in the blocks for comparison. We should sort the blocks based on their values rather than just their metadata.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the corrected version of the `equals` function, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
