### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is not comparing DataFrames correctly. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` is checking the equality of two DataFrames with different values, expecting a `False` result, but the function is incorrectly returning `True`. The GitHub issue related to this bug confirms the wrong behavior observed.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely caused by the way the function compares the blocks of DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple to order blocks, but this can lead to an incorrect comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different values correctly. It uses a combination of the type name and locations of the blocks to sort them, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure correct comparison based on values rather than block type and locations. By updating the comparison logic in the `equals` function, we can ensure that DataFrames with different values are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare DataFrames based on their values and return the expected result for the failing test.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now perform the DataFrame comparison correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
