### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function is supposed to check if two `DataFrame` objects are equal or not based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` where the values of the columns are interchanged.
- When the buggy `equals` function is used to compare these two `DataFrame` objects, it incorrectly returns `True`.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`. This reveals a bug in the `equals` function.
- The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for non-equal dataframes.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrect comparison logic when sorting and comparing blocks in the dataframes.
- The current comparison logic does not take into account the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, which can result in false positives when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks in the sorting key.
- This will ensure that dataframes with identical blocks but different locations will be treated as not equal.
- By updating the sorting key to include both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, we can achieve a more accurate comparison of dataframe blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Updated key to include mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected `equals` function should now accurately compare dataframes based on their block locations and correctly return `False` for non-equal dataframes.
