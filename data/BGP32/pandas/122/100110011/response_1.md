### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `managers.py` file of pandas core internal has an issue with the `equals` method.
2. The failing test in `test_internals.py` checks if two dataframes are not equal, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning True for the comparison.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is returning True instead of False. This mismatch is due to the buggy behavior of the `equals` method.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not properly handle the comparison between two dataframes. It fails to identify when two dataframes are not equal, leading to a wrong assertion in the test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the dataframes column-wise and row-wise. We need to consider the identifiers of each block to decide if the dataframes are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly identify differences in the dataframes, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
