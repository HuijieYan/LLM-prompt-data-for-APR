### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their dtype names and manager locations.
2. Comparison using the `equals` method on the blocks.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused because the DataFrame `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks with the same data but in a different order. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, causing the comparison to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on the data directly rather than relying on dtype name and manager locations for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

By comparing the block data directly using `np.array_equal`, we ensure that the DataFrame comparison ignores the order of the blocks and focuses on the actual content. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
