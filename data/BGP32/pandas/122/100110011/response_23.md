### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library seems to have a bug that causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file tries to check if two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are not equal due to having columns with swapped values.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison unexpectedly results in `True`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the bug, providing sample code that demonstrates the problem and the expected outcome.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the way the DataFrames are compared in the `equals` function. The comparison uses `ax1.equals(ax2)` to check if all axes are equal, which is incorrect when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of directly comparing the axes, we should consider the blocks themselves and their order. Sorting the blocks based on a unique identifier for each block will ensure a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the unique block identifier
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._get_block_manager_axis(0)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By employing a unique block identifier in the `canonicalize` function and sorting the blocks based on that identifier, the corrected `equals` function will ensure a proper comparison of DataFrames even when blocks have different locations.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
