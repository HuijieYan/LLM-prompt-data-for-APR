### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is supposed to check if two `NDFrame` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects the equality check to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the equality check returned `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.
4. The GitHub issue reports exactly this problem, where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with the same data but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the `managers.py` file fails to account for the case where the columns exist in both DataFrames but with different positions.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To address the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of their locations.
2. We can modify the `canonicalize()` function to compare the block content instead of their positions.
3. Removing the code related to sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize()` and directly comparing block content will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting based on locations, the corrected function will correctly identify DataFrames with the same content but different positions as unequal, resolving the issue.
