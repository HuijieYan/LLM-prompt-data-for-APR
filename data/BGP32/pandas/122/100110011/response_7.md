### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames by checking if their axes are equal and then canonicalizing (sorting) their blocks before comparing them.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, which is correct.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because `assert True is False`, meaning `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly returned True.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug is caused when comparing the DataFrames blocks by their dtype name and manager locations, which can lead to discrepancies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This sorting may lead to identical blocks being considered different due to their locations.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison process for the blocks of the DataFrames. Instead of relying on sorting blocks, we can directly compare them without sorting to ensure accurate comparison results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should accurately compare the DataFrames' blocks without sorting them based on dtype name and locations, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
