### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is supposed to check if two dataframes are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two dataframes with different values and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that `True is False` assertion error occurred.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `equals` method does not handle the case when the columns have different values but could still produce the same sorted output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to properly check for equality based on the values in the dataframes, not just the order of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_values()
    other_blocks = other.get_values()
    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

By using `get_values()` to retrieve the actual values from the dataframes and then comparing those values using `np.array_equal`, we ensure that the equality is based on the values themselves, not just the block order. This should fix the bug and make the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
