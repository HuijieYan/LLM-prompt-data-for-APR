### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is used to compare two DataFrame objects in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is attempting to compare two DataFrames with different values.
3. The corresponding error message indicates that the assertion is failing because `True is False`, which points to an issue in the equality comparison logic.
4. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals()` method when comparing DataFrames with different values.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals()` method arises due to the sorting of blocks in the DataFrames based on their dtype name and locations. This sorting can lead to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with different values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are sorted before comparison. Instead of relying solely on dtype name and locations, we should consider the actual values in the blocks for equality comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting of blocks based on dtype and locations, and directly comparing the blocks using the `equals()` method, we can ensure correct comparison of the DataFrames based on their actual values.

This corrected version of the `equals()` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
