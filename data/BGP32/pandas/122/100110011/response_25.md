### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is expected to compare two dataframes for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is testing for inequality of two dataframes.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with the result `assert True is False`.
4. The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the way the dataframe blocks are being compared. If the blocks have different locations, the current comparison method fails to identify them as unequal leading to an incorrect equality result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on both type name and manager locations. This will ensure that dataframes are considered unequal if the blocks have different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this update to the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expected to pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
