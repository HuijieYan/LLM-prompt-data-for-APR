### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is designed to compare two pandas objects for equality.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if two DataFrames are not equal.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem, where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` function is erroneously returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical data but different block locations.
- This issue arises from sorting the blocks in different orders based on data type and location, causing the comparison to give incorrect results when they should be equal.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the actual data within the blocks and not just their types or locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block._values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block._values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, other_blocks_data[i]) for i, block_data in enumerate(self_blocks_data)
    )
```

This corrected version considers the actual data within the blocks for comparison using `np.array_equal` to ensure equality.
