### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is used to compare two `NDFrame` objects.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is designed to check if two dataframes are equal using the `equals()` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue identifies the problem as `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the logic that sorts and compares the internal blocks of the dataframes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle unconsolidated blocks that have the same content but different locations correctly. As a result, the dataframes are considered equal when they should not be.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals()` function to properly handle unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.nbytes, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

After making these changes, the function should correctly handle the comparison of dataframes with identical blocks but different locations, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
