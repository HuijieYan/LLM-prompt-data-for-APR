### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` compares two DataFrames by iterating over their axes and blocks. The error in the function causes it to return `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values in columns and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because `True` is returned instead of `False` when comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.
4. The GitHub issue `BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations` highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function and provides a code sample that demonstrates the problem.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than location.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals()` function in the original code does not compare blocks based on their content but instead sorts and compares them based on their locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to compare blocks based on their actual content. We can implement this by changing the way we compare blocks within the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to compare blocks based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values  # compare blocks based on their values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now compare blocks based on their content, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
