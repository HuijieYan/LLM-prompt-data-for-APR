### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if two dataframes are not equal using the `df1.equals(df2)` method.
3. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but the buggy function is returning `True`.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The error message specifically shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks in the dataframes does not consider the ordering of the elements within each block correctly. This leads to scenarios where two dataframes may have identical blocks with different locations and still be considered equal by the `equals` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content and order of the elements within each block. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account both the type and the data values of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtypes.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the values and dtypes of the blocks, we ensure that the `equals` method now properly compares the dataframes based on their actual content. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
