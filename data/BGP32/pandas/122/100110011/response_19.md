### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function in `managers.py` is failing to correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py`.
2. The failing test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because `True is False`, suggesting that the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue provides more context on the bug, stating that `DataFrame.equals()` incorrectly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, the canonicalization of block order using dtype name and mgr_locs is likely causing the incorrect equality check between DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison logic inside the `equals` function, particularly in how the blocks of the DataFrames are sorted and checked for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider only the dtype name for sorting blocks.
2. Remove the sorting based on mgr_locs since the issue arises due to blocks having the same dtype but different locations.
3. Refactor the comparison logic to correctly identify differences between DataFrames.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying the above bug fix should address the incorrect equality comparison issue between DataFrames and make the `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
