### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is intended to check for equality between two objects based on their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that when comparing two DataFrames with columns swapped, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of column order in DataFrames.
2. Inconsistent behavior when comparing the DataFrames.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` function does not take into account the order of columns in the DataFrames. When comparing two DataFrames with the same data but different column order, the function incorrectly evaluates them as equal. This behavior contradicts the expected logic of comparing the DataFrames structurally and not just based on the order of values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames based on their data and structure rather than simply checking each block sequentially. One way to achieve this is to sort the columns before comparison. By ensuring that the columns are in the same order during comparison, we can correctly determine equality between the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using sorted columns
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [col for col in sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: x.name)]

    self_cols = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_cols = canonicalize(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_cols, other_cols)
    )
```

By sorting the columns before comparison in the above corrected version of the `equals` function, we ensure that the function accurately evaluates the equality between two DataFrames based on their data structure. This change should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
