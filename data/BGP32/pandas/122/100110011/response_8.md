### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is supposed to compare two objects' equality considering various properties like axes, blocks, and data types. However, the function contains a bug that causes it to return incorrect results. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file tries to compare two DataFrames with different values but the same structure, expecting them to be unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks based on their type name and memory location. When comparing the DataFrames in the failing test, the function considers only the order of the blocks instead of the actual values within the blocks. This leads to incorrect equality checks and causes the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should not rely solely on sorting blocks by type name and memory location for comparison. Instead, it should compare the actual data within the blocks to determine equality correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_result_as_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_result_as_blocks()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
def get_result_as_blocks(self):
    result_blocks = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        result_blocks.append(block.get_values())
    return result_blocks
```

In the corrected version, the `get_result_as_blocks` function is used to extract the actual block values for comparison. This ensures that the equality check is based on the data content, not just the block order. With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
