### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is testing the equality of two DataFrames with different values.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
4. The GitHub issue provides details about the bug where the `equals` method wrongly returns True even if the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` method is caused by comparing blocks in DataFrames without considering their locations. This results in the method wrongly returning True when blocks have different locations but the same values, as demonstrated in the failing test case.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in a way that it considers both values and locations of the blocks when comparing DataFrames. By incorporating the block locations in the comparison logic, we can ensure that DataFrames with the same values but different block locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the comparison of block locations using `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)`, the corrected `equals` method now takes the block positions into account when comparing two DataFrames for equality. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
