### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module is designed to compare two objects and return `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas.tests.internals.test_internals` module creates two DataFrames with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different values. The assertion expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the actual result was `True`, which is incorrect.
4. The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" highlights a similar scenario where `equals` function returns `True` even if the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way block ordering is handled. Due to unconsolidated blocks, the comparison fails to detect the differences effectively.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly distinguish blocks based on their type and locations. This will ensure that the comparison considers the correct properties of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on data type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the updated `canonicalize` function, the `equals` method should now correctly handle comparisons of DataFrame blocks with different locations. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
