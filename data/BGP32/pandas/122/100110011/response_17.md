### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is used to compare two `DataFrame` objects to check if they are equal.
2. The test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, which have different column values.
3. The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True`, which is incorrect.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing different dataframes.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is in the implementation of the `equals` function. It fails to correctly identify the inequality in dataframes due to the sorting mechanism used for comparing blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from the sorting of blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This sorting mechanism may cause the function to return incorrect results when comparing dataframes with different values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the sorting mechanism or the logic of comparing blocks to accurately determine the equality of dataframes regardless of the block order.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting based on block details, the corrected version should now accurately compare the two dataframes provided in the failing test case.
