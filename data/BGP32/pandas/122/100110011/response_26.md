### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `Managers` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test is the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides context on the bug and an expected output of `False`.

### Potential Errors:
1. The issue may lie in the comparison logic within the `equals` method when checking `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the way the `equals` function is comparing DataFrame blocks. It fails to consider the block's location during comparison, resulting in incorrectly marked identical blocks as different due to different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, you should update the comparison logic within the `equals` method to properly account for block locations. Use the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on both type name and manager locations to ensure consistent comparisons regardless of the block's location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.iter_indices()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now properly handle comparisons between DataFrames, taking into account the location of blocks to determine equality.
