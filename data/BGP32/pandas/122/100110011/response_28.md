### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test is the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion failed.
4. The GitHub issue describes the bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is checking the equality of two DataFrames based on their individual blocks without considering the order of elements within those blocks. This leads to False negatives when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return True.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method compares the DataFrames element-wise, considering the order of elements within the blocks. This will prevent False negatives and accurately identify when two DataFrames are not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def elem_equal(elem1, elem2):
        return elem1.equals(elem2)
    
    return all(elem_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will now properly compare DataFrames element-wise, accounting for the order of elements within the blocks. This should resolve the bug described in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
