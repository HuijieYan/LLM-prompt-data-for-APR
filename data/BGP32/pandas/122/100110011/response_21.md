### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is not handling the comparison of DataFrames correctly. The function compares the blocks of the DataFrames without considering the actual values within the blocks, leading to incorrect results.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different data but similar block structures and expects the `equals` function to return `False`. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison fails.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it returns `True` instead. This is due to the faulty comparison logic in the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data values within the blocks of the DataFrames rather than just comparing block attributes.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.equals(other):
        return False
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False

    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

By implementing this corrected version, we compare the actual data values in the DataFrames which will correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal or not. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
