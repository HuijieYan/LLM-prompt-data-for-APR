### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic for self and other axes.
2. The sorting and comparison logic for self and other blocks.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the comparison logic implemented in the `equals` function. When comparing dataframes `df1` and `df2`, the buggy function incorrectly considers them equal, even though the columns in both dataframes have different orders. This is due to the use of sorting logic (by dtype name and mgr_locs) for the blocks before comparison, which leads to false positives in cases where the order of columns is different but the actual data is not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. We should directly compare the data in the blocks without relying on sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This will ensure that the comparison considers the actual data values in the dataframes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs, the corrected version of the function should now compare the blocks directly for equality. This revised logic should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly for comparing dataframes with columns in different orders.
