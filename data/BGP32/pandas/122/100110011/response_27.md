### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames by sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may not ensure the correct comparison.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders to test the equality check, expecting it to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` function does not handle the case where the DataFrames have columns in a different order.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to check for the equality of columns irrespective of their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if set(self.columns) != set(other.columns):  # Check if columns match
        return False
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):  # Check if column values are equal
            return False
    return True
```

By comparing the columns and then iterating over each column to check for equality of values, we ensure a more accurate comparison of DataFrames. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
