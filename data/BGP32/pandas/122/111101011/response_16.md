### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class when comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function sorts and compares the blocks based on their dtype name and the locations within the manager, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method needs to be modified to handle cases where identical blocks might have different locations within the `BlockManager`. One approach is to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content instead of locations
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This updated version compares the blocks based on their content to ensure correct equality comparisons even with identical blocks having different locations.

After implementing the above fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
