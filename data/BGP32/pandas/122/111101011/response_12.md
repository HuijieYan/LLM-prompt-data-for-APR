### Potential Error Locations:

1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be erroneous.
2. Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might be causing the incorrect comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:

The bug occurs because the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not accurately reflect the equality between the two BlockManagers. Additionally, sorting the blocks based on a canonical ordering might not be sufficient for accurate comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Improve the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` to correctly assess the equality.
2. Find a more robust way to compare the blocks in `self` and `other` to ensure the correct identification of equality.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly, without sorting
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, the corrected function can accurately determine the equality between the two BlockManagers.
