### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class aims to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.

### Issues:
1. The bug is occurring because the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly designed to compare blocks. It should compare block data values rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. The comparison between blocks is not properly handling unconsolidated blocks like Categorical in terms of distinguishing them.
3. The faulty design is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual block data values instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. Modify the block comparison logic to appropriately handle unconsolidated blocks for accurate equality checks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            # Change to compare block data values
            return block.get_values()

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the comparison logic to consider block data values, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
