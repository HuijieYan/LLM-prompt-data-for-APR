### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to properly compare blocks within the `BlockManager`. The comparison logic is flawed in the case where blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than the location. Before comparing the blocks, they should be sorted based on their content. We can achieve this by creating a function to canonicalize the blocks using their data type and content.

### Code Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtype.name)  # Canonicalize based on values and dtype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content before comparing, thus resolving the issue with equality checking when blocks have the same content but different locations. The corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
