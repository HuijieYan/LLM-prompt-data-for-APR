### Issue Analysis
- The bug is present in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, where it incorrectly returns `True` in cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.
- The bug is identified through the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with the same data but different column order are incorrectly identified as equal.
- The runtime values and types of the variables inside the `equals` function show the comparison logic that doesn't take into account the block locations.
- The GitHub issue confirms the misbehavior of the function when comparing DataFrames with different block locations.

### Bug Explanation
- The comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is done based on their content but without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
- The sorting of blocks based on type and manager locations can potentially resolve the issue of inconsistent block ordering.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison of blocks between DataFrames considers both the block content and block locations.
- Modify the `equals` function to sort the blocks based on a combination of type and manager locations before the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both type and manager locations before the comparison, we ensure that the block comparison in the `equals` function accounts for potential differences in block positions and corrects the issue identified in the failing test and GitHub report.
