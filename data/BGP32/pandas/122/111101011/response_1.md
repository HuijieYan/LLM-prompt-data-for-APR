### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of the axes of `self` and `other`.
2. Sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` arrays without considering unconsolidated blocks.
3. Canonicalizing the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the difference in block order when comparing two DataFrames due to unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical data) that are not considered when sorting. This leads to misleading equal comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block sorting process to consider the unconsolidated blocks. This can be done by adding logic to account for the unconsolidated blocks, ensuring they are handled correctly during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Compare block count
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort blocks with consideration for unconsolidated blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            if not block.is_consolidated():
                return (block.items, block.mgr_locs)
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version includes logic to handle unconsolidated blocks properly during sorting, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly marked as not equal.
