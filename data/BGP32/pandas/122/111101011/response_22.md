### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames, which internally use `BlockManager`, and expects `False` as the output, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises when identical blocks have different locations, which is not properly handled by the current implementation of the `equals` function.
2. Identical blocks with distinct locations were not considered when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, leading to `True` being returned incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations when comparing blocks for equality.
2. Update the comparison logic to account for identical blocks with different positions to prevent false positives.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, now considering block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issue mentioned in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` related to identical blocks with different locations.
