### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function mistakenly compares the axes but fails to compare the actual blocks in the correct order.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns swapped and expects the `equals` function to return `False`, but due to the incorrect comparison in the function, it returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks before comparison based on block type and location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function (which considers block type and location), we ensure the correct order of comparison. This should now correctly handle cases where blocks are identical but with different locations, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
