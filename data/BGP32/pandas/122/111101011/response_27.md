### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The runtime values of the input parameters and variables show that the function compares axes correctly but fails to handle identical blocks with different locations.
4. Based on the failing test and runtime values, the bug lies in the comparison of blocks and how they are sorted before comparison.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. When sorting blocks based on `canonicalize` function, the `mgr_locs` is not correctly considered, leading to incorrect comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` in the sorting order to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering mgr_locs for identical blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function for sorting blocks, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
