### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations but with the same content. This leads to incorrect equality check results due to the comparison method used. The function compares the blocks by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, which are not suitable for distinguishing blocks that have the same content but different positions.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we should change the block comparison logic to focus on the block content and structure rather than the block location. By updating the comparison criteria, we can ensure that the `equals` function properly checks if the blocks contain the same data regardless of where they are located.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the block content directly using the `values` attribute instead of relying on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to ensure accurate equality checks.
