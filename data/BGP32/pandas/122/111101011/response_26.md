### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames where the blocks have identical contents but different locations. This issue arises because the function is not considering the block locations when comparing the blocks, leading to false positives in equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the equality comparison in the `equals` function to take into account the block locations when comparing the blocks. By ensuring that the comparison considers both the content and the location of the blocks, we can accurately determine equality between two DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function now considers the block locations in the comparison, ensuring that DataFrames with identical block contents but different block locations are correctly detected as unequal. Running the failing test provided should now pass successfully.
