### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `BlockManager.equals()` function because it incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates them in place, compares the number of blocks, and finally compares the blocks themselves by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations. However, the comparison of the blocks can fail when blocks have identical data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `BlockManager.equals()` function, we can modify the way it compares the blocks to account for cases where blocks have the same data but different locations. One approach would be to directly compare the block data instead of sorting them based on type and location.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, the function will properly handle cases where blocks have identical data but different locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
