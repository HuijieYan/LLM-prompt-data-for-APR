### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The current implementation is flawed as it erroneously returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Identification:
1. The comparison of axes `self_axes` and `other_axes` seems correct.
2. The consolidation of `self` and `other` instances is done using `_consolidate_inplace`, which should not affect the comparison.
3. The comparison of the number of blocks in `self` and `other` objects may lead to early returns if they are unequal, but it doesn't address the bug.
4. The critical part that has the bug is when comparing the blocks. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks is based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The bug arises from the fact that `mgr_locs` is not directly comparable between blocks that are technically the same but located differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation arises from the inadequate handling of blocks with the same content but different locations within `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based solely on their content rather than on their locations, which are not relevant to the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new canonicalize function to compare blocks by content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their content, we ensure that identical blocks will be correctly identified as equal, regardless of their location within the `BlockManager` instances.
