### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances by their types and manager locations. However, there is a bug causing it to return `True` incorrectly in cases where the blocks have identical contents but different locations.

The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. If the axes are not identical, it returns `False`. Then, it consolidates the blocks in both instances. The bug arises when comparing the sorted blocks by their type name and manager locations. This comparison can lead to incorrect results when blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused due to comparing the blocks based on their type name and manager locations even when the blocks have the same data content but different locations.
2. There is no consideration for the actual data within the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks rather than sorting and comparing them by their type name and locations. This will ensure that identical content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected function now compares the blocks by iterating through them and checking if they are equal. This approach ensures that the data within the blocks is accurately compared for equality. This fix should allow the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to pass and resolve the issue on GitHub.
