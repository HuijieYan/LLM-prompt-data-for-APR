## Identified issue:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to properly handle cases where blocks with the same data have different locations, leading to incorrect results.

## Explanation of the bug:
1. The function starts by comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. If the lengths of the axes are different, it correctly returns False.
2. Next, it checks if each pair of axes is equal. If any pair is not equal, it returns False.
3. The function then calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both `self` and `other`, potentially modifying the internal representation of the blocks.
4. It then compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, it correctly returns False.
5. The bug lies in the block comparison logic. It advances to canonicalize the blocks by sorting them based on type name and location, but it fails to handle cases where blocks with the same data have different locations.
6. Therefore, when comparing the sorted blocks in the final step, it may wrongly conclude that two `BlockManager` instances are equal even though their blocks have different locations.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to update the block comparison logic to consider not only the block data but also the block locations. One approach is to compare the block data only if the block dtype and mgr_locs are matching.

## Revised buggy function with the bug fixed:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The revised function now includes a `canonicalize` function that creates a tuple of dtype name and locations for each block. This tuple is used for sorting the blocks before comparison, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where blocks have the same data but different locations and return the correct result as expected.
