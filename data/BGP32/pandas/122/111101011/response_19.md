### Bug Analysis:
- **Issue:** The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
- **Error Location:** The issue stems from the comparison logic within the `equals` function that does not account for the block locations in addition to the block content.
- **Explanation:** The function sorts the blocks based on their content but does not consider the order of the blocks. This results in scenarios where the blocks may be identical in content but stored in different locations, leading to a false positive result.
- **Strategy for Fixing:** The fix involves augmenting the comparison logic to include the location information of the blocks in addition to the content.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Existing function definitions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        # New logic to compare both blocks and locations
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the updated comparison logic, the corrected version of the `equals` function now considers both the block content and their locations when determining equality, addressing the bug highlighted in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
