The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is failing because the block order is not consistent, leading to incorrect results. The issue posted on GitHub highlights this problem, where the `equals` function returns `True` even when blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the block order is consistent when comparing between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sort the blocks based on a canonical ordering that considers both the type name and the location of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a canonicalization function to sort blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks in a consistent manner using the `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and manager locations, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should make the failing test pass.
