### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their internal blocks. The bug arises when trying to compare blocks with identical content but different locations due to unconsolidated blocks.

1. In the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` objects are created with columns 'a' and 'b', but the values within these columns are swapped between the two dataframes. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False since the data values are different, but the buggy function is erroneously returning True.

2. The `equals` function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. If the lengths and contents of the axes are the same, it proceeds to compare the blocks. In the block comparison section, the bug arises when trying to compare unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug:

The bug occurs due to the block comparison method not taking into account unconsolidated blocks in terms of their location, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to update the block comparison approach to consider unconsolidated blocks correctly. One possible strategy is to ensure that during sorting of the blocks, we prioritize content comparison over location comparison. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on content rather than the block's location.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on content and dtype rather than location, we ensure correct comparison of unconsolidated blocks. This correction should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected in the failing test case.
