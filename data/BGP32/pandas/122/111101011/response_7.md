### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations, but it mistakenly uses `as_array.tolist()` to get the locations, which results in incorrect comparison values.

The `BlockPlacement` object contains the location information, but it should be accessed using `block.mgr_locs.labels.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

The incorrect comparison of block locations causes the `equals` function to return True for two `BlockManager` instances that should be considered different due to the block location differences.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method to use `block.mgr_locs.labels.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to get the correct block location information.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to correctly compare the sorted blocks based on data type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.labels.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this correction, the `equals` function will now properly compare `BlockManager` instances based on sorted block data type and locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
