### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks in different locations but with the same content. The current implementation sorts the blocks by their type name and location, which leads to incorrect results when the blocks are the same but in different locations.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `equals` sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and block location. This leads to blocks being considered different even if they have the same content.
2. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` for cases where the blocks have the same content but are located differently in the DataFrame.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process of the blocks. Instead of sorting and comparing based on type and location, we should compare the content of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we removed the sorting mechanism based on type and location and directly compare the content of the blocks. This change ensures that blocks with the same content are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their location.

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected result of `False` for cases where the blocks have the same content but are located differently, as demonstrated in the failing test case.
