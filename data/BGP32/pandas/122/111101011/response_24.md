### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations. The buggy function fails to identify this scenario and incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes length without considering the elements.
2. Failure to properly handle blocks with identical data but located differently.
3. Sorting of blocks based on a misleading key when identifying block equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the `equals` function considering the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` for comparison instead of the actual elements in the axes. This leads to the function reaching the block comparison stage, where blocks are sorted based on a canonicalization method that can mislead the comparison process when blocks have identical data but are located differently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the comparison of axes to include the elements for accurate comparison.
2. Enhance block comparison logic to account for identical blocks located differently.
3. Adjust sorting method for blocks to accurately identify block equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check each block for equality by comparing data and locations
    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock) and block.items.equals(oblock.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.items, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.items, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By revising the comparison of axes, enhancing the block comparison logic, and adjusting the sorting method for blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should accurately identify the equality of DataFrames, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
