## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their attributes and blocks' content.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides two DataFrames with columns swapped, expecting `equals` method to return False.
3. The bug arises due to the comparison logic in the buggy function. It does not account for the order of blocks within the BlockManager, leading to incorrect equality check results.
4. The GitHub issue raised reflects the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method in the case when blocks have identical content but are positioned differently.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic within the `equals` method to consider the order of blocks during the equality check.
2. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them.

## Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values_hash())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing `values_hash()` method (assuming it exists in the `Block` class) to generate a unique identifier for block values and utilizing `type(block).__name__` for block type comparison, we can ensure that blocks are correctly ordered during the comparison.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test provided.
