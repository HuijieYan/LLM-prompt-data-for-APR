### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their internal blocks.
2. The issue arises due to the comparison of blocks in different orders. The function sorts the blocks in a specific order but does not consider the order of the elements within each block.
3. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same blocks but in a different order, leading to a false negative result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the issue:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to also sort the values within each block before comparison.
2. Update the return statement to compare each block along with its values in the correct order.

### Bug-fixed function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks using type name and sorted values within each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the updated `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks correctly, the `equals` method should return the expected result, marking the bug as fixed.
