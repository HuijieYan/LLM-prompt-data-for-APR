### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from the comparison logic of the blocks within the `equals` method. The function compares the blocks based on their order, which can lead to incorrect equality results when blocks have the same content but different locations. This discrepancy causes the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue and correct the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` method. Instead of comparing the blocks based on their order, we should compare the blocks based on their content. This adjustment will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks content, not order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their content rather than their order, the corrected version of the `equals` method ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations will be correctly identified as unequal. This revision resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
