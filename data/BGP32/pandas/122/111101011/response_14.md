### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them and comparing the number of blocks as well as the blocks themselves. However, the issue arises because the code does not account for the fact that blocks can be identical but have different locations, leading to a false equality result.

### Fix Strategy

To address this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider identical blocks with potentially different locations as equal. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks based on the block content without considering the specific locations within the manager.

### Corrected Version

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Extract block values for comparison
    self_block_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        any((np.array_equal(block, oblock) for oblock in other_block_values))
        for block in self_block_values
    )
```

This corrected version avoids false positives by checking if any block in `self` matches (in terms of content) with any block in `other`, irrespective of their locations within the manager.

By implementing this change, the `equals` function should provide correct results for comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
