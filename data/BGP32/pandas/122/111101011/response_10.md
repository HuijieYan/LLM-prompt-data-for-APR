### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and a canonicalized order of blocks. The bug causes the function to return True incorrectly in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the comparison logic of `equals` function where it compares the blocks by sorting them using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting may not consider blocks with identical content but different locations as non-equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the sorting of blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` doesn't differentiate blocks that may have the same content but different locations. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional properties of the blocks that can uniquely identify them. This way, the function can correctly distinguish between blocks with the same content but different locations.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version includes the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function to uniquely identify blocks based on their content, ensuring correct comparison results. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test provided.
