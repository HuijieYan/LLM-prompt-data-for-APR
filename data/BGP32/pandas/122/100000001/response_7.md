### Analyzing the buggy function:

The function `equals()` is comparing two objects (`self` and `other`) by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal. However, there seems to be a bug in the sorting of the blocks before comparison.

### Potential error locations:
1. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.
2. Comparing the blocks after sorting.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug may arise from incorrect sorting of blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values. If the sorting is incorrect, the comparison of blocks may not yield the correct result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the sorting of blocks is correctly done before comparison. Check if the `canonicalize` function is correctly defining the sorting criteria for blocks.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function correctly defines how to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The sorted blocks are then compared for equality.
