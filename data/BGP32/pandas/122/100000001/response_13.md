## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is a method called `equals` within the class definition in the `pandas` library. This method is used to compare two internal data structures, specifically the `self` object and the `other` object. The function checks if the axes, blocks, and block data within the two objects are equal.

## Potential error locations
1. The function iterates over the `self_axes` and `other_axes` to check for equality, but the comparison is done based on the `equals` method. If there is a bug or inconsistent implementation in the `equals` method, it could lead to incorrect comparison results.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function can lead to misalignment of blocks.

## Cause of the bug
The bug could be due to inconsistencies in the `equals` method implementation for the data structures being compared. Additionally, the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function might result in misalignment of blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the `equals` method for the various data structures is correctly implemented and handles all edge cases appropriately.
2. Verify that the `canonicalize` function accurately represents the blocks for proper sorting.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to use `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` as a tuple to uniquely identify blocks for sorting. Additionally, ensure that the `equals` method for the respective data structures within the blocks is correctly implemented.
