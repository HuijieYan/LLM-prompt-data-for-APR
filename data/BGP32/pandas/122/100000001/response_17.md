## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two objects are equal based on certain conditions. The function compares different attributes of the objects, such as axes and blocks, for equality. The potential error locations in the code include the comparison of axes lengths, comparison of axes using `equals` method, and sorting of blocks. 

## Bug:
The bug in the code lies in the comparison of axes using the `equals` method in the line:
`if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):`

The issue is that the `equals` method is being used directly without checking if both axes are not None. This can lead to an AttributeError if any of the axes are None, as the `equals` method is called directly on them.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that both `ax1` and `ax2` are not None before calling the `equals` method on them. We can use an additional condition to check if both axes exist before comparing them. 

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1 is not None and ax2 is not None and ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, we have added an additional check to ensure that both axes are not None before comparing them using the `equals` method. This prevents any AttributeError that may occur due to None values while comparing.
