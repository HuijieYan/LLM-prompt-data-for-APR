## Analysis:
The buggy function is checking for equality between two internal managers (`self` and `other`) based on their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the number of axes in both managers is equal. Then it compares each axis in the managers. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks within the managers.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function attempts to call `equals` on each axis which might not be implemented correctly causing unexpected behavior.
2. Sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function could lead to an incorrect comparison if the `canonicalize` function is not sorting the blocks correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function could be caused by incorrect implementation of the `equals` method on the axes or the `canonicalize` function not sorting the blocks correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify the implementation of the `equals` method on axes to ensure correct comparison.
2. Check the `canonicalize` function to make sure it correctly sorts the blocks in a consistent manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block._mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `_values` instead of `dtype.name` to sort the blocks. This change should provide a more accurate comparison between blocks when sorting.
