## The buggy function analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is intended to check if two DataFrame objects are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and blocks' contents. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function that could cause issues:

1. The function is trying to compare the equality of two objects' axes, but it doesn't handle the case where the axes are not of the same length. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
2. The function sorts and compares the blocks within the DataFrame objects based on their data types and locations. If the DataFrame objects contain unconsolidated blocks (such as Categorical data), the comparison might fail as it doesn't account for this scenario.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation of the `equals()` function lies in the fact that it doesn't handle cases where the DataFrame objects have different numbers of axes or unconsolidated blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals()` function, we need to:
1. Check if the lengths of the axes of the two DataFrame objects are the same before proceeding with the comparison.
2. Update the sorting and comparison logic to handle unconsolidated blocks properly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if the lengths of the axes are equal before proceeding with individual comparisons. We then iterate through each axis, block, and block content to ensure a proper equality check. Additionally, we update the block canonicalization logic to use the class name for comparison.
