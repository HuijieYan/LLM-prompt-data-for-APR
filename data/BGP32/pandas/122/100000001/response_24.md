## Bug analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block elements are equal. However, there is a bug in the function that can cause incorrect results. The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The bug is caused by the use of `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function without considering its role in distinguishing unconsolidated blocks. This can lead to incorrect comparison results between two objects.

## Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled correctly, considering the difference in `mgr_locs`. We should use a more robust approach to create a unique identifier for each block that takes into account all necessary information for accurate comparison.

## Corrected version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `canonicalize` function now creates a unique identifier for each block by combining `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`. This modification should ensure correct comparison results for the blocks.
