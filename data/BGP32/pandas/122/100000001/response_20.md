### Analysis:
This buggy function compares two objects based on their axes, blocks, and data content. It aims to determine if the two objects are equal. The bug could potentially arise from the comparison of axes, blocks, or data content.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axes may not be accurate.
2. The consolidation of axes and blocks may cause inconsistency.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks might not be correctly implemented.
4. The equality check between blocks could have errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could be due to inconsistencies in comparing and sorting axes and blocks. If the axes are not properly aligned or if the blocks are not organized correctly, the function may erroneously return False even for equal objects.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Ensure that axes are compared accurately.
2. Verify that the consolidation of axes and blocks does not introduce errors.
3. Check if sorting and comparison of blocks are correctly implemented.
4. Validate the equality check between blocks to accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Improved the canonicalization function to include `block.values.tobytes()` for precise comparison.
2. Simplified the sorting method to ensure correct alignment of blocks.
3. Retained the comparison of blocks for equality check.

These changes aim to address potential issues in comparing axes, blocks, and data content, ensuring a more reliable equality check.
