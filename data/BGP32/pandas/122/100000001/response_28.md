## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is supposed to compare two instances and return True if they are equal, False otherwise. The function compares the axes, blocks, and block content of the two instances for equality.

## Potential error locations:
1. The function may have an error in comparing the blocks of self and other instances.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function before comparing may lead to incorrect comparisons.
3. There might be issues with the way the `equals` method is implemented for blocks.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function could arise from incorrect comparison of blocks due to the sorting that happens before the comparison. If the blocks are not sorted correctly, the equality check might fail, even if the blocks are the same.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are compared correctly without affecting their order. We should also make sure that the equality checks are done accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we removed the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function before comparison. We directly compare the blocks and oblocks without sorting. This should help in accurately determining the equality of the two instances.
