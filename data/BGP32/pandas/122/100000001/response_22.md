The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This function is intended to compare two internal data manager objects to check for equality based on various criteria.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking if they are None.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without handling possible None values.
3. Using the `equals` method within the comparison loop which might have its own bugs.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might occur when the `self_axes` or `other_axes` are `None`, leading to an error when trying to access their length. Additionally, if any of the blocks within `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are `None`, sorting them will also lead to errors. Lastly, the `equals` method used in the final comparison loop could have its own bugs causing incorrect equality checks.

#### Suggested Strategy:
1. Check for None values in `self_axes` and `other_axes` before comparing lengths.
2. Handle None values in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before sorting.
3. Validate the `equals` method being used for correct equality checks.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes is None or other.axes is None:
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if self.blocks is None or other.blocks is None:
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = [block for block in self.blocks if block is not None]
    other_blocks = [block for block in other.blocks if block is not None]
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

In the corrected version, I have added checks for None values in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before sorting them. Additionally, I have included additional checks to ensure that the lengths of the blocks are equal after excluding any None values. Finally, I have modified the final comparison loop to validate the equality of each block pair before returning the overall result.
