## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two objects of the same class. 
2. It checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same, then compares each axis, consolidates both objects, and finally compares the blocks within the objects after sorting them based on certain criteria.

## Bug Identified:
The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. The issue is with the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` where it tries to access `mgr_locs` attribute on `block`, which may not exist causing an AttributeError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to access the `mgr_locs` attribute directly on `block` without considering that not all blocks may have this attribute. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access `mgr_locs` on a block that does not have this attribute.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that accounts for blocks that do not have the `mgr_locs` attribute. We can add a conditional check to handle cases where `mgr_locs` does not exist on the block.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs'):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, [])

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we added a check using `hasattr` to determine if the `block` object has the `mgr_locs` attribute before trying to access it. If the attribute does not exist, we return an empty list as a fallback. This modification ensures that the function can handle blocks without the `mgr_locs` attribute and prevent the `AttributeError`.
