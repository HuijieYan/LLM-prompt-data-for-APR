### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two internal data structures (self and other) for equality.
- It first compares the axes of the two data structures and then the blocks within the structures.
- The key potential error locations are:
  - Mistake in comparing axis lengths of self and other.
  - Incorrect consolidation of the internal data structures.
  - Sorting and comparing the internal blocks based on dtype name and manager locations.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug in this function may occur due to the incorrect comparison of the lengths of axes from both internal data structures (self and other).
- If the lengths of axes are not equal, the function returns False and terminates without performing any additional checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the lengths of axes for both internal data structures are checked correctly before proceeding further.
- Implement proper consolidation of the internal data structures to avoid any inconsistencies.
- Fix the sorting and comparison of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Correction:
- The corrected version of the function addresses the potential error locations and fixes the bug of incorrect axis length comparison.
- It ensures that both internal data structures are properly consolidated before comparing their blocks.
- The function now sorts and compares internal blocks based on dtype name and manager locations for consistency.
