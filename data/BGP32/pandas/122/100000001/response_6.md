## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two instances are equal based on their axes and blocks. The function first compares the lengths of axes, then checks if all axes are equal using the `equals` method, and finally compares the blocks.

## Potential Errors:
1. The `equals` method might not be implemented correctly in the class for axes comparison.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function might not consider all possible variations in block types.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug might occur due to incorrect implementation of the `equals` method for axes comparison or due to sorting blocks without considering all aspects that distinguish them.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the `equals` method is correctly implemented in the class for axes comparison.
2. Enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider all aspects that can distinguish blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Updated to consider block types

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
