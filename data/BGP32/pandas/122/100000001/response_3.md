### Analyzing the buggy function:
The `equals` function is intended to compare two internal data structures (self and other) for equality. The function first checks if the lengths of the self and other axes are not equal, it returns False. Then, it compares the axes of self and other using a generator expression. After that, it consolidates both the self and other data structures in place. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks of self and other based on a canonicalization function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes lengths.
2. Comparison of axes using the `equals` method.
3. Consolidation of self and other data structures.
4. Sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug could potentially arise from the incorrect comparison of axes. If the axes comparison is not performed correctly or if the consolidation of the data structures is not done properly, it could lead to inaccurate equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes are properly compared, and the data structures are consolidated accurately before comparing the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I changed the alignment condition from "all" operation to "any" operation, this will ensure the correct comparison of axes. Additionally, I have retained the rest of the logic to correctly consolidate and compare the data structures' blocks.
