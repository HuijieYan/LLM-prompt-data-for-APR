Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The function does not handle cases where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may cause incorrect comparisons if the blocks are not properly sorted.
3. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but there might be issues with the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` part.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` due to issues with sorting and handling empty blocks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle cases where either `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly sort the blocks based on a criteria that accurately represents their equality.
3. Implement error checks or adjustments to ensure correct block comparison.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:  # Handle cases where either blocks list is empty
        return self.blocks == other.blocks
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By implementing the suggested modifications, the function should now handle empty blocks, sort blocks properly for comparison, and improve the accuracy of block equality checks.
