## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is meant to compare two objects (self and other) for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks for equality. The bug seems to be in the consolidation step where the function `_consolidate_inplace()` is called on both self and other objects.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Calling `_consolidate_inplace()` before comparing blocks might alter the internal state of the objects and affect the comparison.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function without ensuring consistent order may lead to mismatched comparison.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling `_consolidate_inplace()` before comparing the blocks. This leads to potential inconsistencies in the blocks, affecting the equality comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should move the consolidation step to the end, after comparing blocks for equality. This ensures that the objects are compared in their original state before any consolidation is applied.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks for equality before consolidating
    if not all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ):
        return False

    # Consolidate inplace after comparing blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    return True
```
