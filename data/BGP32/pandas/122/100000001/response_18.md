## Analysis:
The buggy function is comparing two objects using the `equals` method. The function compares the axes of the two objects, consolidates them, and then compares the blocks. The issue appears to be in the comparison of the blocks since the sorting is based on a custom function that may not handle all cases correctly.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not handle all block types correctly.
2. Comparison of blocks using the `equals` method may not work as intended.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may arise from the custom `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. If this function does not properly handle all block types, the comparison of blocks may not be accurate.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `canonicalize` function correctly handles all block types.
2. If necessary, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly distinguish between different block types.
3. Ensure that the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method is accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on block type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return type(block).__name__

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function only uses the block type name for sorting, which should provide a more reliable way of comparing blocks. This approach simplifies the sorting process and avoids potential bugs from handling block locations.
