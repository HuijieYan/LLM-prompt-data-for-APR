## Analysis:
The buggy function compares two instances of a custom data structure for equality. It first checks if the number of axes (axes property) in both instances is equal. If not, it returns False. Then, it compares each axis using the `equals` method of the axes.

The bug in this function arises from the handling of blocks in the custom data structure. It attempts to compare blocks of data by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations. However, due to the nature of different data types (e.g., Categorical) having unconsolidated blocks, the comparison can fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when comparing blocks in the two instances. Since certain data types may have unconsolidated blocks, sorting them based only on type name and manager locations may lead to incorrect comparison results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared. Instead of relying solely on sorting blocks, we should compare them based on their content and structure. By directly comparing the data within each block, we can ensure a more accurate equality comparison.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
