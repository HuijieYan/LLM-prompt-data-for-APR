### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two objects by comparing their axes, blocks, and block attributes. The bug seems to arise when comparing blocks due to the lack of consideration of unconsolidated blocks and their order.

### Identified Bug:
The bug likely arises when comparing unconsolidated blocks that cannot be distinguished solely by their content but also by their iteration order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of unconsolidated blocks in the comparison process, leading to incorrect results when comparing objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the unconsolidated blocks in a way that accounts for their specific characteristics that differentiate them from consolidated blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks considering unconsolidated blocks
    return all(
        block._equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```
