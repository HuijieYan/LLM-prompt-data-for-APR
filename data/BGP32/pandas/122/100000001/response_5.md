## Buggy Function Analysis:
The function provided is meant to check if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the way blocks are compared after sorting them based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs. 

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Sorting the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.
2. Comparison of blocks after sorting.

## Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused due to incorrect handling of sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. If the `canonicalize` function does not accurately represent the blocks, the comparison between the two objects will fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function accurately represents the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.
2. Correctly sort the blocks for comparison.
3. Verify the comparison logic between two objects after sorting.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Fixed to convert mgr_locs to list

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version:
- Added `.tolist()` to `block.mgr_locs.as_array()` for converting mgr_locs to a list.
- Properly sorted the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.
- Ensured accurate comparison between the two objects after sorting.

This should address the bug in the function and ensure correct comparison of the two objects.
