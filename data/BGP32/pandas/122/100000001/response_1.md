## Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to determine if two objects are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block elements. However, there is a logical error in the function that may lead to incorrect results. The function first sorts the blocks of self and other based on their type name and manager locations, and then compares each block element for equality.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the `sorted` function on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may change the original order of blocks, causing a mismatch in the comparison.
2. The `canonicalize` function uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to generate a tuple for sorting. If two blocks have the same dtype.name and mgr_locs, they may be incorrectly considered equal.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from sorting the blocks in the `canonicalize` function without considering the original order of blocks. This sorting may lead to misalignment between corresponding blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` maintains the original order of blocks. Sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs may not be sufficient to determine equality accurately. Instead, we can compare corresponding blocks directly using their indexes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the blocks in `self` and `other` using their indexes and directly compare each block for equality. This approach ensures that the comparison maintains the original order of blocks and accurately determines whether the two objects are equal.
