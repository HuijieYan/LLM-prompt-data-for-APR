## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two objects but there are errors in the logic of the function that could lead to incorrect output.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function is comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, but it's possible that the axes might not be appropriately set or have different lengths leading to a false comparison.
   
2. The function then checks if all elements in `self_axes` are equal to the corresponding elements in `other_axes`. However, the `equals` function may not be implemented correctly for the objects being compared, resulting in a false comparison.
   
3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not be consistent if the `canonicalize` function itself has issues.

4. The function relies on the `equals` method of the `block` objects in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` for comparison, which could be faulty and lead to incorrect results.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect comparison of axes lengths, potentially unreliable comparison of axes elements, sorting issues with `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, and a faulty `equals` method for the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes lengths is accurate and handle cases where the lengths might differ.
   
2. Verify the correctness of the `equals` method for the axes elements comparison.
   
3. Check and correct the `canonicalize` function if it is causing sorting issues.
   
4. If the bug persists after the above steps, verify and potentially correct the `equals` method implementation for the blocks.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
        
    if not all(ax1 is ax2 or (ax1.equals(ax2) if hasattr(ax1, 'equals') else ax1 == ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block is oblock or (block.equals(oblock) if hasattr(block, 'equals') else block == oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have included additional checks for comparing axes elements using `is` comparison and then resort to `equals` comparison if the `equals` method is available. We have also modified the `canonicalize` function to use the class name rather than the dtype name for more reliable sorting. Additionally, the `equals` comparison for the blocks now includes a fallback to `==` comparison if the `equals` method is not available.
