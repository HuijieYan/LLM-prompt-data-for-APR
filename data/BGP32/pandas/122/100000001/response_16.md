## Analysis of the buggy function:

1. The function `equals` is comparing two objects by checking their axes, blocks, and then blocks in a sorted order.
2. The potential error location could be in the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`.
3. The bug in the function can occur when comparing blocks that have not been consolidated properly, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both `self` and `other` objects are fully consolidated before comparing their blocks.

## Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we have added the `_consolidate_inplace()` method calls at the beginning of the function to ensure that both `self` and `other` objects are fully consolidated before any comparison is made. This way, the bug related to unconsolidated blocks causing incorrect results should be fixed.
