The buggy function provided is the `equals` method within the pandas/core/internals/managers.py file. The function is intended to compare two DataFrames for equality. However, the bug lies in the comparison logic that can potentially lead to incorrect comparisons due to a discrepancy in block order.

Potential Error Location:
The bug arises from sorting the blocks of both DataFrames using the `canonicalize` function, which concatenates the dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting could cause inconsistency and mismatch in block order, leading to incorrect comparison results.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the block order is not guaranteed to be the same between the two DataFrames, even if the blocks themselves are equal. This discrepancy in block order can cause equal DataFrames to be incorrectly marked as not equal.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, maintain the original block order of the DataFrames during comparison. Instead of sorting the blocks before comparison, iterate over them without changing the order. This will ensure that blocks are compared in the correct order, preventing false inequality results due to block reordering.

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares blocks in their original order, avoiding the block reordering issue and ensuring accurate DataFrame equality comparisons.
