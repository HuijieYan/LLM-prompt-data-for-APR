## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `Managers` class defined in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to determine if two `Managers` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. The bug is likely causing false negative results when comparing two objects.

## Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the way it handles the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function aims to create a tuple with the name of the block's dtype and the block's location. However, the bug is in the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```
Here, `mgr_locs` is supposed to be accessed as an attribute (`mgr_locs`), but it is instead accessed as a method (`mgr_locs()`).

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way `mgr_locs` is accessed in the `canonicalize` function. We should replace `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` with `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
