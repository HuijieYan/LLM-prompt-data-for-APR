## Analysis of the buggy function
1. The function `equals` is comparing two objects (`self` and `other`) by comparing their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The bug may occur in the comparison of block contents since the function sorts the blocks based on a specific criterion before comparing.
3. The bug may arise if the sorting of blocks is not done correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done in a consistent and accurate manner.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to determine the order. If the sorting criteria do not consistently capture the unique identifier of blocks, the comparison between blocks may lead to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique representation of blocks that is reliable for sorting. One approach is to concatenate the block attributes into a string and use that as the sorting key. This ensures that each block is uniquely identified for comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a concatenated string of block attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return f"{block.dtype.name}_{block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()}"

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function concatenates the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` into a unique string representation for sorting the blocks. This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently based on their attributes for accurate comparison.
