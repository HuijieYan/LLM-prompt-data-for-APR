## Analysis:
1. The function `equals` compares two instances of a class and returns `True` if they are equal. It checks for equality in the axes and blocks of the instances.
2. There are potential error locations in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, and the comparison of individual blocks.
3. The bug in the function lies in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. Sorting based on the tuple created by `canonicalize` function may not be enough to ensure correct order and comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a way that guarantees correct comparison, such as sorting based on block ids or some other unique identifier.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on unique block ids for correct comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
