### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of `axes` are equal between the two objects.
3. Then it compares each axis using the `equals` method of the `Index` class.
4. It consolidates both objects in place.
5. It then compares the lengths of the `blocks` attribute of both objects.
6. Finally, it canonicalizes the blocks based on dtype and manager locations, sorting them for comparison using a helper function `canonicalize`.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation of the `equals` function likely arises from the comparison of `blocks` using the `canonicalize` helper function. The `canonicalize` function does not handle the comparison correctly, leading to incorrect equality checks for blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function should create a consistent and comparable representation of each block for accurate comparison.
2. We need to ensure that the comparison process between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` properly reflects the equality check for all elements. 
3. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the order of blocks to be consistent for accurate equality checking.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now accurately compare the `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks, considering the consistency and order of the blocks for equality checking.
