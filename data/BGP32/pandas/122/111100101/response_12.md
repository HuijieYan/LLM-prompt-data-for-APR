## Analysis:
- The buggy function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
- The function retrieves axes and blocks data from both instances to compare them.
- The comparison relies on the equality of axes and blocks among the two instances.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is based on the order of the blocks, which may not be consistent across different instances, leading to false inequality even when the data is the same.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done based on the content of the blocks rather than their order. We can sort the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks to ensure consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their values before comparing them, ensuring a consistent comparison and fixing the bug.
