### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is that it fails when comparing the blocks within `self` and `other`. The bug is likely occurring because the `canonicalize` function is not properly extracting the necessary information to compare the blocks. The comparison within the `all` function does not yield the expected result due to this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly extracts the needed information for comparing the blocks. We should specifically include the type name and the manager locations of the block in the canonicalization process.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this corrected version, the function should now properly compare the blocks within `self` and `other` and return the expected result for the failing test case.
