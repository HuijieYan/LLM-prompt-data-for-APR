There is a bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs when comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and values. The function fails to compare the blocks properly due to a sorting issue.

### Bug Explanation:
- The function first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
- Then it consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
- After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager`.
- Then it tries to canonicalize and sort the blocks based on the block type and location.
- Finally, it compares the sorted blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

The issue is with the canonicalization and sorting of the blocks. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on a tuple of dtype name and mgr_locs. The bug stems from how the sorting is done and the comparison of blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the canonicalize function to properly create a tuple of dtype name and block locations for each block.
2. Sort the blocks based on the new canonicalization.
3. Perform block comparison after sorting to ensure correct equality check between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and return the expected results for the failing test case.
