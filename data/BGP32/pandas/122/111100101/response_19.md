## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function that creates a tuple using the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not directly accessible as an array, leading to the error.

Additionally, the expected input/output variable types are not consistent with the provided buggy function, which could result in errors in the comparison process.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly access the `mgr_locs` attribute and convert it to a list for comparison. This will ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version accesses `mgr_locs.values.tolist()` to properly compare the blocks. Now, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
