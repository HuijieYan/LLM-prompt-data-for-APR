The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The bug arises in the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. The current implementation does not handle the comparison properly due to the wrong identification of dtype and mgr_locs attributes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype and mgr_locs attributes from the block. We should then use these attributes for sorting and comparison of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, tuple(getattr(block, attr) for attr in ['mgr_locs', 'dtype']))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version extracts the necessary attributes from the block using `getattr` and creates a tuple for sorting and comparison. This way, we ensure that blocks are properly compared based on their dtype and mgr_locs attributes.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
