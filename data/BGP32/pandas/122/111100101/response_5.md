### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares the equality of two instances based on their `axes`, `blocks`, and their internal blocks structure.
2. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function, where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. 
3. The bug likely arises from the `canonicalize` function not handling the case where the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is accessed incorrectly in the function, leading to comparison failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block correctly. This may involve modifying the syntax used to access the `mgr_locs` attribute or ensuring that the attribute is accessed in the appropriate way within the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice(0).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `canonicalize` function now correctly accesses the `slice(0)` from the `mgr_locs` of the block before converting it to a list for comparison. This modification ensures that the block comparison within the `equals` function functions correctly.
