The bug in the provided function `equals` lies in the way it iterates over and compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to properly compare the blocks due to the absence of a key function that can distinguish between different block types and their positions.

### Bug explanation:
- The function `equals` compares the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
- The comparison of the `blocks` is done by sorting them using a `canonicalize` function that combines the block type name and `mgr_locs`.
- The bug occurs when trying to sort the blocks using the `canonicalize` function because of an incorrect attribute access in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug fix strategy:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute from the `block` instance in the `equals` function.
- Handle the case where `block.mgr_locs` is not directly accessible by utilizing appropriate methods or attributes to get the required information for comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs'):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, None)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to handle cases where `mgr_locs` may not be directly accessible, the corrected function should now be able to properly compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
