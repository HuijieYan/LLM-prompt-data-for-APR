The bug in the provided `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is due to not comparing the content of the blocks correctly. The current implementation compares the blocks based on the block type and location, which leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the content of the blocks is different.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be based on the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations. We can achieve this by comparing the values within the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare each block in self.blocks with corresponding block in other.blocks
    for idx, self_block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_blocks[idx]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` by calling the `equals` method on the blocks themselves, which should correctly compare their contents.

With this correction, the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
