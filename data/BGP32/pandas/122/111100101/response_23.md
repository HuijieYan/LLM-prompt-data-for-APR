### Error location
The bug is located in the buggy `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. In this function, there seems to be an issue with comparing and ordering the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug explanation
1. The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` (`self_axes`) is not equal to the number of axes in `other` (`other_axes`). If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is correct.

2. Then it iterates over the axes of both `self` and `other` to check if each axis is equal. If any axis pair is not equal, it returns `False`, which is also correct.

3. The next steps involve consolidating the internal data structures of both `self` and `other` using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.

4. After consolidation, the function checks if the number of blocks in `self` is equal to the number of blocks in `other`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is correct.

5. The bug arises when it tries to compare the individual blocks between `self` and `other`. It sorts the blocks based on their data type name and the manager locations of the blocks. However, the comparison uses the `equals` method on the blocks without properly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute.

6. The `canonicalize` function tries to create a tuple of data type name and manager locations of the blocks. The bug occurs when trying to convert `block.mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. The correct attribute reference should be `block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist()`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the attribute reference to `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function. We should use `block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist()` to properly convert the manager locations to a list for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this correction, the function should now compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances properly and pass the failing test case.
