### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two block managers based on their axes, blocks, and block properties. However, the comparison logic is flawed, as it does not take into account the actual values within the blocks. It only sorts the blocks based on their types and block locations without comparing the contents.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to compare the values within the blocks in addition to their types and locations. We can achieve this by iterating through each block in both managers and comparing the equality of their contents.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block-wise equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block one by one
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now iterates through each block in both `self` and `other` managers, comparing the content equality of each block. If any block does not match, it returns `False`. If all blocks are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the two managers are equal.
