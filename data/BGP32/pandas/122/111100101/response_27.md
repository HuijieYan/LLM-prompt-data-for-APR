There are two bugs in the `equals` function:
1. The function is being defined twice in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The condition `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):` is comparing the axes directly using the `equals` method, which is not applicable in this context.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the values of the blocks within `self` and `other` instead of the axes, which should resolve the issues.
