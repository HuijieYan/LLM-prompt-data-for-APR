The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.dtype.name` is used incorrectly. The `dtype.name` returns the name of the data type in a string format, but it is being compared with `dtype` objects in the `canonicalize` function. This causes the comparison to fail and results in a False return from the function.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the dtype objects directly rather than their names.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype and the mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the `dtype` objects instead of their names in the `canonicalize` function. This modification addresses the bug causing the function to evaluate incorrectly and should now pass the failing test provided.
