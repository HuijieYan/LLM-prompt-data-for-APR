### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` using their axes and blocks. 
- The bug arises when comparing the blocks within the `self` and `other` instances, as the comparison is not considering the actual content of the blocks.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which might not be a reliable way to compare block equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than relying on sorting them based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
- We can directly compare each block within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting them.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing each block within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the corrected version of the function should now be able to correctly determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their content.
