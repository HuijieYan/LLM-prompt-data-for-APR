The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function does not properly check for equality between the blocks in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic between the blocks. Instead of using the `equals` method directly, a custom comparison based on the block content should be implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        pdt.util.testing.assert_blocks_equal(block, oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks within the `BlockManager` instances using the `assert_blocks_equal` function from the `pandas.testing` module, which ensures a proper block-wise comparison.
