## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, where they are sorted and compared pairwise. The bug might arise due to incorrect sorting or comparing blocks.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is that the blocks are being sorted and compared incorrectly. The comparison of blocks should consider the contents of the blocks rather than the order of the blocks. In this case, the function sorts the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the dtype name and mgr_locs of the block. This approach is invalid as the order of blocks does not necessarily determine equality.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of blocks to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their order. One way to achieve this is to directly compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, leading to a more accurate equality check.
