The bug in the provided `equals` function is related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare blocks directly without considering the order and structure of the blocks.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that you compare the blocks based on their type and location. You can achieve this by canonicalizing the blocks before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for (_, block1), (_, block2) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected function will sort the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their locations before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and accurate.

With this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case should pass successfully.
