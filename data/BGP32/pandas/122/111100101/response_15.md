## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking the equality of their attributes. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises due to incorrect sorting of the blocks before comparing them.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs when comparing the blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. If the order of blocks is not consistent between two instances, even if the blocks themselves are equal, the function will return False. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to sort the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances before comparing them. This ensures that the order of blocks is consistent between the instances being compared. By ensuring the blocks are sorted using a canonicalization function before comparison, the equality check will be accurate.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the correction, the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are now sorted before comparison, ensuring consistent order for accurate equality check. The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
