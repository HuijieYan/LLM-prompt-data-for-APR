## Analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug arises from an incorrect comparison of individual blocks due to a sorting issue.

## Bug
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` instances. The comparison is done after sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, `mgr_locs` for `block` is accessed incorrectly as `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, resulting in an AttributeError.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the access to `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function for each block. We should access it directly as `block.mgr_locs`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances based on their data types and block locations. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to pass successfully.
