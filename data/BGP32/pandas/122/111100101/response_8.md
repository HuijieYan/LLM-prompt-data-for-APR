The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks by canonicalizing their order to ensure equality. The bug in the function arises from the comparison of blocks where the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly referencing `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This bug occurs due to the incorrect method call on `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is due to the incorrect method call on `mgr_locs`. The attribute `mgr_locs` in a `Block` object of the `BlockManager` class is an instance of `BlockPlacement`, which doesn't have a method `as_array`. Hence, the call `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function results in an AttributeError which causes the overall function to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to access the correct attributes or methods of `BlockPlacement` to provide the necessary information for canonicalization correctly.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_loc_info = str([(b.start, b.stop, b.step) for b in block.mgr_locs])
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_loc_info)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now constructs a unique representation of `BlockPlacement` objects within blocks to handle the comparison correctly. The new implementation should pass the failing test case provided.
