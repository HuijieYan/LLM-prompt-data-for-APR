### Analysis
- The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
- The bug seems to be related to how blocks are compared and sorted.
- The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns of different types and checks if they are not equal. This test triggers the bug in comparing and sorting blocks of the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks does not handle the case where different data types exist in the blocks (e.g., int64 and object).
- Since the data types are not considered in the canonicalization process, the blocks are not sorted correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type information for the blocks. This way, when sorting the blocks, we consider both the data type and the block identifiers for correct comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the data type, name, and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After fixing the bug with the corrected function, it should pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
