### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is caused by an incorrect comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. The bug arises from the fact that the `canonicalize` function is using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a sort key for the blocks. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is used incorrectly as it does not have an attribute `as_array`, leading to an AttributeError. This error prevents the sorting of blocks and affects the comparison between the two BlockManagers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the usage of `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function. We should ensure that `mgr_locs` is accessed correctly to obtain the information needed for sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code ensures that `mgr_locs` is accessed correctly using `block.mgr_locs.slice` within the `canonicalize` function. This change will enable proper sorting of blocks based on the slice attribute, resolving the AttributeError and fixing the bug in the `equals` method.
