## Analysis:
The buggy function is meant to compare two BlockManager instances by checking their axes, blocks, and block content equality. The issue lies in the comparison logic and the handling of blocks.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two BlockManager instances. The function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. This can lead to incorrect comparisons if the blocks are not in the expected order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the mgr_locs from the block.
2. Properly compare the blocks based on their content, rather than dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks is based on their content and not on dtype names or mgr_locs.
