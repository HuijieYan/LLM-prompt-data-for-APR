The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, consolidates the data in-place, sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, and then compares each block between the two `BlockManager` instances.

The bug in the function is related to the sorting of blocks. The function `canonicalize` is used to define the sorting key for blocks, but there is a mistake in accessing `mgr_locs` as an array in the return statement of the `canonicalize` function. Since `mgr_locs` is an attribute of a block and not a method, it should be accessed directly without calling it as a function.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to access `mgr_locs` directly. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test provided.
