The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison of `block` objects in the `equals` method. The comparison of two blocks using the `equals` method should consider both the data and the index of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data and index of the blocks for comparison. We can achieve this by creating a tuple combining the data and index information of the blocks. Then, we can sort the blocks based on this tuple for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering data and index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now properly compare the blocks based on both data and index information, addressing the bug in the original function. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
