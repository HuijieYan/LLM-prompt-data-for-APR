## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks where the order of blocks with the same data type and different locations causes the function to return an incorrect result.
3. When comparing blocks, the function should consider the data within the blocks and not just rely on the order based on the canonicalization method used.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to enhance the block comparison logic to focus on the actual data within the blocks rather than their order.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.left)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.left)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the sorting of blocks is based on the `left` attribute of the blocks to ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual data enclosed within the blocks rather than their location. This modification addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and should provide the correct comparison result for identical blocks with different locations.
