### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It checks if the length of axes is the same and then proceeds to compare each axes element. It then consolidates the blocks of both instances, sorts them, and finally compares each block element.
2. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of block elements. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks by type name and manager locations, but the comparison is done using the `equals` method, which might not be handling the comparison correctly.
3. The bug causes the `equals()` function to wrongly return `True` when the blocks have different locations but are identical in content. This issue was reported on GitHub with an expected output of `False` but getting `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the content of the blocks, not just their locations.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare block values instead of locations
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison between `block` and `oblock` is based on their values, not just their locations. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies if the blocks contain the same data, regardless of their physical locations within the `BlockManager`.
