### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal between the two `BlockManager` objects, and if not, returns False.
3. It then iterates over the axes and compares them element-wise. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns False.
4. It consolidates the internal data structures of both `BlockManager` objects.
5. It then compares the number of blocks within each `BlockManager` object, and if they are not equal, it returns False.
6. Lastly, it sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` object based on a custom key `canonicalize`, which combines the dtype name and manager locations of the blocks, and then compares each pair of blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. The `mgr_locs` attribute is not being accessed properly to compare the locations of the blocks. This leads to incorrect equality comparison of blocks with the same type but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the values from `mgr_locs` attribute of each block for comparison.
- Ensure that the sorting and comparison process of blocks is based on both dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.blocks)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version extracts the `mgr_locs.blocks` in the `canonicalize` function for proper comparison of block locations. This should resolve the issue of returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
