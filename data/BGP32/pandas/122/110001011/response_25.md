### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks if the length of the axes is the same and if the axes are equal.
3. It then consolidates the blocks and compares the number of blocks. Lastly, it compares each block within the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when the blocks have identical data but different locations.
5. The code sample provided in the GitHub issue demonstrates the unexpected behavior when comparing two DataFrames with the same data but different column orders.
6. The function uses sorting to canonicalize blocks for comparison, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the sorting of blocks based on the type name and location, which causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison should focus on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. Sorting the blocks based on content before comparison can address the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, oblock_content)
        for block_content, oblock_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In the corrected version, blocks are sorted based on their content, ensuring that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations. This addresses the reported bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered unequal.
