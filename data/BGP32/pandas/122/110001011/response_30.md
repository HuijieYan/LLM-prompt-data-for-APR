### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises when the function incorrectly considers two `BlockManager` instances as equal even if their blocks are identical but located differently.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison of axes: There could be an issue in comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sorting and comparison of blocks: Sorting and comparing the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs might not correctly detect the actual differences.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function compares the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which causes it to mistakenly consider two `BlockManager` instances as equal even if their block locations are different, leading to an incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison criteria to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. By comparing the block content directly, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies differences between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    if set(self_blocks) != set(other_blocks):
        return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare the content of the blocks using sets to ensure that the function correctly detects differences between two `BlockManager` instances.
