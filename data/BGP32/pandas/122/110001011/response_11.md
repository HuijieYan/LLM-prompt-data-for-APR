### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. It first compares the axes of both instances, followed by comparing the blocks within them.
2. The bug seems to occur during the comparison of blocks, where it might incorrectly return `True` even if the blocks have different locations.
3. The bug is likely caused by sorting blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. If blocks have the same dtype but different locations, the comparison might be inaccurate.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are properly compared without considering only the dtype and locations.
5. A revised approach could be to compare blocks based on more unique identifiers to avoid incorrect `True` returns.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This revised version directly compares blocks without sorting them, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual block structures rather than their dtype and locations.
