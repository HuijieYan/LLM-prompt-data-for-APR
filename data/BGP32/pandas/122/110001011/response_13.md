### Analysis:
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances, checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and location, which can lead to incorrect results if blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function sorts the blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize` that combines the type name and locations of the blocks.
2. If two blocks have the same content but different locations, they will not be considered equal due to the sorting based on locations.
3. This behavior violates the expected behavior when comparing if two `BlockManager` instances are equal despite the blocks being in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks based on their content only, without considering locations. Sorting and comparing the blocks directly will ensure that identical blocks are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Comparing blocks directly without sorting on locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing blocks directly in the corrected version, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their content. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures the expected behavior when comparing `BlockManager` instances.
