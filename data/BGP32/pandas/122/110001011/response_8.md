### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `equals` function where it compares the blocks. The issue arises when trying to compare identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to sorting the blocks based on the block's type name and manager locations, which can lead to mismatched comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks in a way that ensures identical blocks with different locations are considered as different. This can be achieved by not sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function, which should resolve the issue of wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
