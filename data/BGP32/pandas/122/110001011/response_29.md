### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is checking if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it returns False. Then, it compares each axis element using the `equals` method, consolidates both instances, and finally checks if the blocks are equal.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality, leading to incorrect results as seen in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
1. The issue likely arises in the sorting and comparison of blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug causes `BlockManager.equals` to return True when comparing instances with identical blocks but different locations due to the incorrect order of blocks comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort and compare blocks based on a consistent criterion that includes block values to ensure proper comparison and equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both dtype and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared based on both the dtype name and the actual block values, addressing the issue of mistakenly returning True for equal blocks with different locations.
