### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function checks if the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates them, and finally compares the blocks for equality.
3. The bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations but incorrectly compares them for equality.
4. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between blocks is not accurate when the block locations are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change how the blocks are compared for equality. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we need to compare their contents considering possible location differences.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the contents to handle different block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the block's values (`block.values`) rather than locations for comparison in the `canonicalize` function. This change ensures that the blocks are compared correctly even if they have different locations.
