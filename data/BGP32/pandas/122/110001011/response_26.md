### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function checks if the axes of both instances are equal and if the number of blocks in each instance is the same. It then proceeds to compare the blocks themselves.
3. The bug lies in the comparison of blocks. The original implementation sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but it fails when the blocks are identical but have different locations.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to compare the blocks without changing their order based on `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Cause:
The `equals` function incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations due to the sorting of blocks based on `mgr_locs` without considering block equality.

### Proposed Fix:
I will modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to directly compare each block without sorting based on `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected `equals` function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version eliminates the sorting of blocks and directly compares each block for equality, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
