### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` using `equals` method.
2. Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function which might not properly handle different block locations.
3. Comparison of individual blocks using `equals` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of `BlockManager` objects in the `equals` method. The `equals` method checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` objects are equal, and if the number of blocks are identical. However, the issue arises when comparing individual blocks. The sorting based on `canonicalize` function might not handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, leading to a wrong comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in a way that it properly handles cases where identical blocks might have different locations. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.sort_index(ascending=True).tolist())  # Sort the locations before comparison
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `BlockPlacement` locations are sorted before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is not affected by the different block locations. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
