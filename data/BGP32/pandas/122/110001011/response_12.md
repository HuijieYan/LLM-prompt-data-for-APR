### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, resulting in a false positive.

### Identified issues:
1. The `canonicalize` function is not implemented correctly to account for blocks with different locations.
2. The equality check in `equals` does not handle cases where blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks based solely on their type and manager locations, without considering the actual data within the blocks. This leads to a false positive when blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Fix strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block content for comparison.
2. Update the equality check in `equals` to compare block content instead of relying solely on block type and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining both type and data for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version introduces a comparison based on the actual block data in addition to the block type and manager locations, resolving the false positive comparison issue described in the GitHub bug report.
