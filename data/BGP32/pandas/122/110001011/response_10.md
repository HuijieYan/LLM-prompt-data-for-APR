### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the length and equality of axes between two `BlockManager` instances. Then, it consolidates the blocks and compares them based on type and location. 
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of block equality considers both type and location.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to the sorting logic in the function, where it only considers the type name of the block. This causes the function to consider identical blocks with different locations as equal, leading to the incorrect result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the type name and the location of the block when sorting. By including the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting key, we ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
return all(
    block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
)
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` in the sorting key, the function now correctly compares blocks based on both type and location, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
