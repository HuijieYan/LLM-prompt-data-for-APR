### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is expected to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic within the function, particularly in the part where it compares blocks using the `equals` method.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on their locations, we should compare them based on their actual values.
2. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks and comparing their content directly.
3. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to extract block values for comparison.
4. Update the comparison logic to compare block values rather than locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their actual content
    def get_block_values(blocks):
        return [block.values for block in blocks]

    self_block_values = get_block_values(self.blocks)
    other_block_values = get_block_values(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        (block_values == other_block_values[idx]).all() for idx, block_values in enumerate(self_block_values)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual content instead of just locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
