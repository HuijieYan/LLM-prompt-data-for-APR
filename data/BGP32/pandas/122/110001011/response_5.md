### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class because it wrongly returns `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations. This bug is caused by the use of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables that are sorted based on a tuple combining the type name and manager locations. However, this tuple does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function as it only considers the type name (`dtype.name`) and manager locations (`mgr_locs`) to canonicalize the blocks for comparison. This approach does not account for the actual content of the blocks which may have the same type and locations but different data values.

#### Bug Cause:
The `canonicalize` function does not accurately represent the content of the blocks which can lead to incorrect equality comparisons between blocks. This results in the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different data values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between blocks should account for the actual data values in the blocks rather than just the type name and manager locations. One possible strategy is to compare the data values of the blocks directly during the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables are used directly without sorting based on type names and manager locations. This ensures that the comparison between blocks considers the actual data values for equality checking.
