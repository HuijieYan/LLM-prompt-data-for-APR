### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances. It first checks if the axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks and compares them. The bug in this function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different location placements.
- The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function should return `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, but currently, it may return `True` incorrectly.

### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, which aims to order the blocks based on their dtype and locations. The logic used to compare and sort the blocks might not be handling the comparisons correctly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the usage of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function. Since the `mgr_locs` might contain varying locations for identical blocks, the comparison based on `mgr_locs` could lead to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of relying on `mgr_locs` for comparison, a more stable identifier for blocks should be used to compare. One approach could be to compare the actual data within the blocks while considering the dtype.

### Updated Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on dtype and values
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if block1.dtype != block2.dtype:
            return False
        return block1.values == block2.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype, block.values))
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This revised version compares blocks directly based on dtype and values, ensuring a more accurate comparison. It addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue by providing a more reliable comparison mechanism.
