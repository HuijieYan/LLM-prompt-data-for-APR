### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when comparing identical blocks in different locations due to the sorting mechanism in the function.
3. In the provided runtime scenario, the function fails to correctly identify the differences in block locations, leading to an incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the sorting of blocks based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This sorting does not handle cases where identical blocks exist in different locations, resulting in unexpected True output in the equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the sorting mechanism to handle identical blocks in different locations properly. One approach could involve comparison based on block content rather than location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_tuple()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now uses `block.to_tuple()` to adapt the sorting mechanism for comparison based on block content rather than just location. This change should resolve the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
