### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the axes of both instances are equal. Then it consolidates the blocks and compares them, while considering the order.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.
4. The bug is likely occurring due to the comparison of blocks without considering their exact locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks. We should ensure that the comparison considers the exact locations of the blocks to accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we update the `canonicalize` function to include the exact locations of the blocks by converting the `mgr_locs` to a tuple. This change ensures that the blocks are compared accurately, taking into account their exact locations.
