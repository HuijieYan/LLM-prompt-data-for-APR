### Identified Issues:
1. The `canonicalize` function is incorrectly defined causing potential comparison issues.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not considering all necessary attributes for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison discrepancy caused by the `canonicalize` function not properly handling the block attributes. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks, resulting in a wrong equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider all relevant block attributes in a consistent manner for proper comparison.
2. Ensure that the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is based on the correct canonicalization of block attributes.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values,
            block.shape,
            str(block.dtype) if hasattr(block, 'dtype') else None,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes updating the `canonicalize` function to properly handle block attributes for consistent comparison. It then sorts the blocks based on the canonicalized attributes to ensure accurate equality checks.
