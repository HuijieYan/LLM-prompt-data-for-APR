### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It checks if the axes are equal and then compares the blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals()` function wrongly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The issue likely stems from the sorting of blocks based on type and locations, causing similar blocks with different locations to be considered unequal incorrectly.
5. To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize()` function to consider only the block type during sorting, discarding the location information.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name  # Consider only block type for sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize()` function to consider only the block type, the function will correctly compare blocks without being affected by their locations. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
