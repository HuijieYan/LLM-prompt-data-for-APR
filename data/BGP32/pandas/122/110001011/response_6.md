### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The bug is likely related to the comparison logic in the function that leads to incorrect results.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in cases where the blocks have different locations but are identical.
   
### Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function is suspect, especially the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` and subsequent comparison.
2. The logic that checks if blocks are equal is likely encountering issues.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If the blocks have the same data but different locations, they may be treated as unequal.
2. The logic for block comparison (`block.equals(oblock)`) might be faulty, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the sorting criterion for blocks in a way that data content takes precedence over location.
2. Revise the block comparison logic to ensure that equal blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- We sort the blocks based on both the `values` and the `mgr_locs` to ensure that content and location are considered.
- We maintain the comparison logic that iterates over the sorted blocks and compares them appropriately.

This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
