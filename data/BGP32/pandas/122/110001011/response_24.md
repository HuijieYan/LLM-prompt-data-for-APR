### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is used to check whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The method compares the axes of the two instances and if they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it proceeds to check the blocks within each instance.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the method is returning `True` in some cases even when the blocks have different locations.
4. Based on the provided runtime values, the method goes through axis comparison correctly but fails when comparing the blocks due to the sorting logic based on type name and location, leading to incorrect results.

### Error Location:
The issue arises in the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and location to sort the blocks. This comparison mechanism is not effective when the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the sorting of blocks based on type name and manager locations does not account for cases where identical blocks exist but their locations are different. This leads to incorrect equality comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the block comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks without sorting
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare each block in `self.blocks` with any block in `other.blocks` to find a matching block. This way, we account for cases where identical blocks may have different locations within the `BlockManager` instances.
