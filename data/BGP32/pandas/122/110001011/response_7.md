### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, checks the number of blocks, sorts the blocks based on type and location, and then compares each block to determine equality.
3. The issue from GitHub highlights that the function might wrongly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.
4. The provided runtime values show that the buggy function fails to correctly identify the equality of blocks due to the sorting based on type and location.
5. The comparison of blocks should consider only the content, not the location.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the sorting of blocks in the `equals` function based on type and location, which leads to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the type of the block for sorting, removing the dependence on the location. Then the comparison should be based on the content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block type (dtype name) only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks content-wise
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based only on the type name (dtype name) of the block. This removes the dependence on the block location and ensures that the comparison is done based on the block content, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
