### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks the equality of axes and blocks between two BlockManagers.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks because the function fails to return False when the blocks in self and other are in different order but have the same contents.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function mistakenly assumes that identical blocks in different locations are different. This leads to incorrect comparison results, and the function incorrectly returns True when the blocks are the same but in a different order.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to correctly handle blocks that are identical but in different locations. One approach can be to sort the blocks based on their content and compare them. This will ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function will correctly handle the comparison of blocks with the same content but different locations, resolving the issue where the function wrongly returned True for identical blocks with different locations.
