### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. In the buggy implementation, the `.equals()` method is not adequate for comparing block equality. This results in the function returning `True` when identical blocks have different locations.
3. The bug results from the `canonicalize` function which orders the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations but does not handle cases where blocks are identical but with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how blocks are compared in the `equals` function based on their actual content rather than just type and location.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content, not just dtype and locations.
2. Ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
3. Update the comparison process to accurately reflect the content-based equality of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if set(self.blocks.keys()) != set(other.blocks.keys()):
        return False

    for block_key in self.blocks:
        self_block = self.blocks[block]
        other_block = other.blocks[block]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the blocks based on their content by iterating over all block keys and comparing each corresponding block in `self` and `other`. This ensures that blocks are compared for content equality rather than just type and location.
