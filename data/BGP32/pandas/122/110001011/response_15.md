### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` when the blocks are identical but located in different positions.

### Identified Errors
1. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances but does not take into account the ordering of the axes.
2. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, but this sorting can cause the function to incorrectly return `True` when blocks are actually in different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the comparison of identical blocks in different locations correctly. The sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs can sort blocks that are actually different but appear identical, leading to a false positive result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic for axes and blocks in a way that considers not just the content but also their positions.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that both the axes and blocks are compared element-wise, considering their positions. This approach addresses the bug reported on GitHub by accurately determining equality even when blocks are in different locations.
