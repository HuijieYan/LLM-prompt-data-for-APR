### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises when comparing the blocks. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize`, which orders them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This approach fails when two identical blocks have different locations, resulting in a false positive equality check.

The GitHub issue highlights this exact scenario where two DataFrames with swapped columns are incorrectly deemed equal by `equals()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the current comparison method does not consider the actual values within the blocks, only their types and locations. This leads to false positives in cases where blocks have the same contents but differing locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual values within the blocks. Comparing the contents of the blocks will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly deemed equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the contents of each block individually, ensuring that they are indeed equal before returning `True`. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
