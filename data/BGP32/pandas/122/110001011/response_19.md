### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` aims to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function might return `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `blocks` might not be accurate due to unconsolidated blocks.
2. The `canonicalize` function might not provide a unique key for block comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle unconsolidated blocks or distinguish between blocks with the same content but different locations. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons where blocks have the same values but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled or consolidated before comparison.
2. Improve the `canonicalize` function to create unique keys for block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. Blocks are consolidated before comparison to ensure accurate results.
2. The `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of values hash and manager locations for unique block comparison.
