### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the current implementation is incorrect because it fails to compare the content of the blocks properly. The comparison is based on the dtype name and the memory location of the blocks, which might not accurately reflect the block content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of relying on dtype names and memory locations. To achieve this, we should iterate over each block and compare the values inside them rather than comparing based on the sorted order of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for s_block, o_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over each block in both instances and comparing their content directly using the `equals` method of each block, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly determines the equality of two BlockManager instances based on their content.
