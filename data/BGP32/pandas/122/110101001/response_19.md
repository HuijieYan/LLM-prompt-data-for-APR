### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between self and other BlockManagers. The block order may differ, leading to incorrect results even if the contents are the same. The function tries to canonicalize the block order by sorting the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs, but there is an error in the sorting mechanism.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the canonicalization function to properly sort the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs. This will ensure that blocks are compared correctly. Additionally, we need to handle the case where blocks have different lengths or structures.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if block is not None and oblock is not None else block == oblock
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying the corrected function should now produce the correct comparison results, resolving the bug.
