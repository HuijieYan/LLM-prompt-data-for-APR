### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to arise from incorrectly sorting the blocks for comparison.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the block object in the `equals` function.

### Fix:
Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the type name and manager locations of the block for sorting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the `BlockManager` instances correctly based on their axes and blocks, passing the failing test case provided.
