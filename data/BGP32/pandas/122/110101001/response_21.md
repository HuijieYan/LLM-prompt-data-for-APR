The bug in the `equals` function is related to comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises from sorting the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing them using the `equals` method. 

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the unique identification of blocks. The comparison of blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` is causing inconsistencies when blocks are not fully consolidated.

To fix the bug, we need to address how blocks are sorted and compared. One approach is to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks explicitly. We can check if the blocks are consolidated before creating a canonical representation based on type name and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.is_consolidated():
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the comparison of blocks considers their consolidation status when creating a canonical representation for sorting. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
