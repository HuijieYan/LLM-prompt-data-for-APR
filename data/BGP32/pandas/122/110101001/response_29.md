### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises due to the use of `block.dtype.name` which returns the dtype name of the block (e.g., 'int64') as a string, rather than the actual dtype object. This causes the comparison of blocks to fail because blocks have different dtypes while representing the same underlying data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include both the dtype object and the block indices. This way, blocks with the same dtype and indices will be considered equal. We should also compare dtype objects directly within the `equals` method.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # include dtype object and mgr_locs into the comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing dtype objects and mgr_locs within the `canonicalize` function, blocks with the same underlying data will be considered equal, addressing the bug.
