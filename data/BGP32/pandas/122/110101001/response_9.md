### Analysis:
- The `equals` method is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `"a"` and `"b"`, with values interchanged between the columns.
- The buggy function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then sorts and compares their blocks. 
- The bug arises from the way blocks are sorted before comparison which does not account for the actual values within the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug in the provided `equals` method is in the `canonicalize` function. The function `canonicalize` only considers the dtype.name and mgr_locs for sorting blocks, ignoring the actual values in the blocks. This leads to incorrect ordering and subsequent false equality checks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the data values within the blocks when sorting them. This can be achieved by sorting based on the values present in the blocks themselves. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.internal_values().to_list()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

By sorting blocks based on their internal values, we ensure a correct comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances, thus fixing the bug.
