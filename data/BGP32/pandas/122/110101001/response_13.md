The bug in the `equals` function is related to how the blocks are sorted before comparison. The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the dtype name and `mgr_locs` comparison, which leads to incorrect sorting of blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function accurately captures the key for sorting the blocks. We should consider both the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` to compare blocks properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare and sort the blocks based on both dtype name and `mgr_locs`, passing the failing test provided.
