### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises when comparing blocks within each `BlockManager`. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks and comparing each block within the two `BlockManager` instances. However, the comparison of the blocks uses the `equals` method, which may not handle the comparison logic correctly for all types of blocks.

In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` are created with different column data types. The `equals` method should return `False` in this case because the content of the data frames is not equal. However, due to a potential issue in the comparison logic within blocks, the `equals` method may incorrectly return `True`, leading to a failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to make sure that the comparison of blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly. One approach is to handle the comparison of different types of blocks separately. We can enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type in addition to the block's data and implement custom logic for comparing blocks of different types.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if type(self_block) != type(other_block):
            return False
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method introduces a more robust block comparison logic that takes into account both block type and block data for equality checks. This should ensure that the comparison is performed correctly for different types of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
