### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of blocks between two instances. The function is comparing the blocks without considering the order of the columns between the two DataFrames. This leads to a false negative result when comparing DataFrames with columns in different order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on the column names along with the index locations of each block. This ensures that DataFrames with the same blocks but in different order will still be considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (tuple(block.dtypes), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will properly sort the blocks based on the data types of each block and the memory location of each block, ensuring that the comparison is done accurately even if the blocks are in different orders.
