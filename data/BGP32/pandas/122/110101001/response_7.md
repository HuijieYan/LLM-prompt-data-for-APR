### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of block values between `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. The comparison is based on the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. The bug causes incorrect comparison results due to the unsorted order of blocks before the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the order of blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManager objects is consistent before comparing the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort the blocks in order to ensure consistency
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly compare the block values between `self` and `other` BlockManager objects.
