### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the bug arises from the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances. The buggy function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized key, which includes the block's dtype name and manager locations. This approach is causing issues in the comparison because it is not handling the comparison of blocks with different data types correctly.

### Bug Location
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function sorting logic inside the `equals` function. Since it sorts blocks based on dtype and manager locations without considering dtype conversion scenarios, it leads to incorrect comparisons and eventually incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances considers potential data type conversion scenarios. We should separate the sorting of blocks based on dtype from the handling of manager locations to avoid incorrect comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # separate sorting of blocks by dtype and manager locations
    def sort_key(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By separating the sorting logic based on dtype only, the corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
