The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The comparison logic is based on sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function and then checking equality block by block, which may not work as expected due to potential issues with the ordering of blocks or the actual comparison logic within the `equals` method of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can restructure the comparison process by directly iterating over the blocks in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and checking for equality without relying on block sorting. This way, we can ensure a proper comparison of blocks based on the order they appear within the `blocks` lists.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Iterate over blocks in both BlockManagers and check for equality
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this modified approach, we directly iterate over the blocks in both BlockManagers `self` and `other` and compare them individually for equality. This should ensure a more accurate comparison between the two instances.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
