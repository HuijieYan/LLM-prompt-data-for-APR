### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not considering the tuple structure used to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function converts a block into a tuple using the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, which are then used for sorting. However, the comparison between the sorted blocks does not take into account the tuple structure, resulting in incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of sorted blocks to consider the tuple structure created by the `canonicalize` function. We can do this by comparing each element of the tuple separately in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each element of the tuple for equality
    return all(
        block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name and block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
