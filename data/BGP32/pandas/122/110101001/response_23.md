The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which aims to compare blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises when converting `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which may result in unexpected behavior. In the given failing test case, when comparing two DataFrames with columns of different types, the conversion of `mgr_locs` may lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should avoid converting `mgr_locs` to a list while canonicalizing the blocks for comparison. Instead, we can directly use the `mgr_locs` attribute without the need to convert it to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly using `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list, we maintain the original structure of `mgr_locs` and prevent any potential issues related to conversion. This correction should address the bug and make the function work as expected, passing the failing test case.
