### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from not handling the case where the blocks' order in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples can vary due to unconsolidated blocks, especially when sorting the blocks by `canonicalize`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare blocks correctly by considering the correct order of blocks in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` regardless of block consolidation. This can be achieved by preserving the original block order and then comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared in the correct order without being affected by block consolidation issues.
