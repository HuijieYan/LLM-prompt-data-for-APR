### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises because when comparing the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`, the order of blocks stored in each `BlockManager` might differ. The function sorts the blocks before comparing them, but the sorting mechanism used (`canonicalize` function) only considers the block's data type and manager locations (`mgr_locs`). If two blocks have the same data type and manager locations but are in a different order, the comparison will fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider not only the data type and manager locations but also the entire block data itself. By creating a unique identifier for each block that takes into account the actual block data, we can ensure that blocks are properly sorted and compared.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, data, and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the `BlockManager` objects based on the entire block data content, ensuring that the blocks are compared accurately.
