### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the comparison between the blocks in `self` and `other` does not consider the actual data within each block. The comparison relies on the order in which the blocks are stored, which may not accurately represent the equality of the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within each block rather than relying solely on the order of the blocks. We can achieve this by comparing the values within each block instead of their positions.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks by values rather than order
    def equal_blocks(block1, block2):
        return (block1.values == block2.values).all()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        equal_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares block values instead of their order, ensuring that the equality check is based on the actual data within each block.
