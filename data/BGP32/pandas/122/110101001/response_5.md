The bug in the `equals` function lies within the `canonicalize` function where it creates a tuple to sort the blocks. The bug is caused by calling `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` on an object of type `BlockPlacement`, which does not have the `as_array` attribute. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the necessary information from the `BlockPlacement` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that we extract the necessary information from the `block` objects correctly for sorting, addressing the bug that causes the failing test.
