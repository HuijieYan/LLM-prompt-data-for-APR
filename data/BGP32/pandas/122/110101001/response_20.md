### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function where the method `as_array` is called on `mgr_locs`, attempting to treat it as an array when it is not. This results in an AttributeError when trying to retrieve a list from `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Explanation:
When comparing the blocks using `canonicalize`, the buggy function attempts to access the `mgr_locs` as an array directly, assuming it can be converted to a list. However, the `mgr_locs` itself is a `BlockPlacement` object, and calling `as_array` on it raises an AttributeError since `BlockPlacement` does not have an `as_array` method. This leads to a failure in block comparison and the `equals` function returns False incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the information needed for block comparison from the `block` object. Instead of trying to convert `mgr_locs` as an array directly, we can utilize the information available in `mgr_locs` along with the `dtype.name` to create a tuple for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected function for canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we create a tuple that includes the necessary information for comparing the blocks efficiently. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` successfully.
