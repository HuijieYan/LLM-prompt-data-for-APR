### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. It fails to properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The issue is that the function uses a custom sorting function `canonicalize` to sort the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, but it incorrectly converts `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()` before sorting. This conversion is incorrect and leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is properly handled in the `canonicalize` function to maintain the correct block order during comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list, we can ensure that the blocks are properly ordered and compared, resolving the bug.
