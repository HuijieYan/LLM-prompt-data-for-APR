### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two BlockManagers for equality. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared between the two BlockManagers. The function compares the lengths of axes and whether each pair of axes equals each other correctly, but the comparison of blocks appears to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from the comparison of blocks where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison but the `canonicalize` function might not be correctly identifying unique blocks when sorting, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly identifies unique blocks for sorting. One potential approach could be to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their data type and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual `values` inside the block, we can ensure that blocks are correctly identified for comparison, which should fix the bug.
