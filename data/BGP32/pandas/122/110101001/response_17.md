### Bug explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks using the `dtype.name` attribute and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as a tuple key. However, for the `dtype.name` attribute, it is being accessed directly from the block object instead of the block's `dtype` attribute, leading to a TypeError when calling `dtype.name`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to access the `dtype` attribute of the block before trying to retrieve the `name` property. This will ensure that the type of the block is retrieved correctly for comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Fix for the bug
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly access the `dtype` attribute of the block object, we address the bug and ensure correct comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
