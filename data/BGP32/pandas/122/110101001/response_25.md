### Identify the bug
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. The function is incorrectly comparing the blocks of the two managers without considering the order of the blocks. As a result, the comparison fails even if the data is the same but stored in different block orders.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them. This will ensure that even if the blocks are in different orders, they will be considered equal if the data is the same.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test provided.
