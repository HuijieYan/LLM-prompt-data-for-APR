### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison of blocks requires retrieving the `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, and sorting the blocks based on these values. The bug arises due to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks because the `mgr_locs` are not being converted to a list properly when calling the `as_array` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug originates in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The `as_array` function is not being correctly accessed and converted to a list, leading to an incorrect comparison of block locations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `block.mgr_locs` object is not correctly converted to a list using `as_array`.
2. This results in the comparison of blocks being flawed and producing incorrect equality results.
3. The issue was identified in the GitHub issue where the DataFrame equality check failed for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `mgr_locs` object should be properly converted to a list before sorting and comparing blocks. This can be achieved by correctly calling the `as_array` function on `block.mgr_locs` to get the list of locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Correct the canonicalization of blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Correctly call as_array to convert to a list

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now correctly converts `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array` before comparing and sorting the blocks. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as intended, providing accurate equality checks for `BlockManager` objects.
