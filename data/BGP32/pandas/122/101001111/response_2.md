### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic of the blocks within the `equals` function.
3. The bug leads to incorrect comparison results even if the blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to a false equality result.
4. The bug causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic of blocks to consider not only the content but also the locations of the blocks.
2. We can canonicalize the blocks by sorting them based on a combination of the block type name and `mgr_locs`.
3. Ensuring that even if the blocks have the same content, their order is consistent based on their type and locations should resolve the issue.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction considers the block locations while comparing, ensuring accurate results as expected.
