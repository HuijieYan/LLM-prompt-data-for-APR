### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function resides in how it compares the blocks within the `self` and `other` instances. The function is erroneously ordering the blocks based on the block type (`dtype.name`) and the block locations (`mgr_locs`). However, for identical blocks with different locations, the function should return false, as stated in the GitHub issue. The current logic fails to account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block content besides just the block type and location. This modification will ensure that even if two blocks have the same type and location but different content, the function will correctly return false. By integrating the block content into the canonicalization process, we can align the `equals` function with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values_hash())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block content hash in the `canonicalize` function via `block.values_hash()`, we can accurately compare blocks and ensure that blocks with identical types and locations but different content are correctly identified as not equal. This correction aligns the functionality with the expected output based on the GitHub issue.
