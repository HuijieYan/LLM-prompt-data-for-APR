### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks inside the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The comparison of blocks is done by sorting them based on the `canonicalize` function which uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes of the blocks. However, the `dtype.name` attribute is not directly accessible from the `block` variable within the loop, leading to incorrect block comparisons and potentially returning `True` even when the blocks are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `dtype.name` attribute is correctly accessed within the loop where block comparisons are made. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed properly for each block.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Access dtype.name and mgr_locs properly
        return (block.__dict__['dtype'].name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks based on canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly accesses the `dtype.name` attribute from the `block` variable using `block.__dict__['dtype'].name` and ensures that `mgr_locs` is retrieved correctly for accurate block comparisons. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
