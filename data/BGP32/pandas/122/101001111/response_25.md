### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by first checking the equality of their axes and then comparing the blocks within them. However, there is an issue with the block comparison logic.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple for each block consisting of the block's dtype name and its location information. This is intended to handle unconsolidated blocks that may need to be distinguished by their iteration order.

However, the bug arises because it uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the tuple creation. The correct approach should be `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to get the actual list representation of the location, instead of the method itself.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly extract the location information from the block's `mgr_locs` attribute by calling `to_list()` on it. This will ensure that the comparison considers the correct location information for each block.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_list())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making this change in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison of blocks will now be based on the correct location information, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
