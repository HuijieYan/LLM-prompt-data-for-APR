### Bug Analysis
The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their attributes `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, then if the lengths of their `blocks` are equal, and finally, it sorts the blocks based on a defined `canonicalize` function and checks if each corresponding block is equal. The bug reported on GitHub states that it wrongly returns `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations, which indicates that the comparison logic is flawed.

### Bug Location
The bug likely happens during the sorting of the blocks using `canonicalize` function, where it only relies on the type name and `mgr_locs` to identify blocks. When comparing blocks, a more robust equality check should be performed considering the block data itself rather than just the location information.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the comparison relies heavily on the sorting order of blocks based on their type name and location. If two blocks contain the same data but at different locations, the current implementation may erroneously consider them unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, a comparison strategy that directly considers the content of the blocks should be implemented. We need to compare the data within the blocks rather than just their types and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on data equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly rather than reordering them based on a specific key, we address the issue of identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly identified as unequal.
