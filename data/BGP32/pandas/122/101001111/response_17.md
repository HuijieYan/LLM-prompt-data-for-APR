### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The bug identified in the GitHub issue states that the function erroneously returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
- The bug arises when sorting the blocks by type name and manager locations, which can lead to incorrect comparison results for blocks with the same content but different ordering.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function that combines the block's data type name and manager locations.
- Sorting the blocks in this manner can result in incorrect comparisons, especially if the blocks have identical content but are stored in different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug fix involves sorting the blocks in a way that does not consider the manager locations, ensuring that identical blocks are always considered equal regardless of their storage locations.
- We can modify the sorting criterion to only consider the block's data type name for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's data type name for sorting, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their storage locations. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
