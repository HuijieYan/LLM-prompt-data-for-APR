### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, blocks, and their corresponding blocks within each object. The issue arises when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on the data type name and manager locations. However, the bug causes the comparison to return `True` incorrectly even if the blocks have identical data but in different locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the block comparison where the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on data type name and manager locations but fails to consider the actual block content for equality comparison, leading to incorrect `True` results.

### Fix strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to also compare the actual block data in addition to data type name and manager locations when sorting and comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)  # Include block values in sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adds the `block.values` to the tuple used in sorting the blocks within the `canonicalize` function. This change ensures that the block content is considered during sorting and comparison, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
