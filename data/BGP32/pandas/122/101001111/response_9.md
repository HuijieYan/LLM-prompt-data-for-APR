### Analysis:
1. The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects by their internal structures such as axes and blocks.
2. The bug is identified in the logic involving the `canonicalize` function where it sorts the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` which might give inconsistent results if the locations are not identical.
3. The buggy function does not account for identical blocks with different locations, which contradicts the expected behavior in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the blocks themselves rather than their locations.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function removes the unnecessary sorting of blocks based on locations.
2. It directly compares the blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManager objects to determine equality.
3. This modification ensures that the comparison considers the actual block data rather than their locations, fixing the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
