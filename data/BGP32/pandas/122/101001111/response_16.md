### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function's implementation is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` object by sorting them and then checking if the blocks are equal based on their dtype and manager locations. However, the bug arises when comparing `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` objects which have different orderings between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the ordering of blocks between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are consistent for comparison. One way to achieve this is by first sorting the blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values as done in the buggy function. Then, comparing the sorted blocks for equality will ensure a correct comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both `dtype` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values, we ensure a consistent ordering before comparing the blocks for equality. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensures accurate comparisons between `BlockManager` objects.
