### Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The problem arises when comparing blocks within two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks that are located in different positions.

The issue is related to the way the blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on a tuple that combines the data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute can vary even for identical blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on both the data type name and the actual values of the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly deemed as equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to account for the actual block's values in addition to the data type name.
2. Sort the blocks based on the modified `canonicalize` function to ensure correct comparison.
3. Compare the sorted blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.to_numpy().tolist())  # Updated to include the block's actual values

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles the comparison of blocks and should provide the expected behavior, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
