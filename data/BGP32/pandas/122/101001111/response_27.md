### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking the equality of their axes, blocks, and block contents. However, the bug arises due to the incorrect comparison of blocks with different locations.

The issue reported on GitHub highlights this problem when `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This inconsistency arises from the way blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to refactor the block comparison process within the `equals` function. Specifically, when comparing blocks, we should consider both the block content and the block location to differentiate between identical blocks that are placed differently.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function considering block locations for comparison:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
