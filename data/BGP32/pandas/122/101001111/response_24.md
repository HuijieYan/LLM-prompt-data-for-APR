### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is not producing the correct results. The bug leads to erroneous comparisons between blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` due to incorrect sorting based on block dtype and manager locations.

### Bug Location:
The issue stems from the `canonicalize` function's incorrect implementation, causing the sorting to be flawed and leading to mismatched blocks during comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent the block's distinguishing attributes for proper sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values.__array_interface__['data']).encode('UTF-8')

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple containing the type of the block and its raw data memory location.
2. Sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the updated `canonicalize` function for correct comparison of blocks.
3. Encoded the sorting values to UTF-8 to ensure consistency.

By implementing these changes, the `equals` function will now correctly handle the comparison between blocks and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
