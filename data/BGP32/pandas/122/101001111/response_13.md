### Issue analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two different instances of `BlockManager` are equal. The function should compare the axes and blocks of each `BlockManager` instance to determine equality. However, there is a bug that causes the function to return incorrect results.

#### Bug description:
The bug arises in the comparison of block objects within the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance based on a custom `canonicalize` comparison key. The comparison key is generated using the block's data type name and location. However, the bug is due to not considering the `mgr_locs` attribute as a list when converting it into a tuple.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the `mgr_locs` attribute to a list using `tolist()` method before incorporating it into the comparison key. This will ensure that the function compares the blocks based on both data type and block locations accurately.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will generate the comparison key accurately and correctly detect equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
