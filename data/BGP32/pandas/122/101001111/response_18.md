### Identifying the Bug
- The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
- The bug occurs when checking if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
- The function first compares the axes, then consolidates the blocks, sorts them, and finally compares the sorted blocks.

### Explaining the Bug
- The bug occurs because the function mistakenly prioritizes the block comparison before consolidating the blocks.
- Since the blocks are not consolidated before comparison, identical blocks with different locations may not be recognized as equal.
- This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations are compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- The correct approach is to first consolidate the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them.
- By consolidating the blocks, we ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are treated as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by first consolidating the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances before comparing them. This ensures that blocks with the same content are considered equal regardless of their locations.
