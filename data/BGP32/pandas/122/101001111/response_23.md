### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class within the pandas library. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects even if the blocks within them have different locations. The issue arises due to the sorting of the blocks based on their properties leading to an inaccurate comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between blocks should be modified to consider their equality while accounting for potential differences in their locations. Instead of sorting the blocks solely based on their properties, a more nuanced approach should be taken to handle comparisons between blocks with different locations correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adjusting the comparison logic to consider both the values and the locations of the blocks, the corrected function ensures that blocks with different locations but identical values are correctly identified as not equal.
