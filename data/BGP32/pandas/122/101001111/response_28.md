### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes, blocks, and block order. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with the same data but potentially different locations which might affect the equality check. The issue mentioned on GitHub describes similar behavior where the `equals()` function wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks where the `canonicalize()` function sorts and compares the blocks based on dtype names and mgr_locs. If the mgr_locs are different but the data is the same, the comparison could falsely return False. 

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison strategy in the `canonicalize()` function, where the mgr_locs are used for sorting blocks. If two blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison will fail. This results in the `equals()` function incorrectly returning False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should focus on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. We can modify the `canonicalize()` function to only consider the dtype names for sorting blocks, disregarding the mgr_locs. This change will ensure that blocks with the same data are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction focuses on sorting the blocks based only on their dtype names and then comparing the blocks based on their content. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals()` function behaves correctly in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
