### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from mistakenly comparing blocks based on their order rather than their content. This can lead to incorrect equality comparisons when processing blocks with identical data but different locations. The bug arises from the logic used to sort and compare `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the tuple constructed by `canonicalize` function. The comparison should focus on the content of the blocks rather than their positions.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that the comparison of blocks relies on their content rather than their order. The comparison should check for equality based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their positions.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks is based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. By sorting and comparing the blocks using their values, the function now accurately determines equality based on the actual data within the blocks.
