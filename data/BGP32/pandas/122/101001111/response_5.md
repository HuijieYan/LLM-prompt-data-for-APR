### Bug Analysis:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly when the block locations are different even though the blocks themselves are identical. This issue leads to incorrect behavior when checking the equality of `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block values for sorting. Removing the dependence on block locations will ensure that identical blocks are recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # compare blocks directly without considering locations
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected `canonicalize` function that now only considers the block values, the `equals` function will correctly identify the equality of `BlockManager` objects. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the function was returning `True` incorrectly for identical blocks with different locations.
