### Analysis:
1. **Bug Description**: The bug causes the `equals()` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrame blocks with identical data but different locations.
2. **Error Location**: The bug lies in the `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks in a consistent order, which doesn't consider the block's data values but only the type and location.
3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The buggy function sorts blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs which leads to incorrect comparison outcomes when the blocks have the same data but different location information.
   - Due to this, the function misunderstands blocks with the same content in different locations as distinct, resulting in a false comparison.
4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - Instead of solely relying on dtype and mgr_locs, modify the canonicalize function to consider the content of the blocks as well.
   - Since the index values are the same in the compared DataFrame blocks, focus on comparing the actual data values within the blocks to determine equality correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize()` function to incorporate the block values along with the dtype and location details, the corrected `equals()` function will be able to properly identify blocks with the same content but different locations as equal, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
