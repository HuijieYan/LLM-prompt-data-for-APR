### Bug Explanation:
The issue is with the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is not correctly accessed, causing incorrect comparison results. This leads to the function wrongly returning `True` when the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the block's `mgr_locs` attribute.
2. Update the comparison step to compare blocks based on both the block content and their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_slice() for block in block.blocks))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version accurately sorts the blocks based on content and location, addressing the issue where identical blocks with different locations were mistakenly considered equal.
