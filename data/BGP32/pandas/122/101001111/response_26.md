### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order. However, the bug arises due to the comparison of blocks with different locations in memory. The `canonicalize` function is supposed to create a tuple based on block type and locations to ensure consistent ordering for comparison. Still, the bug emerges from the incorrect usage of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function.

The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations in memory but are otherwise equal. This behavior is due to the incorrect ordering of blocks based on their locations during comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly create a tuple for consistent block comparison. Instead of using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` directly, we should use `mgr_locs` directly within the tuple. This change will ensure that the block ordering is consistent based on their locations for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs` is directly included in the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that block comparison is consistent based on locations. This modification addresses the incorrect block ordering issue and aligns the function with the expected behavior.
