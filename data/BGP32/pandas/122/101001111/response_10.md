### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. However, it fails to consider the block order and potentially returns incorrect results due to unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue mentioned above.

### Error Locations:
1. The point where the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function can lead to incorrect results if blocks have the same content but different locations.
2. The comparison of blocks in the final return statement may not be accurate due to the sorting based on content and locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class does not account for unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations. This leads to false negatives in cases where the blocks should be considered equal based on content.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for blocks to ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal even if they have different locations. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to account for these scenarios to provide correct results.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.equals_value, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals_value == oblock.equals_value and block.dtype == oblock.dtype
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we include the `equals_value` property in the sorting mechanism to handle blocks with the same content but different locations. Additionally, we compare block content and data type in the final verification step. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide accurate equality checks for `BlockManager` objects.
