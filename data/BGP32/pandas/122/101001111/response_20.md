### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and blocks' data are the same. 

The issue arises because the function is mistakenly comparing blocks in a non-canonical order. By using `sorted` on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the function treats blocks with the same data but different memory locations as unequal, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their data rather than their memory locations. By transforming the blocks into a canonical order before comparison, we ensure that identical blocks are recognized as equal regardless of their memory locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [tuple(block.values.ravel()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we use `canonicalize_blocks` function to convert the block data into a list of tuples. Then, we compare these lists to determine equality based on block data rather than memory locations. This fix ensures accurate comparison of blocks within the `equals` function.
