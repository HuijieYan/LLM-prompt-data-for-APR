### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The issue arises from the sorting logic used to compare the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`, which might be incorrect since `mgr_locs` is accessed using the `as_array` attribute. This can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the locations of the blocks for comparison. We should ensure that the comparison is based on the block data and not on their location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now extracts the block data instead of the locations for comparison. This change ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations will be considered equal. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
