### Bug analysis
The bug is related to the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs when comparing `BlockManager` objects that have identical blocks but with different locations. The current implementation of the `equals` function does not account for block locations, leading to incorrect results.

The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return `False` when comparing `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations. This is described in the GitHub issue where a test case failed, indicating a mismatch in the expected output.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the `equals` function where the blocks are sorted without considering block locations. This leads to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by not accounting for block locations when comparing `BlockManager` objects. The sorting of blocks only considers the block type and not the locations, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting criteria. By incorporating block locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal. This will align the behavior of the `equals` function with the expected output described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function considers both the block type and the block locations, ensuring that blocks are sorted consistently based on their characteristics. This modification will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
