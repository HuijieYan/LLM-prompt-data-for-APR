### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking the equality of their axes, blocks, and contents.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks in a canonical order, but the sorting mechanism is flawed, leading to incorrect equality checks.
3. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations, resulting in false positives for equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the sorting mechanism for blocks to properly compare them based on their content and not just their type and location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their content, not just their type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values.tostring())  # Sort based on block type and content
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content by converting the block values to a byte string for comparison. This way, the `equals` method will correctly determine equality based on the actual block content and not just their type and location.
