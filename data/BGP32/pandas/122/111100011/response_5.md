### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` compares two instances of the same class by first checking the dimensions of their axes, then consolidating the blocks in-place, canonicalizing the blocks, and finally checking the equality of each block.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects them to be unequal, which currently fails.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that `DataFrame.equals()` incorrectly returns True when blocks are identical but in different locations, which aligns with the failing test case.
   
### Bug:
The bug arises in the buggy function `equals(self, other)` because it compares the blocks based on their order. If the blocks are identical but in different locations, the comparison wrongly returns True, leading to incorrect equality check.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to have a better check for block equality while accounting for potential differences in block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check block equality by creating sets of block representations
    self_block_set = {(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()) for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_set = {(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()) for block in other.blocks}
    
    return self_block_set == other_block_set
```

After making the above change, the `equals` function now compares blocks based on their data type and location information, ensuring that identical blocks in different locations are not considered equal. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test case pass.
