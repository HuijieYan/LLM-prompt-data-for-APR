### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two objects for equality. The issue is related to DataFrame objects not being equal when they have identical blocks with different locations. This bug was reported in GitHub issue #28839.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The function is comparing the lengths of the axes of two objects, but it should be comparing the axes themselves.
2. The function is sorting the blocks based on the tuple of dtype name and manager locations array, which could lead to incorrect comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of axes and sorting of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Compare the axes directly instead of their lengths.
2. Ensure the blocks are compared based on their content, not just the order.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(np.asarray(block._block).flat)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison is done correctly based on axes and block content, rather than just their order.

### Result
The corrected version of the function should now correctly compare DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
