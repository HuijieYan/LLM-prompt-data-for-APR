### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates both `BlockManager` instances, and then compares the blocks to determine equality.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have the same contents but are located at different positions.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the problem and expects the function to return `False` in such cases.
5. The function needs to take the block locations into account while comparing the blocks to correctly identify them as equal or not.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `equals` function to account for different block locations.
2. One approach is to compare the blocks based on content only without considering their locations.
3. We can sort the blocks by dtype name and content to ensure a consistent comparison.
4. This modification will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class will now correctly handle comparison of blocks, considering the content and dtype name to determine equality. This change will address the reported bug and make the function behave as intended.
