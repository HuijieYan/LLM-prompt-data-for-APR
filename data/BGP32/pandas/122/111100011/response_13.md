### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library.
2. The function compares two instances of BlockManager for equality based on axes and blocks.
3. The bug is causing the function to return True incorrectly when `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same data but different locations.
4. The bug stems from the comparison of blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this bug by creating two DataFrames with the same data but different order, expecting the `equals` function to return False.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the actual data and their locations within the blocks when comparing. This means we should compare not just the blocks themselves but also their locations within the BlockManager.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array) for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        s_block_loc in other_blocks and other_blocks[other_blocks.index(s_block_loc)][0] == s_block
        for s_block, s_block_loc in self_blocks
    )
```

By including the values and locations of the blocks in the comparison, the corrected version should now accurately determine if two instances of BlockManager are equal based on both content and location of the blocks.
