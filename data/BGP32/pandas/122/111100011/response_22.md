In the provided buggy function `equals`, there are a couple of potential error locations which could be causing the bug:

1. The comparison of block lengths (`len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks)`) might not be accurate due to unconsolidated blocks that could have different locations but identical content.
2. The sorting of blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) based on the output of the `canonicalize` function can lead to incorrect comparisons if there are blocks with the same type name but different locations.

The bug arises because the function `equals` is incorrectly identifying DataFrames with blocks in different locations as equal. The comparison logic in the function does not take into account the potential for unconsolidated blocks to have different locations but identical content, leading to a False negative result.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information about the block locations when sorting the blocks for comparison. This will ensure that blocks with the same type name but different locations are not falsely identified as equal.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now properly compare DataFrames and correctly detect when blocks with the same content but different locations are not equal. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
