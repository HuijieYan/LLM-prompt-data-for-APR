### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the number of axes are the same, then if each axis is equal. It then consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance and compares the blocks for equality.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations but identical contents. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes with columns in different order are equal. Due to the implementation of the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns True in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks by content in a canonical way to properly compare them.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.view(),)  # Use view of values for comparison
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function will now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
