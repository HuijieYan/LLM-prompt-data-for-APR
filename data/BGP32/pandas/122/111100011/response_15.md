### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The bug occurs because the function fails to properly compare blocks with different locations due to the sorting mechanism used.
5. To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than their locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the blocks for comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to compare the content of each block instead of their locations.
3. Update the `equals` function to use the modified comparison logic.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    self_blocks_content = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]

    if len(self_blocks_content) != len(other_blocks_content):
        return False

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function properly compares the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances for equality, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
