### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is attempting to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class by comparing their axes, blocks, and block types.
2. The issue stems from the fact that when comparing blocks, the order is not canonicalized properly and can lead to false positives when the blocks have identical contents but different locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that when comparing two dataframes with identical values but different column ordering, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we consider both block content and block location to avoid false positives.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class does not take into account the block locations when comparing blocks, leading to false positives when the order of the blocks differs.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider both block content and block location when comparing blocks. By sorting the blocks based on a combination of block type and location, we can ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now correctly identify cases where identical blocks with different locations are not equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
