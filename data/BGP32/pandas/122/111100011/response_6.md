### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
- The issue arises when comparing two DataFrames where the blocks are identical but in different locations.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by creating two DataFrames with the same content but in different column orders.
- The GitHub issue details a similar problem where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True instead of False.

### Error location:
- The issue occurs in the `equals` method when comparing blocks by ordering them based on their type name and location. This can lead to misidentifying identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on their type name and location. This sorting method can lead to incorrectly identifying blocks as different even when their content is identical.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should compare blocks based on their content rather than sorting them by type name and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in other.blocks}

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

### Updated Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we compare the blocks based on their contents rather than sorting them. We use a dictionary to store the blocks with their location as the key, allowing us to compare the blocks directly. This change ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified, resolving the issue of returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
