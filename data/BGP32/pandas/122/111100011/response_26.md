### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block locations are equal.
3. The bug is causing the function to return True incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations. This is an issue reported on GitHub (#28839).
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks of both objects based on a canonical representation that includes the block dtype and block locations before comparing them.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.data.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on dtype as a string and the block locations as bytes, we ensure that even if the blocks have the same content but different internal representations, they will still be compared correctly. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected, passing the failing test case.
