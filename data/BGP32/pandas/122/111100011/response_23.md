## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their `self_axes`, `blocks`, and sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations.
3. The bug was reported in a GitHub issue where calling `equals` method on two identical DataFrames with different block locations returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The buggy logic in the `equals` function is that it doesn't take into account the case where identical blocks might have different locations, leading to incorrect `True` result.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` function to compare the block content rather than just sorting and comparing the block locations.
2. We should iterate through each block in both instances and compare their content to ensure that the DataFrames are truly equal irrespective of block locations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their content rather than locations. This change ensures that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is based on the actual block data rather than just their positions.
