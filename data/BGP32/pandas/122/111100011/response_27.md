### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas.
2. The issue is related to the comparison of DataFrame blocks when checking for equality.
3. The bug causes `equals` to return True incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to canonicalize the blocks' order based on type name and locations before comparing them.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in DataFrames without considering their locations. This can lead to incorrect equality check results when the block locations are different but the blocks themselves are the same. The bug is specifically highlighted in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Canonicalize the order of blocks by sorting them based on a combination of type name and location.
2. Ensure that blocks are properly consolidated before comparison to maintain correctness.
3. Update the `equals` function to consider the sorted and canonicalized blocks for equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order based on type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction to the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, the function should now correctly check for equality between DataFrames based on canonicalized block ordering, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
