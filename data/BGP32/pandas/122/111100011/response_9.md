### Analyze the buggy function:

1. The buggy function is a part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The `equals` function checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` objects are equal in length.
4. It then checks if all axis objects are equal using the `equals` method from the axis class.
5. It consolidates both `BlockManager` objects in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
6. It checks the length of blocks in both objects. If they are not equal, returns False.
7. It then sorts and compares the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects for equality based on data type and location.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of blocks' data types leading to the bug.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks based on data type and location may not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Cause of the bug:
The existing implementation of the `equals` function tries to canonicalize and compare blocks based on data type and location. However, if two blocks in different `BlockManager` objects are identical but have different locations, the comparison fails, leading to a wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
2. Find a way to compare blocks based on actual content rather than just data type and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.asig: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.asig: block for block in other.blocks}

    if self_blocks.keys() != other_blocks.keys():
        return False

    for key in self_blocks.keys():
        if not self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks in both objects based on their content rather than just data type and location, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test and correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
