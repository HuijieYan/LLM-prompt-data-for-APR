### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances based on their attributes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which should return `False`.
3. The bug arises due to the way blocks are compared without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content and location.

### Steps to Fix the Bug:
1. Update the `equals` function to consider both the content and the location of blocks while comparing.
2. Sort the blocks based on their content and location before comparing.
3. Update the comparison logic to include the index of the blocks.
4. Return `False` if any mismatch is found during block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Update the equals function with correct block comparison
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False    
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should properly handle the comparison of blocks and accurately determine the equality of two instances based on their content and location. This fix should address the reported issue on GitHub as well.
