### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug is identified in the comparison of blocks. The blocks need to be sorted and compared one-by-one to ensure their equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` attempts to compare two dataframes with different data types under the same column labels and expects the `equals` method to return `False`, but it wrongly returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks and then compare them to ensure they are equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the blocks are not sorted before comparison in the `equals` method. This can lead to a scenario where identical blocks with different locations are wrongly considered as equal. This is evident from the failing test provided.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparison. This will guarantee that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `equals` method implementing block sorting, the comparison will correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and pass the failing test provided.
