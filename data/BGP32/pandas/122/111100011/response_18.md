### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two sets of blocks within the `self` and `other` instances. 
2. The function is failing to correctly identify blocks with different locations but identical content.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames with the same data but different order of columns are considered equal, which they should not be.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the discrepancy in the behavior of `equals` method when dealing with identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing blocks with the same content but different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To overcome this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to sort and canonicalize the blocks in a consistent manner before comparing them for equality. This ensures that even if the blocks are in different locations, but contain identical content, they will be considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(tuple(block.items()) + tuple(block.dtypes))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `equals` function to use a consistent and sortable key for canonicalization of blocks, we ensure correct comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test provided.
