### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the BlockManager class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function is specifically intended to check for equality of blocks in two different instances of BlockManager.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for cases where the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem where the `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly returns `True` for dataframes `df1` and `df2` which have identical blocks but different locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks in addition to dtype.name.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())  # Include block locations
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Explanation:
1. In the `canonicalize` function, we modified the tuple returned to include the locations of the blocks using `tostring()` method.
2. By including the block locations in the comparison, we can accurately detect when blocks with the same content are at different locations.
3. This change ensures that the `equals` function behaves correctly when comparing two instances of `BlockManager` with blocks at different locations but with the same content.
