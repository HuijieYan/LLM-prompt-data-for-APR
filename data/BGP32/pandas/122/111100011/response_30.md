### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and other properties.
3. The bug arises when comparing the blocks of the two instances in a non-standardized order, leading to incorrect equality results.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the issue by comparing two DataFrames with mismatched data, expecting a `False` result, but receiving `True` due to the bug.
5. The GitHub issue highlights this bug, clearly stating the expected output and the actual behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, update the `equals` function to standardize the order of blocks for comparison.
2. Sort the blocks based on a consistent criterion (e.g., block dtype name and mgr_locs), ensuring a deterministic order.
3. Compare the sorted blocks one by one and return `False` if any pair is not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using this corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
