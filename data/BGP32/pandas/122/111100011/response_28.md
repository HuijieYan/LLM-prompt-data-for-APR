### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is equal, then consolidates both instances in place, sorts the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, and finally compares each block.
3. The bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations due to the sorting mechanism applied to the blocks.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by comparing two DataFrames with different values but the same keys which should return `False`, but the buggy function returns `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This function does not account for different locations of identical blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider a unique identifier for each block that distinguishes between duplicate blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the unique identifier generated by `id(block)` along with dtype name and `mgr_locs` bytes representation to ensure that blocks are correctly sorted and compared. This approach addresses the issue of identical blocks with different locations.
