### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class based on their axes and blocks. The comparison is checking the number of axes, the equality of axes, and then comparing individual blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames with reversed columns are equal using the `equals` function, and it expects the result to be False.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function is wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the failing test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of individual blocks after sorting them. If two blocks are identical but have different locations, the comparison will wrongly identify them as unequal because of the order in which they are compared after sorting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider identical blocks with different locations as equal. One approach could be to compare blocks directly without sorting them, ensuring that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares blocks without sorting them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are considered equal. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
