## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
- The problem is related to comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same structure.
- The bug was reported on GitHub with a clear description and the expected output.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug arises because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This comparison does not account for the actual values within the blocks.
- As a result, even if the blocks have different values but the same structure, the comparison incorrectly returns `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the `equals` method to consider the actual values within the blocks.
- We should compare the values within the blocks, not just their types and locations.
- We can achieve this by comparing the values of each block element-wise.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self._reindex_blocks_like(other)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `values` within the blocks rather than their types and locations, we ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
