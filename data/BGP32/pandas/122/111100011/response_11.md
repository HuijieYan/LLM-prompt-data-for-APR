## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` using their `axes` and `blocks` attributes.
2. The function checks if the length of `self.axes` and `other.axes` are equal and if each corresponding pair is equal by calling the `equals` method on each pair.
3. The issue arises when comparing the `blocks` attribute. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` and then checks if each corresponding pair of blocks are equal. This sorting mechanism fails to distinguish between blocks with identical data but located at different positions.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with identical data but in reverse order. It expects the `equals` method to return `False` but it currently returns `True`.
5. To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to properly handle cases where identical blocks are located at different positions within the `BlockManager`.

## Updated Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `tostring` representation of the block values in the `canonicalize` function, we can properly distinguish between blocks with identical data but different positions. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method behave as expected.

After applying this fix, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should now pass successfully.
