### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks within each instance based on a canonical identifier, and then compares each block for equality.
3. The bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which results in a false positive for equality.
4. The bug is reported in a GitHub issue with a failing test that demonstrates the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks based solely on the canonicalization of the blocks without considering their actual content or location.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of comparing the blocks within the `equals` function to consider the actual content of the blocks, rather than relying solely on their canonical representation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for sb, ob in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not sb.equals(ob):
            return False

    return True
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now performs a direct comparison of each block's content within the two `BlockManager` instances to ensure that they are truly equal. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
