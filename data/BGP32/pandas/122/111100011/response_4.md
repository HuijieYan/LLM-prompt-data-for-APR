### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class for equality based on their properties.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the instances.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects `equals` method to return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar scenario where `equals` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. When comparing blocks, it sorts them using a custom key (`canonicalize` function) based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same content but different locations (mgr_locs), they would not be considered equal since the comparison does not consider the content itself.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content instead of just their order. One way to achieve this is to iterate over the blocks and compare them directly rather than sorting them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By iterating directly over the blocks and comparing them one-to-one, we ensure that the comparison is based on the block content rather than their order.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test provided.
