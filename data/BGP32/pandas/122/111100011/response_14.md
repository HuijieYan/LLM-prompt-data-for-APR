### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and if their blocks are identical. This function is called by the `DataFrame.equals()` method.
   
2. The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The issue occurs due to the comparison based on the location of the blocks rather than their actual content.

3. The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return True even when the actual content of the DataFrames is not the same, as seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

4. To fix this bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. One approach could be to iterate over the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances and compare the content of each block directly.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the content of the blocks by converting the `block.values` to a string representation for ordering the blocks. By doing so, the comparison is based on the actual block content rather than their locations, which resolves the bug and makes the function return the correct result.
