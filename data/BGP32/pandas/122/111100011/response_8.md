### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` (self and other). It checks if their axes are the same, consolidates them inplace, sorts and canonicalizes the blocks, and compares them.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns False.
3. The GitHub issue reports that `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True when it should return False. This is due to identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks' content without considering their locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic inside the `equals(self, other)` function to account for the block locations by iterating over blocks based on their type and location.
2. Update the canonicalization of blocks to include the locations in the tuple for comparison.
3. Ensure that when comparing blocks, the content and locations are both considered.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False
    
    for key in self_blocks.keys():
        if not self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By updating the `equals(self, other)` function as shown above, the issue reported in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
