### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class, which is used to check equality with another `BlockManager` object.
2. The `equals` function compares the axes, consolidates the axes inplace, sorts and compares the blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The bug is identified as the comparison between blocks not taking into account the location of the blocks, leading to incorrect True return from the `equals` method in certain cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in its comparison to ensure that it considers both the block type and locations for equality check.


### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. Currently, it only considers the data type name of the block and not the block locations. This leads to incorrect True return even when the blocks have different locations but same content.

### Proposed Fix:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison.
- Update the `equals` method to consider block locations in addition to data type names for sorting and comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # previous methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Include block locations

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, with the corrected version provided above, the `equals` method should correctly compare the blocks with both data type names and block locations, ensuring a proper equality check.
