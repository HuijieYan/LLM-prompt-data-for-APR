## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two objects based on their axes and blocks and return True if they are equal.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a scenario where the `equals()` function wrongly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug seems to occur due to the inconsistent handling of blocks' locations during comparison.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison includes the block locations in addition to block content.
5. The corrected version of the function should address this inconsistency and pass the failing test case.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__array_interface__["data"][0], block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function now considers both the block content and their locations for comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()`.
