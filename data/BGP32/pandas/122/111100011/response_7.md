### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The buggy function compares the axes, consolidates both instances in place, and then compares the blocks. The issue arises in block comparison due to identical blocks having different locations.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle cases where blocks have different locations but are still considered equal, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The corrected version below addresses the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_unique_hash = {key: hash(value) for key, value in self.blocks.items()}
    other_unique_hash = {key: hash(value) for key, value in other.blocks.items()}

    return self_unique_hash == other_unique_hash
```

This corrected version redefines the comparison logic to hash each block's values and compare the hashes instead of comparing the blocks directly. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are considered equal.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
