### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks for equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in the opposite order and checks if `equals` method returns `False`, which is the expected behavior. The bug causes the method to incorrectly return `True`.
4. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks in different locations but with the same content. The sorting of blocks without considering their locations causes the bug.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method to consider both the `dtype` and the actual data of the block for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, considering dtype and data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing blocks based on both the `dtype` and the actual data, we ensure that even blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
