### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to check the equality of two instances of `BlockManager`. However, due to a bug, it currently returns `True` even when the blocks within the instances have different locations.
   
2. The bug occurs because of the comparison logic inside the function that sorts the blocks based on the block's data type and locations. The comparison doesn't properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations.
   
3. The failing test shows that when comparing two DataFrames with identical data but different block locations, the function wrongly returns `True`.
   
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
   
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional criteria for comparison to properly differentiate blocks with different locations.
   
3. Ensure that the function now correctly returns `False` when faced with identical blocks but different block locations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Function to get block values along with their locations
    def get_block_values(blocks):
        return [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.index_map) for block in blocks]
    
    self_blocks = get_block_values(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = get_block_values(other.blocks)
    
    # Compare block values and locations
    return all(
        (self_block_values == other_block_values) 
        and (self_block_locs == other_block_locs)
        for (self_block_values, self_block_locs), (other_block_values, other_block_locs)
        in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations and return `False` in such scenarios.
