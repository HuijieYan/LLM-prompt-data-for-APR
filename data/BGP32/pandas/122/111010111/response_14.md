### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes, blocks, and blocks' contents.
2. The comparison involves iterating over the blocks of both objects and comparing each block using the `equals` method for blocks.
3. The issue arises because the comparison isn't handling identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to a false positive equality result.
4. The failing test expects the `equals` method to return False for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because it doesn't consider the possibility of identical blocks in different locations, leading to a false positive equality result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for cases where identical blocks exist in different locations. We can address this by ensuring that the comparison considers the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly by their contents instead of location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._values
            
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks exist in different locations and return the expected equality result.
