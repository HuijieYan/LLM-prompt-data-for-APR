### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class of pandas is designed to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block locations.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances. The `canonicalize()` function is used to sort the blocks, but there might be an issue with how the blocks are being compared.
4. The bug might be due to comparing the blocks directly instead of considering their contents. When comparing blocks, it should check the block data for equality rather than relying solely on their locations.
5. We need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that the content of the blocks is being compared for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class to properly compare the content of the blocks when checking for equality.
2. Instead of comparing blocks based on their locations, compare them based on their actual data to determine if they are equal.
3. Adjust the `canonicalize()` function or introduce a new method to compare the actual data of the blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equal(block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the actual data (`block.values`) of the blocks instead of their locations, we ensure that the `equals()` method correctly checks for equality between two `BlockManager` instances. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected output for the failing test.
