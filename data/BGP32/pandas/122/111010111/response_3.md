### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas.core.internals.managers` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the test failed because it expected the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but it evaluated to `True`.
3. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, sorts the blocks, and then compares them for equality based on type and location. The bug might be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared.
4. The GitHub issue confirms a related bug report regarding `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from the way the blocks are sorted and compared. Since the blocks might have different locations and hence different `mgr_locs`, sorting based only on `dtype.name` would not be sufficient. This could lead to the wrong comparison result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. By including the `mgr_locs` in the sorting criteria, we ensure that blocks with identical types but different locations are considered properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the bug by properly considering both the type and location of the blocks when comparing them, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
