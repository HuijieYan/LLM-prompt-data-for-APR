### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**:
    - The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
    - This method is called to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
    - The function initially compares the axes, then consolidates the blocks, and finally compares the blocks.
   
2. **Error Location**:
    - The error seems to be occurring in the block comparison part of the function.
    - The isEqual method is likely not functioning as expected, leading to the incorrect return value.

3. **Bug Cause**:
    - The bug occurs because the logic for comparing block locations is not correctly implemented.
    - This causes the function to mistakenly report `True` when the block locations are different but the data within the blocks is the same.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
    - The function needs a proper implementation to compare the block locations accurately.
    - The comparison should consider the content within the blocks alongside the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    canonicalize_blocks = lambda blocks: [(b.values, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for b in blocks]
    
    self_block_info = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_block_info = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    if len(self_block_info) != len(other_block_info):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_block_info, other_block_info):
        if self_block[1] != other_block[1]:  # Check if block locations are different
            return False
        self_values, other_values = self_block[0], other_block[0]
        if not np.array_equal(self_values, other_values):  # Check if block values are the same
            return False
    
    return True  # All checks passed
    
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a lambda function `canonicalize_blocks` to extract block values and locations.
2. Compared block locations correctly in a loop.
3. Compared block values alongside locations to ensure complete equality.
4. Return `False` if any location or value comparison fails, otherwise return `True`.
