### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking axes, consolidating them, comparing the number of blocks, and then iterating through the blocks to check if they are equal.
3. The error is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks since it's sorting them by dtype name and mgr_locs which might result in incorrect equality comparisons between blocks with the same data but different locations.
4. We need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is done correctly regardless of their locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of sorting the blocks by dtype name and mgr_locs, we should compare blocks directly based on their data content.
2. We should compare block data directly to check if they are equal.
3. We should also ensure that the other conditions related to axes and number of blocks are satisfied.
4. Update the comparison logic to accurately compare the blocks inside the `equals` function.

### Updated corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare blocks directly by iterating through them and checking equality
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated version of the function directly compares the blocks without sorting them, ensuring that the equality checks are done correctly and addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue. This should fix the bug reported in the failing test.
