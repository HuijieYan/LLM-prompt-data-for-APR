### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The issue arises from incorrect comparison logic causing the function to incorrectly return True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the expected result was False but the actual result was True.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic handles block equality checks correctly while considering the block location.
5. The corrected version of the function is presented below.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider not only the block content but also the block locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on a combination of block type and block locations to ensure proper comparison.
3. Update the function to check for block equality iteratively while comparing the sorted blocks of each instance.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes , self_blocks = self.axes, other.axes, self.blocks
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After implementing these changes, the corrected version of the function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances considering block equality and locations. This should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
