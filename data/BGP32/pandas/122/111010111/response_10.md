### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas project.
2. The function compares the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to correctly identify when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal by comparing their blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Specifically, the function is comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances without considering their order, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to sort the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` (as locations may differ due to unconsolidated blocks).
2. Then compare the sorted blocks to determine if the `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version ensures that two `BlockManager` instances are correctly compared for equality. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
