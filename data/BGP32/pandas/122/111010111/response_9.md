### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be problematic if the axes are not being properly compared.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function might cause an issue if the function is not properly implemented.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is incorrectly identifying DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as equal. This is due to the improper comparison of axes and blocks in the function.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is accurate.
2. Check the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure it sorts the blocks correctly based on type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now properly compares the DataFrames based on their blocks' types and locations, addressing the issue described in the GitHub problem.
