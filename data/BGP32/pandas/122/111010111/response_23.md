### Analysis:
1. The `BlockManager` class contains a method named `equals`, which compares two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic implemented within the `equals` method.
3. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it returns `True`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug is likely in the comparison logic based on the block properties and their locations.

### Bug:
The bug stems from the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, causing the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to handle cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.
2. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on a unique criterion to maintain consistent order for comparison.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their locations, the corrected method ensures that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly during comparison.
