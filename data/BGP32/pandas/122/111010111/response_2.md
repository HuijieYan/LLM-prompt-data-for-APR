### Error Location
The bug lies within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The issue originates from the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison needs to reflect differences in the location of blocks to ensure correct equality comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `equals` function compares blocks based on their order, but it should also consider the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block to differentiate between blocks with the same content but different locations.
2. Due to the lack of consideration for the `mgr_locs` attribute in the comparison, identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block when sorting the blocks.
2. Update the comparison of blocks in the loop to consider both the content and the `mgr_locs` attribute.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly compare blocks based on both their content and the location within the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not falsely considered equal.
