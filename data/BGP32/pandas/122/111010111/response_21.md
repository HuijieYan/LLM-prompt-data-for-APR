### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if the axes and blocks are equal.
3. The failing test is asserting that the `equals` method should return `False` for two dataframes with different values but same columns' names.
4. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
5. The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for two dataframes with different values but the same columns' names, and the user expects it to return `False`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the comparison being based solely on the blocks' content without considering block locations. This causes the method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing dataframes with different values but similar block structures.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include block locations in addition to content. This will ensure that even if the content is the same, the comparison will be different if the block locations are not identical.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Include block locations in comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now properly considers block locations in addition to block content when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
