### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` within the class `BlockManager` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block equality match.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing `assert True is False`.
3. The bug is likely due to the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` not being correctly considered for equality comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that before comparing blocks for equality, they are sorted based on a consistent criterion to avoid false positives in the equality check.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on a canonical criteria before comparing them for equality.
2. Modify the `equals()` function to first sort the blocks by a consistent criterion (like data type and location) and then compare the sorted blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by a canonical criterion before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the sorting step based on `canonicalize()` function, the corrected version should now accurately compare the blocks and return the correct equality status.
