### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is `equals(self, other)`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
3. The error message states that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
4. The expected behavior is for the `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` since the two `DataFrame` objects have different values in their columns.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a bug related to `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The function first compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, which seems correct.
2. Next, it checks if each axis is equal using a generator expression, which is reasonable.
3. The function then consolidates the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects in place, which is fine.
4. The bug might be in the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
5. The sorting of blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs` to canonicalize might also be a potential source of error.
6. Finally, comparing each block between `self` and `other` for equality could be where the bug lies.

### Cause of the bug

The bug likely occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison and sorting based on `mgr_locs` for canonicalization may not be effectively distinguishing between blocks correctly. This, in turn, leads to the function incorrectly returning `True`, as observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic between blocks within the `BlockManager` objects is accurate. This includes properly handling the sorting based on type name and block locations, as well as comparing each block for equality in a reliable manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By ensuring that the sorting and comparison of blocks are correctly implemented, this corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to `DataFrame.equals()` incorrectly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
