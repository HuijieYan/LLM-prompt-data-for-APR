### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Review**:
    - The buggy function is named `equals` and is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file.
    - The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on multiple checks including the equality of axes and blocks.
    - The function depends on the `equals` method of the objects in `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
   
2. **Potential Error Locations**:
    - The initial comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is correct.
    - The subsequent equality check loops through pairs of `self_axes` and `other_axes` which seems expected.
    - Errors could be due to the comparison logic of the blocks and the sorting logic in the function.

3. **Bug Explanation**:
    - The failing test is due to `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True` instead of `False`.
    - The function performs a comparison between itself and another `BlockManager` instance.
    - The issue arises when comparing the order of blocks based on their type name and manager locations.
    - The incorrect comparison logic currently allows identical blocks to be reported as equal even when their locations differ.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
    - Fix the block comparison logic by ensuring that the comparison takes into account the block's location as well.
    - This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location.
    - Update the return statement to consider the correct comparison of blocks and their locations.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the block's location in the comparison, the corrected function provides the expected behavior as described in the failing test.
