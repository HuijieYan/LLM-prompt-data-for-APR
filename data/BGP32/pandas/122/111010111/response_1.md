### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message is stating that `assert True is False`, indicating that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The expected input values for the axes, self, other, self.blocks, and other.blocks are provided.
4. The function is comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, and the comparison logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the wrong return value.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a bug in `DataFrame.equals`, which is related to the issue raised in the test case.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison block where it checks if `all` blocks are equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the current block comparison logic does not correctly handle situations where the blocks have identical data but different locations, resulting in incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare the block data and locations separately to ensure accurate equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.block_type, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared based on their data and locations. This change should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result in the failing test case.
