### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their attributes like axes, blocks, and block content equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The cause of this bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function where the order of blocks is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect equality check.
4. The failing test case demonstrates the issue by comparing two DataFrames with swapped data values but same structure, which should evaluate to `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparison to accommodate for any differences in block order.
2. We will modify the `canonicalize` function to consider ordering based on the block type (`dtype.name`) and the block locations (`mgr_locs`).
3. After sorting the blocks based on the modified `canonicalize` function, we can compare the blocks for equality using `all`.
4. By sorting the blocks based on type and locations, the function can correctly identify the equality of two `BlockManager` objects even when the block order differs.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Modified canonicalize function to sort blocks based on type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.blocks[0])

    # Sort self and other blocks using the new canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By implementing the sorting of blocks based on type and locations before the equality comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and correctly identify the equality of `BlockManager` objects.
