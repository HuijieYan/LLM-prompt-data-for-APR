### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
3. The error is likely due to the comparison of objects that have identical blocks but different locations, leading to `equals` incorrectly returning True.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the consistency of block order between the two `BlockManager` objects.
5. The corrected version of the function should address this issue to pass the failing test.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the `canonicalize` function that considers both the data type and the locations of the blocks, the corrected function will compare the `BlockManager` objects more accurately. This correction should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values, passing the failing test.
