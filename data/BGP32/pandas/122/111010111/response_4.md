### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing, leading to a `True` result when it should be `False`.
4. The issue posted on GitHub confirms that the function is returning `True` incorrectly in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Error Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to be caused by comparing blocks in different locations but with the same content. To resolve this, we should modify the comparison mechanism to consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Updated Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = []
        other_blocks = []
        for block in self.blocks:
            block_data = block.values
            self_blocks.append(block_data)
        
        for block in other.blocks:
            block_data = block.values
            other_blocks.append(block_data)
            
        return all(
            np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function directly compares the values of the blocks instead of their locations, resolving the issue of returning `True` when the blocks have the same data but different locations.
