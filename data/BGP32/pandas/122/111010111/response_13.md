### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block ordering are the same.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that it is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different DataFrames.
3. The function calculates `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by sorting the blocks in each `BlockManager` by `canonicalize` function which combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The bug might be in the `canonicalize` function or the comparison logic.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, the expected behavior of the `equals` method is to return `False` when comparing DataFrames with different block orders but identical content.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function, which might not be able to distinguish between blocks if they have the same dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This results in the incorrect comparison of blocks, leading to a wrong equality determination between two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to a more robust implementation that can differentiate between the blocks effectively.
2. Modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected `equals` function should be able to properly differentiate between blocks by considering the actual block values in addition to the `dtype.name`. This update should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
