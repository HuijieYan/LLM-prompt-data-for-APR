### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances and determines if they are equal by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. If the lengths of their axes are different, it returns `False`. If any axis is not equal, it also returns `False`. Then, it consolidates both `BlockManager` instances and compares their blocks.
   
2. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) which have columns with different data types. The expected result is `False` but the actual result is `True`.

### Error:
The bug lies in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks. Since the blocks in the failing test have different data types in the columns, the equality check `block.equals(oblock)` fails, leading to an incorrect result and causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality comparison of the blocks to account for the possibility of columns with different data types. We should handle the comparison of columns of different types separately to ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Updated equals method of BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block.empty and oblock.empty:
            continue
        if not block.equals(oblock, compare_dtype=False):  # Added compare_dtype parameter
            return False

    return True
```

By adding `compare_dtype=False` to the `equals` method call for blocks, we ensure that the comparison does not take into account the data types of the columns. This will allow the comparison to pass even if the columns have different types.

This correction should address the issue and make the function return the correct result for the failing test case.
