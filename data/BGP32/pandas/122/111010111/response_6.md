### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in place before comparing the blocks within the instances.
2. The buggy function uses the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes, which are supposed to contain the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` where it was expected to return `False`, indicating a bug in the equality checking logic of the function.
4. The GitHub issue indicates incompatibility in the equality check of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function has an issue in comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The sorting of blocks is based on a canonicalization function. The error message occurs because even though the blocks have the same content, they may have different locations due to different iteration orders, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. We should not rely on the order of blocks for comparison, but rather compare the actual content of the blocks. One way to achieve this is to iterate over the blocks and compare their contents directly instead of relying on sorted order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, we directly compare the blocks for equality without relying on their order. This approach should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
