### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The comparison involves checking the axes, consolidating the blocks, and then comparing the blocks. The error occurs when comparing the blocks due to the order being not canonicalized properly.
   
2. The error occurs because the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not canonicalized before comparison. This leads to incorrect comparison results, causing the function to return `True` even when the blocks have a different order.
   
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to compare two different dataframes `df1` and `df2` and assert that they are not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison leads to a false positive result, causing the assertion to fail erroneously.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to canonicalize the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before comparison. This will ensure that the blocks are compared in a consistent and predictable order, preventing false positive results.
   
2. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. This ordering will ensure that even unconsolidated blocks are compared accurately.

### Code Fix:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The above corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the bug by properly canonicalizing the order of blocks before comparison. This fix ensures that the function correctly determines the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
