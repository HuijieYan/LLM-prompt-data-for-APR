### Error Identification and Explanation
1. **Error Location:**
   - The issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
   - The bug arises when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, leading to an incorrect result of `True`.

2. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug occurs due to the comparison of two DataFrame blocks based on their locations rather than their actual contents.
   - When sorting blocks using the `canonicalize` function to check equality in the buggy function, the block locations are considered, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks rather than their locations.
   - Modify the comparison logic between the blocks to check for equality of values within each block, rather than comparing based on locations.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=id)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=id)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version:
- The comparison is based on the content of blocks rather than their locations.
- Blocks are sorted based on their `id`, ensuring equality is based on the data itself.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output of `False` when comparing the provided DataFrames.
