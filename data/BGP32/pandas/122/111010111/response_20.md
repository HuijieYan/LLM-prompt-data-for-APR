### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison between every pair of axes in `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
3. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key function.
4. The comparison between every pair of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect comparisons between the axes and blocks of two different `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`). The code is not properly handling the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations, leading to the incorrect `True` result. The algorithm is currently comparing each block based on its type name and its locations, which may not capture the content similarity between two blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the comparison logic for blocks to focus on content equality rather than location.
2. Use the `Block.equals()` method to compare the blocks' actual content.
3. Maintain the order of blocks unchanged to preserve their original sequence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks for self and other BlockManager
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare every pair of blocks for equality
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        if block1.equals(block2):
            return True
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block_equals(b1, b2) for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected version of the function, comparisons are now based on block content equality rather than location, resolving the bug in the comparison logic.
