### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes, consolidating them in-place, and then comparing the blocks.
3. The failing test is checking the equality of two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, which should return False but is incorrectly returning True.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights a bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. Comparing the length of axes between `self` and `other`.
2. Checking if all the axes between `self` and `other` are equal.
3. Consolidating blocks in-place using `_consolidate_inplace()`.
4. Comparing the number of blocks in `self` and `other`.
5. Sorting the blocks before comparing.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the fact that when comparing blocks for equality, the comparison considers the order of blocks by sorting them using `canonicalize`. If two DataFrames have identical blocks but in a different order, the function incorrectly returns True.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we can modify the equality comparison to properly handle cases where the order of blocks might be different in the two BlockManager instances but the content of the blocks is the same.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create sets of blocks for comparison
    self_set = set(self.blocks)
    other_set = set(other.blocks)

    # Check if both sets are equal
    return self_set == other_set
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly compare the blocks' content without considering their order, thus fixing the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
