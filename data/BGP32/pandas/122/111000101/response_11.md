The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The function is trying to compare blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, but the comparison logic is flawed. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return `False` even when the blocks are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of just comparing the sorted blocks directly, we should compare each block's content based on their dtype and values.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        self_loc, other_loc = self_block.mgr_locs, other_block.mgr_locs
        if not self_loc.equals(other_loc):
            return False
        if not self_block.values.equals(other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the function now correctly compares each block's manager locations and values, ensuring a proper comparison for equality. This should address the bug and make the function return the correct result for the expected cases.
