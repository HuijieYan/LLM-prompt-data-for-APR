The bug in the given function arises from the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue is with the incorrect usage of `as_array` method with `tolist()` for `mgr_locs` within `canonicalize` function. This causes a 'list' object has no attribute 'as_array' error during execution.

To fix this bug, we need to access `mgr_locs` directly without calling `tolist()` since it is already a numpy array. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

With this correction, the buggy function should now work correctly without encountering the 'list' object has no attribute 'as_array' error.
