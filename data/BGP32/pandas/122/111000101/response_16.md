The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug lies in the comparison logic for the blocks. When comparing the blocks, the function is trying to get the `mgr_locs` attribute from the `block` object, which leads to an AttributeError since the `mgr_locs` attribute is not defined in the `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock` class. This causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for how the blocks are compared. We should compare the blocks based on their content rather than trying to access unsupported attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without trying to access the `mgr_locs` attribute. It should now properly compare the content of the blocks and return the correct result for the `equals` function.
