The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block contents. The bug lies in the comparison of blocks in the `canonicalize` function. The current implementation is sorting the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, causing a mismatch as `block` does not have a `mgr_locs` attribute.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their data content. One approach is to concatenate the block's data values into a tuple and use that for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block data content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values.ravel().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their data content, ensuring a proper comparison between the two BlockManager objects.
