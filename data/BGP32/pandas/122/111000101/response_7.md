The bug in the provided function is related to the sorting of blocks before comparing them. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs (BlockPlacement) attributes to ensure a consistent order for comparison. However, the comparison is flawed due to an incorrect implementation in the canonicalize function where mgr_locs is not accessed correctly.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should access the mgr_locs attribute of the block object correctly by calling the attribute directly instead of using `.as_array.tolist()` to convert it to a list. Additionally, a clarification on the expected variable values is provided below.

### Clarification on the expected variable values:
- `block.mgr_locs` is an instance of the BlockPlacement class.
- `block.dtype` returns the dtype of the block.
- `oblock` should be replaced with `other_block` for clarity.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the canonicalize function to access mgr_locs directly.
2. Update the variable names for clarity and consistency.
3. Ensure the sorting and comparison of blocks are done correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the canonicalize function to access mgr_locs correctly and ensuring proper comparison of blocks, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
