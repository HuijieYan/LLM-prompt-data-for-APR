The bug in the provided function `equals` is related to the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of blocks.

The `canonicalize` function converts a block into a tuple with the block's dtype name and its mgr_locs as an array. However, in the buggy code, the `as_array.tolist()` is called on `mgr_locs`, which is not a valid attribute. This causes an AttributeError when trying to run the function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute without trying to call `tolist()` on it. We can simply return the tuple with `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the AttributeError issue and meet the expected input/output values for the failing test execution provided.
