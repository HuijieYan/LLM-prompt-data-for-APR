The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison logic for the `blocks`. The function is trying to compare blocks by first sorting them based on their data type and memory locations. However, the comparison is incorrect due to not considering the correct attributes of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the blocks. Instead of comparing based on the data type and memory locations, we should compare based on the data within the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting them first, ensuring that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their attributes. This should fix the bug in the function.
