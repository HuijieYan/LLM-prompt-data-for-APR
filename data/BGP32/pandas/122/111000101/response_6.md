The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The main issue in the buggy function is with the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, where it tries to sort blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, but the `mgr_locs` may not be directly comparable leading to incorrect sorting.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple consisting of `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. The issue arises because `mgr_locs` is an instance of `BlockPlacement` which may not directly compare types, leading to incorrect sorting.
3. This incorrect sorting can result in mismatched blocks being compared which leads to the function returning incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the comparison is accurate and does not rely on the `mgr_locs` in a way that may lead to inconsistent comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We modified the `canonicalize` function to use `str(block.dtype)` and `block.values.tostring()` for more accurate and consistent comparison.
- This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their actual content for a reliable comparison.
- The corrected version should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances and provide correct results based on the content of the blocks.
