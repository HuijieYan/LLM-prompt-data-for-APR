The bug in the provided function is related to the comparison logic between two BlockManager instances. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of Block objects while sorting and comparing them.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager instances, `self` and `other`, by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs in the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple of block dtype name and mgr_locs representation. This tuple is used to determine the order of blocks while comparing.
3. The issue arises because the `block` object in the `canonicalize` function does not have an attribute named `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. It results in an AttributeError in the sorting process.
4. Thus, the function fails to correctly sort and compare the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype name and mgr_locs representation from the Block object.
2. Ensure that the `block` object in the `canonicalize` function has the necessary attributes for comparison.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now correctly extracts the block's dtype and mgr_locs attributes to create the tuple for sorting. This modification should fix the sorting issue and ensure the correct comparison between the two BlockManager instances.
