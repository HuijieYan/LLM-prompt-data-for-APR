The buggy function compares two instances of the BlockManager class based on their axes and blocks. It aims to check if the internal data structures are equal. The bug arises when the function attempts to compare the blocks within the BlockManager instances without considering their order.

The cause of the bug is that the function sorts the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize`, without taking into account the actual content within each block. This can lead to incorrect comparisons between blocks that have the same dtype name and manager locations but contain different data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparisons between blocks consider their actual data content, not just their dtype and manager locations.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if set(self.blocks.keys()) != set(other.blocks.keys()):
        return False

    for block_key in self.blocks:
        if not self.blocks[block_key].equals(other.blocks[block_key]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the keys of the blocks (which represents the dtype and manager locations) to ensure that they match between the two instances. Then, we iterate over each block and compare them directly using the `equals` method of the block, which correctly considers the data content within each block.

This fix ensures that the comparison between two BlockManager instances is done accurately, taking into consideration all the internal blocks and their data content.
