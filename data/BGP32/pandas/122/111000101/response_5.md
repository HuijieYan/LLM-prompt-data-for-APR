### Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects to check if they have the same length and if each pair of corresponding axes is equal.
- It then consolidates the blocks of both objects in place before comparing the number of blocks.
- Finally, it sorts the blocks based on a canonical key and compares each pair of blocks for equality.

### Bug
The bug in the code lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is called. This is incorrect because `mgr_locs` is an attribute of the `IntBlock` class and not directly accessible from the `Block` interface.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to access the `mgr_locs` attribute from the correct block type. Since we're iterating over a list of blocks, we need to handle different block types (e.g., `IntBlock`, `ObjectBlock`). We can create a more generic approach to handle this by checking the type of the block and then accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported block type")

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
