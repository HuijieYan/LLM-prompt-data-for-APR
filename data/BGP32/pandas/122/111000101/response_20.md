The buggy function is attempting to compare two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`) to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes, consolidates the objects in place, checks the number of blocks, and then compares each block one by one.

The bug in the function is with the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks for comparison based on their dtype and manager locations. The issue lies in the way `mgr_locs` is accessed. 

To fix the bug, we should update the canonicalize function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute as an array before converting it to a list. The correct way to access `mgr_locs` is `block.mgr_locs.as_array`. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `canonicalize` function retrieves the manager locations correctly and should fix the bug.
