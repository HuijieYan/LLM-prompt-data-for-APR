The buggy function is trying to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within each instance.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function extracts information about the blocks to create a tuple for sorting. It seems that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object is accessed incorrectly in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, we should correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute when creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function. Additionally, we need to properly handle the sorting of block objects based on their attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.block_type, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `block.block_type` and `block.mgr_locs` to create the tuple for sorting the blocks. This modification ensures that the sorting is based on the correct attributes of the block objects.
