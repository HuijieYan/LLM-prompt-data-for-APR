## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal by iterating over their `blocks`. However, the comparison logic is flawed as it does not consider the block order and potential unconsolidated blocks that may exist. The function sorts the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects using a custom `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple of block type name and block locations. The comparisons are then made using the sorted blocks, but the `canonicalize` function uses `as_array.tolist()` on `mgr_locs` which returns a list representation of the locations instead of the original `BlockPlacement` object. This mismatch causes the comparison to fail even if the blocks are equal.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `canonicalize` function returns the correct tuple for comparison, considering the actual `BlockPlacement` object instead of a list representation. This can be achieved by directly using the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block without converting it to a list.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the `mgr_locs` directly within the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks correctly. Now the function should be able to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their blocks' content regardless of the order or consolidation of the blocks.
