### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks by their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute, but the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly, causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly as `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which will cause an AttributeError because `mgr_locs` is not an attribute of the `block` object.

2. This incorrect access of `mgr_locs` prevents the sorting of blocks and subsequently the comparison of corresponding blocks between the two BlockManager instances. As a result, the function fails to correctly determine if the BlockManager instances are equal.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the attributes needed for sorting the blocks.
2. Correctly extract the required attributes from the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then location for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type name and values, allowing for a correct comparison between the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances.
