The buggy function is the `equals()` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks.

There are several potential error locations in the function:
1. The comparison of axes may not work properly due to the usage of the `equals()` method, which might not be implemented correctly.
2. The sorting of blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize()` might cause issues if the function does not return predictable results.
3. The comparison of individual blocks for equality might fail if the `equals()` method for blocks is not implemented correctly.

The bug in the function arises due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize()` function. The `canonicalize()` function is supposed to return a tuple of block type name and the block's locations, but the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call seems incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `canonicalize()` function returns a proper tuple. The `mgr_locs` attribute should be accessed directly without the `as_array.tolist()` function call, as it seems unnecessary and could lead to unexpected results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function returns a tuple with the block type's name and its `mgr_locs` without unnecessary conversions. This should resolve the bug in the function.
