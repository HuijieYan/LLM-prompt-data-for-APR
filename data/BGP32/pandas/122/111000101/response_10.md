The cause of the bug in the provided function is related to the `canonicalize` function that sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on certain criteria. The issue arises when trying to access the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array` attributes of the `block`. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `block` object is correctly accessed when calling the `canonicalize` function. Additionally, the `mgr_locs` attribute should be accessed directly instead of potentially incorrectly trying to convert it to a list using `as_array`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version directly converts the `block.dtype` to a string and keeps `block.mgr_locs` as is without trying to convert it further. This should address the issue and provide the expected behavior in the function.
