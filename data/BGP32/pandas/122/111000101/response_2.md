## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates both instances in place, sorts the blocks based on dtype name and location, and finally compares each block between the two instances.

The bug occurs during the comparison of blocks because the canonicalization process of blocks produces incorrect results due to a misinterpretation of block attributes.

## Bug
The bug arises from the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call in the `canonicalize` function. The attribute `mgr_locs` of the `block` object is not intended to be converted directly to a list, resulting in improper canonicalization of blocks.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should revise the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent the block's properties without converting `mgr_locs` inappropriately. Instead, we can utilize the block's essential attributes for comparison.

## Updated Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This revised version of the `equals` function correctly compares `BlockManager` instances considering the essential attributes of blocks for sorting and equality checks. The bug related to incorrect conversion of `mgr_locs` has been addressed.
