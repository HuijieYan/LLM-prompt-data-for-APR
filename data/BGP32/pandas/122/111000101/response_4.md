The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue is that `mgr_locs` is not an attribute of the `block` object. Additionally, there are some missing attributes and methods from the `BlockManager` class that are needed for the function to work correctly.

To fix the bug and make sure the function satisfies the expected input/output values, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use information available from the `block` object itself. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly creates a tuple with the type of the block object and its values. This change ensures that the function can compare the blocks correctly based on type and data, satisfying the expected input/output values provided in the test case.
