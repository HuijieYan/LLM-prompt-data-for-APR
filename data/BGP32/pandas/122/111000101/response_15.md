The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples, where the blocks are not being properly sorted based on a canonical order before comparison.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to create a function that generates a canonical representation for each block based on the block's data type (dtype.name) and its location (mgr_locs). This canonicalization function should be used to sort the blocks before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuple())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple representing the block based on its dtype name and mgr_locs. The blocks are then sorted using this function before comparison. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared in a consistent order, preventing the bug in the original function.
