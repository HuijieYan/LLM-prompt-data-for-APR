The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The function is meant to return True if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal and False otherwise. The issue with the buggy function arises from the sorting of blocks before comparison.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on block type (`dtype.name`) and block locations (`mgr_locs`), but the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly using `as_array.tolist()` instead of `as_array.tolist`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `tolist` method on `mgr_locs`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the access of `as_array` attribute without calling `tolist()` on it.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
    
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks, returning True if they are equal and False otherwise.
