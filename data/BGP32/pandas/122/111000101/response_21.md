The bug in the function is likely related to the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager instances. The function attempts to compare the blocks by sorting them based on their dtype name and manager locations, but the implementation of the `canonicalize` function may not be correct.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly extracts the dtype name and manager locations of a block. Additionally, we should properly handle the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager instances.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version should now handle the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager instances correctly, according to the expected input/output values provided.
