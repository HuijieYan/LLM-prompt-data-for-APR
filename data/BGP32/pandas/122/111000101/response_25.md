## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
2. The bug occurs when trying to generate a canonicalized form of the blocks using a `canonicalize` function.
3. The error is likely due to the way `canonicalize` function handles the `mgr_locs` attribute of `block`.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the canonicalize function to correctly handle `mgr_locs`.
5. Based on the expected values and types provided, a corrected version of the function is presented below.

## Corrected version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, the buggy function should now work as expected for the provided test cases.
