### Bugs in the provided function

1. The function `equals(self, other)` is defining the parameters `self` and `other`, which are instance variables of the class `BlockManager`. This is causing confusion as `self` is usually a reserved keyword in Python to refer to the current instance of a class. It is recommended to change the parameter name `self` to `self_block_manager` or similar to avoid confusion with the `self` referencing the current instance of the class.

2. In the `canonicalize(block)` function, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` will cause an AttributeError because `mgr_locs` may not have the `as_array` method. It appears that `mgr_locs` is an attribute and it needs to be accessed correctly to get the desired value.

### Fixing the bug

1. Change the parameter name `self` to something that doesn't conflict with the reserved keyword. In the following corrected version, `self` is replaced with `self_block_manager`.

2. Access the correct attribute in the `canonicalize(block)` function to avoid the AttributeError.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self_block_manager, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self_block_manager.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_block_manager._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self_block_manager.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, getattr(block.mgr_locs, 'value', None))

    self_blocks = sorted(self_block_manager.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the parameter `self` is replaced with `self_block_manager`, and the `canonicalize(block)` function accesses the attribute correctly. These changes should resolve the bugs in the original function.
