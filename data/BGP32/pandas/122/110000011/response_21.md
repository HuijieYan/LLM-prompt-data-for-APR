## Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not functioning correctly. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking the equality of their axes and blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. However, the issue mentioned on GitHub states that the method wrongly returns True even when the blocks are identical but with different locations.

## Error location:
The error is likely in the `equals` method during the comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method checks for exact equality of the blocks without considering the possibility of blocks being identical but residing at different locations in the data structure.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider blocks as equal even if they are at different locations but contain the same data. We should compare the content of the blocks instead of their exact locations.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        # Compare blocks based on content rather than exact location
        return block.values.equals(oblock.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` method compares the blocks based on their content (`values`) rather than their exact locations. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.
