### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. 
2. The function uses the `equals` method of the axes and blocks, so the issue might lie within those methods.
3. The GitHub issue reports that the `DataFrame.equals()` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with the same values but different locations. This suggests a problem with comparing blocks based on their location.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the data values themselves rather than the locations of the blocks.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b.dtypes)  # Sort blocks by data types
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b.dtypes)  # Sort other blocks by data types

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified version of the `equals` function now compares the values within the blocks instead of their locations. Sorting the blocks by data types ensures that we compare similar data types accurately. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and return correct results when comparing DataFrames with the same values but different locations.
