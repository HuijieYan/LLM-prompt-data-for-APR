## Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The bug described in the GitHub issue indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` even in cases where the blocks have identical data but are located differently.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function.
3. Canonicalize function returning (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for comparison.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function only considers the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` for comparison while sorting the blocks. This sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` leads to blocks with identical data but different locations being treated as different, resulting in the function incorrectly returning `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing the blocks, we consider all the necessary attributes that determine equality. One approach could involve modifying the `canonicalize` function to include more detailed information about the blocks for accurate comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        pd.DataFrame(block.values).equals(pd.DataFrame(oblock.values)) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the `values` in addition to `mgr_locs` for comparison. This change ensures that blocks with identical data (values) will be correctly identified as equal, even if they are located differently.
