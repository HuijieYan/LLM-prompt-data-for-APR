### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The bug is related to incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug is caused by the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function, which compares blocks based on their type name and manager locations. Since the sorting order can change the position of blocks, it can result in incorrect equality comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks directly without changing their order based on type name and manager locations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without changing their order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without reordering them based on type name and manager locations, we ensure that the equality comparison reflects the actual data and location of the blocks correctly. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the `equals` function incorrectly returned `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
