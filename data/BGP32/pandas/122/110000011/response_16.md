The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks by their dtype name and manager locations, which can result in incorrect equalities if the blocks have the same data but different locations. This issue was reported on GitHub where the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `equals` function to compare the actual block data instead of just their dtype name and manager locations. By comparing the block data itself, we ensure that the equality check is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their positions.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Comparing block data instead of just dtype name and manager locations
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the actual block data using the `values` attribute of each block, ensuring that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
