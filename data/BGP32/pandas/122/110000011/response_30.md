### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function falsely returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The bug stems from the comparison of blocks where the order of blocks is not considered, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner before comparing them.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks consistently before comparing
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now includes sorting the blocks using a consistent key (combination of dtype name and mgr_locs) before comparison. This ensures that blocks are compared in a deterministic manner, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
