### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure for implementing `DataFrame`, `Series`, etc. in Pandas.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug seems to be due to incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is because the blocks are sorted based on their data type and locations without considering the actual content.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of just their order and locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This happens because the function sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations (`mgr_locs`), but it should compare the content of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks by data type and location, we should compare the actual content of the blocks to determine their equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the content of each block using the `equals` method. This ensures that the equality check is based on the actual data within the blocks, rather than just their order and locations.
