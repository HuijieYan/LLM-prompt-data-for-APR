### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class that is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axes lengths.
2. The comparison of axes using `equals` method.
3. Sorting and comparing blocks based on their dtype name and location.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the naive comparison of block locations in the `equals` method. It doesn't handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations, leading to false positives in the equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the structure and content of the blocks rather than solely focusing on their locations. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic and ensuring that blocks with identical data are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare blocks based on dtype and values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_values(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_block_values = [block_values(block) for block in self_blocks]
    other_block_values = [block_values(block) for block in other_blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_val, oblock_val)
        for block_val, oblock_val in zip(self_block_values, other_block_values)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the data stored in the blocks rather than their locations, ensuring that the equality check is accurate even when blocks are at different locations but contain the same data.
