### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. This causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks are identical but have different locations.
3. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the equality comparison to check for block content equality without considering the block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison in the `equals` function to directly compare block values instead of sorting blocks based on dtype and locations.
2. Update the comparison logic to iterate through each block and compare them without considering their locations or dtype.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data)
        for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We extract the block values from each block using `block.values`.
- We compare the block values directly using `np.array_equal` to check for equality.
- This change ensures that the comparison is based on block content rather than dtype and locations.
