### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then checking if their blocks are equal or not.
- The reported GitHub issue mentions that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in cases where the blocks have identical data but are in different locations.

### Potential error locations:
1. Comparison of axes to determine equality.
2. Consolidation of blocks in place before comparison.
3. Sorting the blocks based on block information.
4. Comparison of the blocks.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug most likely occurs because the function is not handling scenarios where blocks have identical data but different locations. When comparing the blocks, the function is not taking into account the block locations. This leads to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic between blocks. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we should consider the block data along with the block locations to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering block data and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the blocks based on both data and locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize()` function to consider both block data and block locations, the corrected version of the `equals()` function should now accurately determine equality of two `BlockManager` instances, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
