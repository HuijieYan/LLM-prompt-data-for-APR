### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
- The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations but identical content, leading to an incorrect result.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparing them, but it may not be handling cases where identical blocks have different locations.

### Error location:
- The error seems to occur in the `canonicalize` function, where the comparison of blocks is not handling the scenario where identical blocks have different locations.

### Bug cause:
- The bug is caused due to the fact that the `canonicalize` function does not take into account the potential difference in block locations for identical blocks.
- This can lead to cases where the blocks are actually equal but are compared incorrectly due to different locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison mechanism used in the `canonicalize` function considers the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.
- We can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual content of the blocks in addition to their type and location.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Function to compare blocks by content
        def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
            if block.equals(oblock):
                return True
            else:
                # Check if content is equal even if the blocks are at different locations
                return block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        
        # Canonicalize block order, considering type, location, and content
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (
                block.dtype.name, 
                block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
                block.values.values # consider the content of the block
            )
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Now, the corrected `equals` function will compare blocks based on their type, location, and content, ensuring an accurate comparison between the `BlockManager` instances.
