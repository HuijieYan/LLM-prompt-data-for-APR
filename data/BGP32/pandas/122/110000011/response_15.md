## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of Pandas core internals.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem when calling `equals` method on two DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.

## Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is prone to issues as it checks for equality without considering block locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function, used for sorting blocks, ignores the block locations and only considers the dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not take into account that identical blocks in different locations should not be considered equal. The comparison only on dtype and mgr_locs in the `canonicalize` function leads to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison. Additionally, we need to adjust the equality check between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to consider both dtype and locations of the block.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and np.all(block.mgr_locs.as_array == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added the comparison of block locations in addition to dtype names in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that identical blocks in different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal. The comparison of block locations is now included in the final check between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
