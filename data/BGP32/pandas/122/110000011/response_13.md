### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their attributes. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrame blocks with identical values but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Using the `equals` method inside a generator expression.
3. Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.
4. Comparing the equality of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not take into account the different locations of blocks within the DataFrame instances while comparing them for equality. When blocks have identical values but different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block values in addition to the block type and location. This way, blocks with the same values in different locations will be considered as different, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, values,
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block values, the `equals` function will now correctly identify DataFrame blocks with identical values but different locations as different, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
