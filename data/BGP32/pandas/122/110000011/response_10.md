Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to compare blocks based on their content rather than their locations. This can be achieved by iterating through the blocks and comparing their content.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks to ensure comparison based on content
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not location
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.content_equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we have added a loop to iterate through the blocks of `self` and `other` and compare their content using the `content_equals` method (which should be implemented in the `Block` class for actual comparison of block content). This ensures that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations.
