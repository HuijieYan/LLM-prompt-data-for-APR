## Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to determine if two BlockManager objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the method that causes it to return True incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential error locations:
1. Comparison of axes lengths.
2. Comparison of axes via `equals` method.
3. Sorting and comparing blocks.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the method does not account for identical blocks with different locations. When comparing the blocks, the method may consider them unequal due to differences in their order even though their contents are the same.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to check if the blocks are equal in content rather than by their order. This can involve comparing the values within each block directly.

## Corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the values within each block using `np.array_equal()` to check for equality. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
