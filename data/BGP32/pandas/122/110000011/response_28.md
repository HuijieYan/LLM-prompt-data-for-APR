### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block within the objects.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that `equals()` wrongly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This indicates that the comparison logic within the function is flawed.

### Potential Error Location:
- The comparison logic within the `equals()` function where it compares each block of `self` and `other`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. The function does not take into account the block locations when comparing the blocks, resulting in False negatives.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to consider the block locations when comparing blocks to ensure that blocks with different locations are not considered identical.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # Include block location in comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize()` function now includes the block location (`.tobytes()`) in the comparison, ensuring that blocks with different locations are not considered equal during the comparison.

By updating the comparison logic to include the block locations, the `equals()` function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations and return the expected result.
