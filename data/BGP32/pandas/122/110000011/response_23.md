## Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `equals` function is due to the fact that it incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this problem with an example where two DataFrames with identical values but different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks for comparison only considers the dtype name and the location of the block. In cases where two blocks have the same values but are located at different positions in the DataFrame, they should not be considered equal.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to take into account the values of the blocks, in addition to the dtype name and location. By comparing the values of the blocks along with the dtype and location, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously considered equal.

## Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `block.values` as part of the tuple for comparison. This change ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal when comparing DataFrames.
