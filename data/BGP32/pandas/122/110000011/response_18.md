### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks within two different instances using block order and block content. The bug occurs when identical blocks exist in different locations, causing the comparison to return True incorrectly when it should return False.

### Identified Error:
The bug is located in the `equals` function where block equality is checked without considering block locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks without considering their locations. When the same block exists in different locations in two instances, the function incorrectly returns True, causing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison approach of blocks based on their content considering their locations. By incorporating block locations into the comparison logic, we can ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check block equality considering block locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check on block locations along with block content comparison to ensure that identical blocks in different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
