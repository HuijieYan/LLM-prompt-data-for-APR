### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The issue reported on GitHub states that the `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` when it should return `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be in how the comparison of blocks is done. It may be failing to compare blocks with different locations correctly, leading to a false positive result.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve ensuring that the comparison of blocks is done accurately by taking into account not just the content but also the locations of the blocks.

### Correction:
To correct the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on both their types and locations. Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now includes the block's locations by converting them to a string. This ensures that the comparison takes into account both the block type and location, which should correctly handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.
