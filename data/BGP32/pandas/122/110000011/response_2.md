### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is within the `BlockManager` class.
- The GitHub issue points out that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The issue provides a code sample that when `df3.equals(df4)` is called, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` function.
2. Sorting and comparison of blocks may not be taking location into account.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares blocks without considering their locations. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, which is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to take into account not only the content of the blocks, but also their respective locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks based on both content and location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: (canonicalize(b), b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: (canonicalize(b), b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue reported on GitHub by correctly comparing identical blocks with different locations and returning the expected result.
