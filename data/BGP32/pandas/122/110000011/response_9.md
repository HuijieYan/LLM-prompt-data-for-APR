## Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking the axes and blocks. The bug reported in the GitHub issue suggests that the function is not handling identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to a false positive result.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing axes for equality.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks for equality.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not take into account the different block locations when comparing the blocks for equality. The sorting of blocks based on the type name and manager locations doesn't consider the possibility of identical blocks being at different locations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. This can be achieved by comparing the actual block data for equality instead of relying on the block sorting method.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare each block individually for equality, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
