### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. However, it fails to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Identified Error Location:
- The issue lies in the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function. It doesn't consider the case when the blocks have the same content but distinct locations, thus leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused due to the sorting of blocks based on the combination of the block's data type name and its locations. This sorting operation can lead to mismatched blocks being considered equal when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This results in the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to eliminate the sorting of blocks based on both the data type name and the manager locations. Instead, we should focus on comparing the content of the blocks directly to ensure accurate results when determining if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By removing the block canonicalization process based on both data type name and locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function now directly compares the content of the blocks. This change ensures that the function accurately identifies differences in block locations, providing the correct comparison results.
