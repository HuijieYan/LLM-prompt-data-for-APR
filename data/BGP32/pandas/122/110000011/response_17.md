### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
2. The sorting of blocks based on the canonicalize function may not handle blocks with the same content but different locations correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the block locations. If two identical blocks are in different locations within the BlockManager objects, the current implementation will consider them as not equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations. We should ensure that identical blocks are detected as equal regardless of their internal locations within the BlockManager objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: str(sorted(block.values.to_list())))

    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `sort_blocks` function is introduced to sort the blocks based on their content (values) before comparison. This way, identical blocks with different locations will be compared correctly and the `equals` function will return the expected result as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
