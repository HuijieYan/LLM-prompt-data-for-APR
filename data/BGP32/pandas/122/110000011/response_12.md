## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential Error Location:
The error likely occurs in the logic that compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Specifically, the issue lies in the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly identifying blocks with identical content but different locations. This results in the function `equals` returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

## Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. By correctly identifying and comparing the blocks irrespective of their locations, the `equals` function will return the expected result.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version takes into account the content of the blocks as well as their locations when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
