## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a case where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing blocks to consider only the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- Instead of sorting blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, blocks are sorted based on the bytes representation of their values.
- This change ensures that the comparison between blocks considers only the content of the blocks, ignoring their locations.

By applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly identify DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal.
