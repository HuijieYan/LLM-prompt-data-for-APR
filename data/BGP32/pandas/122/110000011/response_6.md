### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the class. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function might be flawed.
2. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks could be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared in the function. When sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, the comparison might not be taking into account the different locations of the blocks, leading to an incorrect `True` return value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the block locations as well. One possible approach is to enhance the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting process. This way, blocks with different locations but identical content will not be mistakenly considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version includes a more detailed comparison using the block locations in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
