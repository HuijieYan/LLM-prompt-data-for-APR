### Analysis:
- The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating the data, sorting the blocks, and finally comparing each block. 
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The comparison of axes may not be sufficient to identify differences in the internal block data.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks may not account for cases where blocks are identical but located in different positions.

### Cause of the bug:
The primary cause of the bug is that the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the blocks correctly, leading to a false positive when block locations differ.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic in the `equals` function to not only look at the axes but also compare the blocks themselves without being affected by their positions.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))  # Sort blocks for comparison
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version sorts the blocks based on their string representation before comparing them.
- Sorting the blocks eliminates the issue related to different block locations when the blocks themselves are identical.
- This approach ensures that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as equal, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
