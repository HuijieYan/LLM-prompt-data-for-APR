## Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks from two instances and incorrectly returning `True` when the blocks are identical but have different locations. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior and leads to incorrect results when checking for equality between two DataFrames.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The function combines the block's data type name and its `mgr_locs` attribute (which indicates the block's location) to create a tuple key for sorting. When blocks are identical in content but have different locations, they are treated as different blocks due to this sorting method.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations. This causes the equality check to fail when it should return `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's data type name for sorting, ignoring the location information. This way, blocks that are identical in content will be considered equal regardless of their locations.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function only returns the data type name of the block. This change ensures that blocks with the same content are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their locations.
