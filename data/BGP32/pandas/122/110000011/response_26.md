### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The issue on GitHub highlights a scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug is caused by the way the `canonicalize` function handles sorting of blocks based on block type and locations, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal during the comparison.


### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the fixed version:
1. We modified the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on a hash of their values and the locations of their managers.
2. This change ensures that while comparing blocks, the differences in locations will be considered, solving the issue reported on GitHub.
3. Now, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should correctly handle comparisons of two `BlockManager` objects based on their blocks and locations.
