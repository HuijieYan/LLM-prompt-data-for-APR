## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is part of the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
- The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The bug arises from the way that the blocks are compared and possibly due to inconsistent sorting or representation of the blocks.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` might not handle cases where blocks with identical data have different locations (e.g., within the `mgr_locs` attribute).
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` might not account for all possible variations in block comparison.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison logic within the `equals` function, which depends on the sorted order of blocks that might not properly handle cases where identical blocks have different internal locations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to compare blocks more robustly, considering potential variations in block locations.
2. Ensure that the sorting mechanism used to order the blocks for comparison accounts for all relevant attributes that differentiate the blocks.
3. Add additional checks to handle cases where blocks are identical in content but differ in internal representation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now includes the `values` attribute of the block to differentiate blocks more accurately.
- The `mgr_locs` attribute is converted to bytes for a more deterministic order.
- Blocks are compared based on both `values` and `mgr_locs` to handle cases where block locations differ.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly handled in the comparison process.
