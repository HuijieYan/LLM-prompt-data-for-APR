### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function checks if the axes are equal, consolidate the blocks in place for both objects, and then compare the individual blocks for equality.
   
2. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with mismatched values in columns, which should return `False` when compared for equality using the `equals` method.
   
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because the result of the comparison was `True`, which means that `df1` and `df2` were considered equal when they should not have been.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method implementation is that it doesn't handle the case where the values contained in the blocks are not equal. The function first checks the lengths of the axes and the consolidation status of the blocks, but it assumes that if these conditions pass, the two `BlockManager` objects are equal without considering the contents of the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the equality checking logic in the `equals` method. After doing the preliminary checks for axes and blocks, we need to compare the contents of each block in a pairwise manner to verify the equality of the `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` method, the function now compares the contents of each block in the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the function accurately determines equality based on both the structure and values of the blocks. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
