### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by comparing their `axes` and `blocks`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two data frames with different values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method. The assertion fails with an error.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `assert True is False`. This implies that the `equals` method is returning True when it should have returned False.
   
### Bug:
- The bug in the `equals` method arises from the way it is comparing blocks for equality. It fails to properly compare the underlying data within blocks to determine equality.

### Fix:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract and compare the block data for equality.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to compare block data correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare block data for equality
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.recursive_data.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By comparing the block data properly in the `canonicalize` function and modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` method, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
