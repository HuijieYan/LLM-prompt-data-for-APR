### 1. Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
- The `equals` method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file asserts that two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) are not equal, using the `equals` method. This test fails with an assertion error.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returns True instead of False. This suggests that the `equals` method implementation in the `BlockManager` class is incorrect.
- The potential error in the `equals` method lies in the comparison logic between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes.

### 2. Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks of data within the two `BlockManager` instances. The incorrect comparison logic leads to the wrong evaluation of equality, causing the failing test.

### 3. Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is correct. We should compare corresponding blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances and ensure that they are equal.

### 4. Bug Fix and Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    # ensure blocks are sorted for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Conclusion
The corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class adds sorting of blocks based on type and manager locations for comparison. This ensures that corresponding blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are compared correctly. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
