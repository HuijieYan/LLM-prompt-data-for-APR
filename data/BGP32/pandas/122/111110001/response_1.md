### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the equality of two DataFrames by sorting the blocks and then checking the equality of each corresponding block. The bug lies in the comparison logic implemented inside the `equals` function. The comparison logic should take into account the values within each block while considering their order and structure.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy `equals` function is comparing the blocks by sorting them and then checking their equality, but it doesn't consider the actual values within those blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in columns 'a' and 'b', expecting them to be not equal. However, the buggy `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` due to the flawed comparison logic.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to check the equality of values within each block directly.
2. Ensure that the comparison takes into account both the label structure and the content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False

        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
``` 

### Correction Details:
1. The corrected version directly compares the shape and values of each block between the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. If the shape or values of any block differ, it immediately returns `False`.
3. By iterating over the blocks and checking their shapes and values, we ensure a comprehensive comparison.

By using this revised logic, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly assess the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their blocks.
