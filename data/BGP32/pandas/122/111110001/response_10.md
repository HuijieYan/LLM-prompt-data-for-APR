### Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
- The test function fails because it is comparing two DataFrames that are not equal.
- The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects under the hood but incorrectly. The main issue lies in the comparison logic where the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects are being sorted based on a method `canonicalize` that converts the block to a tuple of the dtype name and the manager locations as a list.
- The incorrect order of columns from the DataFrame leads to the erroneous comparison.

### Bug Cause
- The bug arises from the fact that the DataFrame columns should be compared based on their position and not on their respective data types.
- The incorrect comparison logic results in the `equals` method returning `True` even though the DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix
- To correct the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the block labels or columns.
- The modified `canonicalize` function should return a tuple of the block labels rather than the data type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using the block labels
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects based on the block labels. This change will make the comparison logic more robust and responsive to the actual DataFrame data rather than just data types.
