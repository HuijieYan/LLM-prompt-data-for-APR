## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is using an incorrect comparison method to check if two DataFrames are equal.
2. The error is originating from comparing the DataFrames block by block, where the block order is being compared along with the block content which results in incorrect behavior.
3. The failing test is checking if two DataFrames with different values are equal, which should return `False`. However, due to the incorrect block comparison in the `equals` function, the assertion fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the DataFrames as a whole, rather than comparing them block by block.

## Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Comparing DataFrames directly rather than block by block
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

In this corrected version, we compare the values of the DataFrames directly using the `equals` method. This will correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal based on their values rather than their blocks.
