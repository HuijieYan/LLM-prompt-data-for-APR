### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is checking if two block managers are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The test function is creating two DataFrames with different data and asserting that they are not equal using the `equals` function.
3. The error message shows that the assertion failed, indicating that the two DataFrames are incorrectly identified as equal.
4. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic within the `equals` function, likely due to how blocks are being handled and compared.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the comparison logic in the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks of the block managers.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._consolidate().x._values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block._equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))

```

After correcting the `equals` function, it should now compare DataFrames correctly and pass the failing test.
