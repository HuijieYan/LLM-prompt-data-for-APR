## Analysis
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` class for equality. 
- The function checks if the number of axes (dimensions) of the two instances is equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks of data within the instances. 
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances (which internally use `BlockManager`) is failing when checking for equality.

## Potential Errors
1. The comparison of axes may not be accurate.
2. The consolidation of blocks may not be functioning correctly.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks may have issues.

## Cause of the Bug
- The bug most likely arises due to incorrect comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances being compared for equality.
- The incorrect comparison could be related to the way blocks are consolidated, sorted, or compared within the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- We need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
- Ensure that the data blocks are properly sorted and compared.
- Debug and test each step of the function to identify the specific issue and fix it accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.to_numpy())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to use `get_values()` and proper comparison methods, we can compare the blocks accurately and fix the bug.
