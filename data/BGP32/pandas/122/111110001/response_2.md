### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if the axes, blocks, and data within the blocks are equal.
   
2. The function uses methods like `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` to prepare the blocks for comparison.

3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `pd.DataFrame` objects with columns and values in different order, and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing and shows the incorrect comparison that is causing the issue.

### Identifying potential errors

1. The comparison of blocks in the `equals` method might not be considering all aspects that define equality between blocks.
   
2. The sorting of blocks might not be aligning them correctly for comparison.
   
3. Inconsistent handling of block types and locations might affect the equality check.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the method of comparing blocks in the `equals` function. Since the `DataFrame` objects in the failing test have columns with values in different order, the existing comparison mechanism is unable to handle this mismatch correctly, leading to a false positive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison mechanism in the `equals` function to consider not just the block objects themselves, but also the contents of the blocks to ensure proper alignment of the data for comparison.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False

    # Perform inplace consolidation before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize blocks and sort for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_dict(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if all corresponding blocks are equal
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- The comparison now checks if the axes are the same in both `BlockManager` objects.
- Blocks are sorted based on a canonicalization method that considers block data types and values.
- The comparison of blocks now includes checking the equality of block contents.

This corrected version ensures a more robust comparison between `BlockManager` objects, including the sorting and alignment of blocks for a proper equality check.
