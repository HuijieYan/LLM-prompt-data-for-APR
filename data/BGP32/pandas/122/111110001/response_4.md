### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes, consolidating inplace, and then comparing blocks based on their type name and manager locations.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns `'a'` and `'b'`, but the values in corresponding columns are of different types. The test then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion failed because `True` is not equal to `False`, and it provides details about the dataframes being compared.
4. The bug in the `equals` function is that it does not consider the data types of values in the blocks while comparing for equality.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to include checking for the data types of values in the blocks during comparison.

### Correction:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

By adding a proper check within the loop for comparing blocks, we ensure that the data types are also considered during the comparison for equality. This correction should address the bug and make the test pass successfully.
