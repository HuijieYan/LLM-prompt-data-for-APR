### Analysis
- The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
- The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with mismatched values for columns and then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`.
- The error message indicates that the assertion failed because `True` was not equal to `False`.
- This error is occurring because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause
- The bug in the `equals` method arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.
- The method mistakenly checks the equality of each block directly instead of comparing their contents.
- This leads to incorrect results, as blocks may be equal in structure but have different values.

### Fix Strategy
- The fix involves modifying the comparison logic to compare the data inside the blocks instead of comparing the blocks directly.
- To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the blocks in each `BlockManager` instance and compare the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method now compares the values within each block of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the equality check is based on the actual data contents. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
