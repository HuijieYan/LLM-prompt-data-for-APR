### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values and expects them to not be equal. The test fails because the `equals` method within `BlockManager` is returning `True`.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` method.
5. The current implementation of the `equals` method doesn't handle the comparison of blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy
1. Revise the logic for comparing blocks within the `equals` method to ensure correct comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check equality of each block
    for block_label in self.blocks:
        if block_label not in other.blocks:
            return False
        current_block = self.blocks[block_label]
        other_block = other.blocks[block_label]
        if not current_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With the corrected `equals` method, the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors. This method ensures correct comparison of blocks and handles the equality check between two `BlockManager` objects properly.
