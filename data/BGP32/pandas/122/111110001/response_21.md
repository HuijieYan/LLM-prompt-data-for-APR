### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects, specifically comparing the blocks within them.
2. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement in the test is failing, suggesting that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects. They are sorted differently in each BlockManager object which leads to the comparison returning `True` incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in a consistent manner.
5. We can achieve this by creating a custom sorting key that maintains the original order of the blocks in a consistent way.


### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a custom sorting key for blocks to maintain consistency
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_block_type(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use a custom sorting key `canonicalize` that combines the block type and the locations of blocks. This ensures a consistent sorting order for the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which should now fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
