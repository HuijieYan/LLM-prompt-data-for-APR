1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function. This function is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two instances are equal. If not, it returns False.

2. Potential error locations in the `equals` function:
   - The function compares the blocks of `self` and `other` instances without checking if the number of blocks is the same.
   - The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on particular properties, but it may not be implemented correctly, leading to incorrect block comparison.
   - The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method may not be accurate.

3. The cause of the bug in the `equals` function:
   - The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two pandas DataFrames with columns in different order and values interchanged. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal. However, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not handle this case properly, leading to incorrect equality comparison.
   - The error message shows the comparison of the DataFrames where `assert True is False`, indicating that the equality check within the `equals` function is failing.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `equals` function to check for the same number of blocks before comparing their contents.
   - Improve the `canonicalize` function to properly identify unique properties of each block for sorting.
   - Modify the block comparison to ensure an accurate check for equality based on block properties.

5. Corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
      
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring(), block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the function, the `equals` method should now properly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and block contents, passing the failing test.
