### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check the equality between two instances of `BlockManager`, based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` fails, suggesting that the equality check implemented in the `equals` function is incorrect.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function may not be correctly handling the comparison of axes and blocks.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function may not be behaving as expected.
3. The implementation of `block.equals` may have issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the equality comparison within the `equals` function. The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the equality check is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to a failed test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the axes of both `BlockManager` instances are correctly compared.
2. Verify that the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function is correct.
3. Confirm that the `block.equals` function is implemented properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version ensures proper comparison of axes, sorting of blocks, and individual block equality check. This should fix the bug and make the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
