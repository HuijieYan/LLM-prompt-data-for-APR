1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two data structures (`self` and `other`) for equality. It first compares the axes of both structures, then consolidates them in place, and finally checks if the blocks within those structures are equal. The function may contain a bug in the logic of comparing blocks.

2. The error seems to be occurring during the block comparison step. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function before comparing them. The issue might be related to how blocks are sorted or compared for equality.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks after sorting them using the canonicalization method. This results in the test case failing, with the assertion that `df1.equals(df2) is False` returning `True is False`.

4. To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function is correct and properly accounts for the data stored in each block.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Other methods remain the same
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare the number of blocks first
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        # Compare each block individually
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False

        return True
```

This corrected version ensures that after sorting the blocks, each block from `self_blocks` is compared with the corresponding block from `other_blocks` in a loop, returning `False` if any pair of blocks is not equal. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
