### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the comparison is not returning the expected result.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns in different orders and expects the `equals` method to return `False`, but it fails with an `AssertionError`.
4. The bug might be in the way the blocks are being sorted and compared. By comparing the blocks' content and their order, we can find the issue causing the incorrect equality comparison.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly for equality. The comparison logic should account for both block content and order.
2. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data along with its type for more accurate comparison.
3. After sorting the blocks based on the new sorting criteria, we can iterate over the blocks and compare each pair for equality.
4. By modifying the comparison logic as described, the bug should be fixed.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function equals in the BlockManager class

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order with data, dtype.name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__repr__(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of `DataFrame` objects with columns in different orders should now return `False` as expected, fixing the bug.
