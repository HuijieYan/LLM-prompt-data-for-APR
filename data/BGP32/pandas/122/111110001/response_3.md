### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, which is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within them for equality.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion in the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing, suggesting that the `equals` method is not correctly determining the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. The issue seems to be with how the `equals` method compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by potentially comparing the block data values instead of just their attributes.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `equals` method to correctly compare the data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, rather than just comparing attributes such as `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare block data values instead of attributes
        return all(
            block.get_values().equals(oblock.get_values()) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version compares the actual data values in the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring a more accurate equality comparison.
