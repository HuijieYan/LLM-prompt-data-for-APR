### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` overrides the existing `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It checks if the number of axes is the same, then iterates over each axis to check their equality, consolidates the blocks in place for both `BlockManager` objects, and finally compares the blocks of each object in a sorted order.
3. The failing test is testing the equality of two `DataFrame` objects using the `equals` function from the `BlockManager` class. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, indicating that the two `DataFrame` objects are considered equal by the buggy `equals` function.
4. The bug occurs in the comparison of the blocks. The sorting and comparison logic for the blocks is incorrect, leading to a false positive for equality.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for comparing the blocks of `BlockManager` objects. The correct order of operations should involve comparing blocks based on their type and location.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fix the bug in the equals method of BlockManager
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks in place before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

### With this corrected version, the function now correctly compares the blocks by comparing their shapes and values directly, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
