### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and block data. If any of these components are not equal, the function returns `False`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is creating two different DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns `a` and `b` having different data types in each DataFrame. It then checks if `df1` equals `df2`, which should return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True is False`. This indicates that the comparison inside the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison inside the `equals` function not correctly handling DataFrames with different column data types. Due to the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, the sorting of blocks based on data type name and manager locations may lead to inconsistent ordering for DataFrames with columns of different types.

### Fix Strategy:
Revising the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data content instead of just the data type name should address the bug. This change will prioritize the content of the blocks over their types for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # now sort the blocks by content rather than just by data type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.to_hashable().values.tostring()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to generate a hash based on the block's values, we ensure that blocks are compared based on their content instead of just their type. This modification should fix the bug and make the comparison more robust to handle DataFrames with different column data types correctly.
