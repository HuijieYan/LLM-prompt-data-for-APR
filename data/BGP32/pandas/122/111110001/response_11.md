### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two data structures represented by `self` and `other` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames in the failing test is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `equals` method is implemented in the `BlockManager` class.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves verifying the logic for comparing the axes and blocks, and potentially improving the block comparison logic to ensure accurate equality checks.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._ref_locs, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
After making the change above, re-run the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to verify that the corrected version of the `equals` method now correctly identifies the inequality between the two DataFrames.
