### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is checking equality between two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, sorts and compares the blocks in both instances.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that it expected `False` but got `True`.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function, where the ordering of the blocks may be causing the issue.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(np.dtype(block.dtype).name), tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().ravel()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

I have modified the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the block's dtype name to `str` and apply the proper conversion to `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared in the correct order.
