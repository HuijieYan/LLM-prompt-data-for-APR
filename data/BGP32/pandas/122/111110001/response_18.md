### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two sets of blocks from different instances.
2. The function is comparing the axes of the two instances, then consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks within the instances.
3. The error occurs when comparing the blocks because the sorting of the blocks is being done using a `canonicalize` function which should return a tuple but mistakenly calls `as_array` on `mgr_locs`.
4. The `as_array` call on `mgr_locs` should be fixed, and the sorting should be adjusted to properly compare the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly return a tuple by using `mgr_locs` directly without calling `as_array`.
2. Ensure that the `blocks` are being compared correctly between the two instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple properly and sorting the blocks based on that tuple, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
