### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by their axes and blocks. It sorts and compares the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.
2. The error occurs in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` where it creates two DataFrames with different values for the columns "a" and "b" and expects them to not be equal.
3. The error message shows that the actual assertion is failing because it evaluates to `True is False`, indicating that the DataFrames are considered equal even though they have different values.
4. The issue is likely in the comparison logic of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. It might be incorrectly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.
5. To fix the bug, we need to compare the values of the blocks within the DataFrames instead of the ordering and type of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class to compare the values of blocks rather than the sorting based on type and manager locations.
- Use the values of each block to check for equality between the two instances of `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.get_numeric_data()
    other_blocks = other.get_numeric_data()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual block values within the DataFrames, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
