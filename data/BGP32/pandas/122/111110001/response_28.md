### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison involves checking if the axes of the two objects are equal, consolidating them in place, sorting the blocks in a canonical order, and then comparing each block for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, which suggests that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, as well as the consolidation process and sorting logic. The comparison logic may be faulty, leading to incorrect equality checks.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that we compare the blocks correctly and handle the consolidation and sorting processes accurately to guarantee the correctness of the equality comparison.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves verifying the comparison logic within the `equals` function, ensuring proper handling of block consolidation and sorting, and making necessary adjustments to correctly identify when two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.dtype, block._ftype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating a more detailed comparison of the block attributes like `items`, `dtype`, `_ftype`, and `mgr_locs`, and verifying the equality of the block `values`, we can ensure a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` objects in the corrected `equals` function. This will address the bug and make the function return the correct result for equality comparison.
