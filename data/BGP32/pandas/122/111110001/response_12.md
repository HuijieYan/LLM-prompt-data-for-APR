## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their axes, blocks, and values.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, but due to a sorting issue in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison fails and the function returns an incorrect result.
3. The bug causes the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing them in the `equals` method.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should compare the blocks correctly and pass the failing test case.
