### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The function fails because it compares the two DataFrames by blocks and their order, leading to a false positive when checking for equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks independently without relying on their order, ensuring that the values within the blocks are equal.
5. The corrected version of the function will compare the blocks individually without enforcing a specific order.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.items: block.make_block_same_class(oblock)
                   for oblock, block in zip(other.get_blocks(), self.get_blocks())}
    other_blocks = {oblock.items: oblock
                    for oblock in other.get_blocks()}

    for label, block in self_blocks.items():
        if label not in other_blocks or not block.equals(other_blocks[label]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version first organizes the blocks in dictionaries based on their items (label). Then, it individually compares the blocks from self and other, ensuring that each block exists in the corresponding dictionary and has equal values.
