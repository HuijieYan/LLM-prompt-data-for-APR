The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to compare dataframes using the `equals` method, which results in a mismatch due to different data types in the columns. The function is sorting the blocks based on data type and location, which does not solve the problem.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to return a hash of the block content, which will allow for a more accurate comparison. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by comparing the actual content of the blocks rather than their data type and location. Now the function should be able to accurately determine whether two dataframes are equal based on their content.
