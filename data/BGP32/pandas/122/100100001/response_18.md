## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames by checking multiple properties like axes, blocks, and elements within the blocks.
- The bug might be related to sorting the blocks using a custom sorting function `canonicalize`, which might not be correctly handling the comparison.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns "a" and "b" having different values in different order. The test asserts that these two DataFrames are not equal based on the data.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from the custom sorting function `canonicalize` used to sort the blocks. The sorting is done based on the combination of data type name and manager locations, which may not be an appropriate way to canonicalize blocks for comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to review the approach of canonicalizing blocks for comparison. Instead of using a custom sorting function, we can directly compare blocks based on their contents without custom sorting.
- We should ensure that the comparison logic correctly handles the comparison of DataFrame blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing blocks without custom sorting, we can ensure a correct comparison for the DataFrames. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
