The issue in the `equals` function arises from the fact that it is comparing two dataframes based on their columns' data types and values at corresponding positions. However, the bug lies in the logic of sorting the blocks within the dataframes. The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, where it should be comparing the contents of the blocks themselves rather than just their types and locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual content of the blocks. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual content of the blocks using `block.values.equals(oblock.values)`, we ensure that the dataframes are compared based on their data values rather than just their types and locations. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly with the given test.
