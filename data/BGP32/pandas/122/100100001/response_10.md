## Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in how the function compares the DataFrames in terms of their blocks. The function sorts the blocks of each DataFrame using a `canonicalize` function that combines the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. However, in the failing test case, the blocks are not always in the same order for the two DataFrames, causing the comparison to fail even though the actual data may be equal.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the ordering of the columns within the blocks. This way, the comparison between DataFrames will take into account the actual data in blocks, rather than just their types and locations.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, column order, and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            tuple(block.columns.tolist()),
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction to the `equals` function, the function should now be able to correctly compare the DataFrames in the failing test case and pass the test successfully.
