This buggy function is part of the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. The `equals` method is used to compare two internal data structures within the pandas library. The function first checks if the axes of the two structures are equal in length. If not, it returns False. Next, it checks if all axes are equal using the `equals` method, consolidates both structures in place, and checks if the number of blocks in each structure is the same. The function then sorts and compares the blocks in the two structures.

The bug in this function is related to comparing the blocks in the two structures. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing the blocks in the two data frames.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the shape of the blocks in addition to the data type and manager locations. By considering the shape of the blocks, the function can distinguish between different blocks that have the same data type and manager locations. This modification ensures that the comparison between blocks is accurate and reliable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the shape of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with the same data type and manager locations but different shapes are correctly compared. This modification should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test provided.
