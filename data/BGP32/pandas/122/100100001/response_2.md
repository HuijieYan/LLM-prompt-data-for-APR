## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function is due to the fact that it is comparing the dataframes based on the column order and data types. However, the bug is the incorrect comparison when dataframes have columns of the same data types but in a different order.

To fix this bug and make the `equals` function work correctly, we need to compare the DataFrames based on their actual data values instead of just column order and data types.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    
    self_values = self.values
    other_values = other.values
    return (self_values == other_values).all()
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now compares the DataFrames based on their index, columns, and values, ensuring an accurate comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
