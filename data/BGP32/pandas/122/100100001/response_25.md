## Analysis:
This buggy function is a method `equals` of a class, which compares two objects of the same class for equality. The function checks if the number of axes (dimensions) and the number of blocks are the same between the two objects. Then it attempts to compare each block in the two objects for equality by canonicalizing the blocks based on their data type and locations.

## Identified Issue:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the comparison of blocks. It is trying to compare blocks in a DataFrame but taking into account only the data type and locations of the blocks while ignoring the actual data within each block.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare blocks by their data type and locations does not consider the actual data within each block. The `equals` method is returning incorrect results as it compares the blocks based on these canonicalized values, leading to false negatives in cases where the blocks may have different data but similar data type and locations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's actual data when sorting and comparing the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the complete data within each block for equality.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and data to compare blocks accurately
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By including the block's data in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the block comparison considers all aspects of the block for equality. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
