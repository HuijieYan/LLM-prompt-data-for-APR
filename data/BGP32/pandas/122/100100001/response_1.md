The bug in the provided function lies in the way it compares the DataFrames `self` and `other` for equality. The bug occurs due to using the `block.equals()` method to compare blocks of data within the two DataFrames. The issue is that the bug fails to correctly handle the case where the order of columns is different between the two DataFrames.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to sort the columns of both `self` and `other` DataFrames before comparing the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the order of columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    sorted_self_cols = sorted(self.columns)
    sorted_other_cols = sorted(other.columns)
    if sorted_self_cols != sorted_other_cols:
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare two DataFrames for equality regardless of the order of columns. The provided failing test should now pass with this corrected version.
