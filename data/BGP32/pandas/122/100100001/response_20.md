The bug in the provided equals function is that it is not correctly comparing the values of the DataFrames. It currently uses the equals method for comparing the axes, but it should be comparing the actual values of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the equals function to compare the values of the blocks instead of just comparing the axes. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_result_as_array()
    other_blocks = other.get_result_as_array()

    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

In this corrected version, we are now comparing the actual values of the blocks using the `np.array_equal` function, which properly checks for equality of all values in the blocks.

After making this change, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass as intended.

(NOTE: You may need to import the necessary libraries and make any required adjustments based on the actual implementation of the DataFrame class.)
