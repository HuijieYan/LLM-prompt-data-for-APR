The bug in the provided `equals` function is related to how it compares DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function does not take into account the actual values in the DataFrames, but rather compares their internal structures and blocks based on data type and memory locations.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `equals` method to compare the values of the DataFrames rather than their internal structures. We can achieve this by directly comparing the values of the DataFrames using the `equals()` method provided by pandas.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    return self.equals(other)
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now correctly compare the values of the DataFrames and return `True` if they have the same values, and `False` otherwise. This updated function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided earlier.
