The bug in the `equals` function is due to comparing data directly without considering the column types. The function fails when comparing two DataFrames with different column types in a different order.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to first check if the column names are the same between the two DataFrames, and then ensure that the data in each column has the same type before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if list(self.columns) != list(other.columns):
        return False
    
    for col_name in self.columns:
        if not self[col_name].dtype == other[col_name].dtype:
            return False

        if not self[col_name].equals(other[col_name]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With these changes, the function will compare column names first, then check if the data types match, and finally compare the actual data in each column. This correction addresses the bug observed in the failing test function and ensures that the `equals` method behaves as expected for DataFrames with different column types.
