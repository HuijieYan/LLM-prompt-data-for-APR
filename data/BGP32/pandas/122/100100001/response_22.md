### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two DataFrames to check if they are equal. However, the bug might be causing it to return incorrect results for certain cases, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function seems to be trying to compare the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames. The bug might be in the logic used to compare these components.
2. There might be an issue with the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks for comparison.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` function may be causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for DataFrames that are actually not equal. This issue can be seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with different values are erroneously marked as equal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic used to compare the axes and blocks of the DataFrames.
2. Check the `canonicalize` function and its sorting mechanism to ensure that it correctly orders the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After fixing the `equals` function as shown above, it should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
