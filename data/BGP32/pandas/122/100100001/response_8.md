## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The bug is due to the comparison of the dataframes without considering the type of data in each column. The function is comparing the columns based on their order instead of their content.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the columns based on their content rather than the order. One way to do this is by sorting the dataframes based on the column values before the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare dataframes based on sorted values
    self_sorted = self.copy()
    self_sorted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
    self_sorted = self_sorted.sort_values(by=list(self_sorted.columns))

    other_sorted = other.copy()
    other_sorted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
    other_sorted = other_sorted.sort_values(by=list(other_sorted.columns))

    return self_sorted.equals(other_sorted)

```

With this correction, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as the dataframes are correctly compared based on the content of the columns rather than their order.
