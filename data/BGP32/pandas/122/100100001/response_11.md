## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two objects and return `True` if they are equal, else `False`. The function first checks if the number of axes in each object is the same, then it compares each axis, consolidates the objects, and finally compares the blocks of data.

## Issues:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle the case where the data types of the columns are different between `self` and `other`, leading to incorrect comparison results.

## Bug Cause:
In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` have similar columns but with different data types. The buggy `equals` function does not consider the data types during comparison, leading to a false positive result.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data types of the blocks. Additionally, we should update the `equals` function to check the data types along with the block values during comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering type and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the data types of blocks during comparison and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
