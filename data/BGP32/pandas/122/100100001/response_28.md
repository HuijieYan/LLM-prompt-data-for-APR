The issue with the `equals` function lies in how it compares the DataFrame blocks. The function is comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, but the order of columns in the DataFrames is not being considered. This leads to false positives when comparing DataFrames that have the same data but different column orders.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the column names when sorting the blocks. This way, the function will correctly compare DataFrames even if the columns are in a different order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs and column names
    # to distinguish blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.columns.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly compare DataFrames taking into account both the block content and the column order. The provided failing test case should pass with this corrected version of the function.
