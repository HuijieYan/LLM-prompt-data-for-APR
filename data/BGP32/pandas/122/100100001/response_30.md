The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two internal block managers and check if they are equal. However, there is a bug in the function where it is not handling the comparison of blocks within the managers correctly. The bug is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly for cases where the blocks within the managers are not in the same order or have different data types.

The bug occurs due to the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks. The `block.dtype.name` should not be used alone to compare the blocks as it only gives the data type of the block, but does not consider the actual data stored in the block. This leads to incorrect comparisons and hence the function fails when comparing two dataframes with different data types in the columns.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take into account both the data type and the actual data stored in the block. One way to achieve this is to concatenate the data within the block with the data type name for comparison. This ensures that the comparison considers both the data type and the values within the block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block values along with the data type name in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison will now consider both the data type and the actual values within the blocks. This correction ensures that the `equals` function will correctly compare two internal block managers and return the expected result.
