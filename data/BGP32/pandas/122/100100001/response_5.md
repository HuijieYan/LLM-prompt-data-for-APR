## Analysis:
The `equals` function is intended to compare two pandas objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames are created with different values in each column. The expected outcome is `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal.

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation lies in the comparison of DataFrames. The function is comparing the blocks without considering the values within those blocks. So, even if the block order is different, the function may incorrectly return `True` if the blocks themselves are the same shape.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrames. By iterating over all the blocks and comparing their contents, we can ensure a proper equality check.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Check equality block by block
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

After making these changes to the `equals` function, it should now correctly compare the contents of each block within the DataFrames, resulting in the expected behavior for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
