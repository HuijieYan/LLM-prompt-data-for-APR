## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two data structures for equality, specifically focusing on the axes and blocks of the data.
- The bug is likely related to how the blocks are being sorted and compared.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with mismatched data in columns 'a' and 'b', expecting them to be unequal.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug likely occurs due to how the blocks of the DataFrames are being compared for equality. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function might not produce the desired result for detecting inequality.

## Strategy for Fixing:
- Instead of solely relying on sorting the blocks, consider comparing the values directly within each block to determine equality.
- Avoid sorting the blocks based on potentially non-unique identifiers.
- Compare the structure and values of corresponding blocks between the two DataFrames.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    return all(
        compare_blocks(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i])
        for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

By directly comparing each block for equality in the corrected version, the function can accurately determine whether the two DataFrames are equal. This approach avoids potential issues with sorting blocks based on identifiers that may not fully capture the differences between the DataFrames.
