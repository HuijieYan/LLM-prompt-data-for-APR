## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes based on their axes, blocks, and block contents. It sorts and compares each block within the dataframes to determine equality. The bug might be occurring in the comparison of blocks due to a sorting issue or incorrect ordering.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the dataframes are different. This results in failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` as it expects the comparison between two dataframes to return `False`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks and the comparison of block contents are correct. The issue might be related to how the blocks are being sorted or how the `equals` method is implemented for the blocks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the corrected version of the function should now correctly compare the dataframes and pass the failing test.
