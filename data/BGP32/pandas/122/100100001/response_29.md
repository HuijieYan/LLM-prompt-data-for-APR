The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two data structures to check if they are equal. The function first checks if the lengths of both structures are equal, then iterates over the axes and blocks to compare each component.

The bug arises when comparing the two data frames in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The bug causes the function to erroneously return `True`, indicating that the two data frames are equal when they are not.

The bug occurs because the function does not compare the values within the blocks correctly due to the sorting approach used. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations to ensure consistency, but this may lead to incorrect comparisons within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the values within the blocks, in addition to their type name and manager locations. This will ensure that the comparisons are done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, incorporating values for precise comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now takes into account the values of the blocks while sorting them, ensuring that a precise comparison is made between the two data structures. The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
