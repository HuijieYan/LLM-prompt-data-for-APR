### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals()` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This function is used to check for equality between two objects. The function assumes that the blocks within the objects have been consolidated and then compares them. However, if the blocks have not been consolidated, the comparison can fail.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `_consolidate_inplace()` method is called on both `self` and `other`, assuming it will consolidate the blocks. If the blocks are unconsolidated, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` could be problematic if there are unconsolidated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function assumes that both `self` and `other` have already consolidated blocks before comparison. In the failing test, the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have blocks that are not consolidated, leading to a false negative result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparison. One approach could be to consolidate the blocks within the function itself before performing the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consolidating the blocks at the beginning of the `equals()` function, we ensure that both `self` and `other` have their blocks in a consistent state before comparison. This correction should make the function more robust and pass the failing test.
