The bug in the provided function `equals` is that it does not correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with different data types. The function is sorting the blocks based on the combination of data type name and manager locations, which might not accurately represent the actual equality of the DataFrames.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to handle data type comparison and manager locations separately. Additionally, we can add a check to compare the data types of the blocks before proceeding with equality comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block data type and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # check if the blocks have the same data type before comparing
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if str(block1.dtype) != str(block2.dtype):
            return False
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test should now pass as it correctly handles the comparison of DataFrame blocks with different data types.
