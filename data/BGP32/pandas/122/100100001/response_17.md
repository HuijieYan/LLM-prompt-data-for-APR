## Analysis:
The `equals` function is comparing two instances of a class to check if their attributes match. The function compares the axes and blocks of two instances, and then uses a `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks.

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that the `canonicalize` function is not able to handle the difference in data types between the two input dataframes. This results in the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison returning `True`, even though the dataframes have different values.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the different data types. One way to do this is to first compare the column names between the two dataframes and then compare the values in each column.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(df):
        return (df.columns.tolist(), df.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `df1.equals(df2)` function call in the failing test should return `False` as expected.
