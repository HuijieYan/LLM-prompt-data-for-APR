## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two objects of the same class for equality.
2. It compares the axes of the two objects and then consolidates them in place.
3. It then checks the length of blocks and sorts them based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
4. Finally, it compares each block in sorted order for equality.

## Identified Bug:
In the `canonicalize` function, while sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, `block.dtype.name` should be compared with `oblock.dtype.name` instead of `block.equals(oblock)`.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change `block.equals(oblock)` to `block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name`.

## Corrected Version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
