### Analysis
The `equals` function is checking if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The function compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them in place and compares the blocks present in both objects.

The failing test is comparing two DataFrames with swapped columns, expecting them to be unequal. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, suggesting that the function incorrectly returned `True` instead of `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the function correctly compares the axes and then proceeds to compare the blocks. However, the issue might lie in how the blocks are compared or how they are sorted before comparison.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely arises from how the function compares and sorts the blocks in the `BlockManager`. It seems that the sorting based on `canonicalize` function is not correctly distinguishing the blocks, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. We can update the `canonicalize` function to include more information for a better distinction between blocks. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate to reflect the intended logic.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects based on both values and data types, ensuring a more accurate determination of equality.
