### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the order of columns between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` being compared. The issue stems from how the function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function generates a sorting order based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of the block. However, in the failing test, the columns are in different order between `df1` and `df2`, resulting in the blocks being sorted incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to consider the column labels of the data frames during sorting to ensure that blocks are aligned correctly even if columns are in different orders. This can be achieved by sorting blocks based on the column labels rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column labels
    def canonicalize(block):
        return [label for label in block.items.tolist()]

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this corrected version of the `equals` function, the function should properly handle DataFrame comparisons with different column orders and pass the failing test case.
