### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager`. The function is trying to compare blocks between `self` and `other` by sorting them based on their type name and positions in memory, specifically using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have columns `a` and `b`, but they are swapped in the two dataframes. This leads to the comparison failing because the blocks are sorted incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to refactor the block comparison mechanism. We should ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their positions in memory. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data in the blocks during sorting.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison within blocks will be based on their actual values, leading to correct dataframe comparison behavior.
