### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the misalignment in comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the function. The function sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs`. The comparison between the sorted blocks is done using the `equals` method, which fails to correctly handle the data types in this case. This results in the function returning an incorrect value, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic used in the `equals` function. We should ensure that the comparison between the sorted blocks properly handles the different data types involved. 

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a change in the `canonicalize` function to convert the data type to a string representation for comparison. This ensures proper handling of different data types when comparing blocks.
