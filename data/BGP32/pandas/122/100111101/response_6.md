The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The error message shows that the comparison `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the provided data frames `df1` and `df2`.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. The function first compares the axes of two data frames (`self` and `other`) and then compares the blocks. However, the comparison logic inside the function is incorrect, resulting in a wrong return value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is correctly performed for both axes and blocks. One possible strategy to fix the bug is:
1. Update the conditional statements that check the axes' length and equality to include both axes of the data frames.
2. Update the comparison logic for the blocks of the data frames.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
