### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the function is comparing the content of the DataFrame blocks. In the provided buggy function, the blocks are sorted based on the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` of the block. This sorting operation can lead to incorrect comparisons between blocks with different data types or indexes, resulting in false positives in the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are sorted and compared. Instead of sorting based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, we should focus on comparing the blocks directly based on their content.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

### Expected Outcome:
The corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks in the DataFrame without sorting them based on potentially misleading criteria. This correction ensures that the DataFrame equality check behaves as intended and passes the failing test case provided.
