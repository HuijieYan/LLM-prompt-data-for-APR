### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison logic between two DataFrames (`self` and `other`). The function first checks if the number of axes in the two DataFrames is the same. If not, it returns `False`, which is correct behavior. Then, it proceeds to compare each axis using list comprehension with zip, which seems correct.

However, the bug occurs later when comparing the blocks within the DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type name and manager locations. The bug arises because the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have similar blocks but with data of differing types. This causes the comparison to fail incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks. Since the issue stems from incorrectly handling data types in the block comparison, we should adjust the comparison method to consider both the data type and the actual values within the blocks.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if not block1.dtype == block2.dtype:
            return False
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare blocks by both data type and values within the blocks, which should fix the failing test case provided.
