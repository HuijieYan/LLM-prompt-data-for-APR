### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, in the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` are being compared using the `equals` method, which internally uses the `equals` function of `BlockManager`.

The issue arises from the fact that the `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) are not correctly handling the comparison of `DataFrame` objects. The mismatch in the dtype and values of the columns between `df1` and `df2` causes the comparison to fail, resulting in a misleading assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the comparison of `DataFrame` objects in the `BlockManager`'s `equals` function more effectively. Since the columns in `df1` and `df2` do not align, we need to compare the values of the columns correctly.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate()
    other._consolidate()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By handling the comparison of `DataFrame` objects correctly within the `equals` function of `BlockManager`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and provide the expected output.
