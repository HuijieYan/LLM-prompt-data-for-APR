### Bug Explanation:

The bug is due to the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. In the failing test case provided, the data types of the columns do not match between `df1` and `df2`. However, the function wrongly use a sorting mechanism assuming the order is not important for equality comparison. This leads to a false positive result, indicating that the data frames are equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function sorting mechanism since it is causing incorrect results. We should directly compare the blocks without altering the order. This way, we can accurately check the equality of the blocks between the two data frames based on their actual content.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the sorting of blocks and directly comparing them in their original order, the function will provide the correct result for equality comparison of the data frames.
