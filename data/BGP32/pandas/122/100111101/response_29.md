### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of data frames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The test expects the two data frames to be considered not equal because the values of the columns `a` and `b` are swapped between `df1` and `df2`.

In the buggy function, the comparison is based on checking if the axes and blocks of the data frames are equal. The bug occurs because the function does not consider the underlying data values within the blocks when comparing the data frames.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the values within the blocks of the data frames, rather than just comparing the structure. This involves checking the values of the elements within each block to determine equality. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.flatten()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.flatten()
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for data1, data2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not data1.equals(data2):
            return False

    return True
```

### Conclusion

The corrected version of the `equals` function now iterates through the data within each block of the input data frames to ensure that all values are compared for equality. This modification addresses the bug identified in the failing test case and should now pass the test successfully.
