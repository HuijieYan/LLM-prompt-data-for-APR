### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` when the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal. The issue seems to be related to how the function is comparing the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks. The function does not consider the block type when generating the key for sorting, leading to incorrect comparisons of blocks with different data types.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data type in the sorting key. This will ensure that blocks with different data types are not considered equal during the comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block data type alongside the block dtype name, we ensure that blocks with different data types are correctly distinguished during the sorting process. This modification should address the bug and make the function compare `BlockManager` objects accurately.
