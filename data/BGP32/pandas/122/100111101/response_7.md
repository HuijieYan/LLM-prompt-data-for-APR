The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of DataFrames with different data types in columns. The function assumes that columns are in the same order and have the same data types, leading to incorrect equality comparisons. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare columns based on names and data types rather than relying on their positions.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(
        self.columns.equals(other.columns)  # Compare columns names first
        and self.dtypes.equals(
            other.dtypes
        )  # Compare data types of columns next
        for self, other in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing column names and data types in the corrected version, we ensure a more accurate comparison between DataFrames. This change should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing test case.
