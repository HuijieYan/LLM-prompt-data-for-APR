### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the comparison is made between the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, and then compare the sorted blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect comparison results even when the `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns `"a"` and `"b"`, but in different order, and asserts that they are not equal. The buggy `equals` function incorrectly determines the equality based on sorting the blocks, leading to a wrong comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should directly compare the blocks in the same order they are stored in the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the same order they are stored within the `BlockManager`, we ensure that the equality check is based on the actual content of the blocks, rather than on their attributes. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
