The bug in the `equals` function is related to comparing DataFrame objects with different data values. The function currently sorts the blocks by datatype and location, assuming that this canonicalization step will ensure equality between the DataFrames. However, the equality comparison should be based on the actual values within the blocks, not just their types and positions.

### Cause of the bug:
When the existing buggy `equals` function is called with `df1.equals(df2)` where `df1` and `df2` have different data values but the same column names, the function incorrectly returns `True` due to how the blocks are sorted and compared based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values within the blocks of the DataFrames instead of just their types and positions. We should iterate over the data within the blocks and compare each element for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison will correctly iterate over the data within the blocks and compare them element by element, ensuring accurate DataFrame equality checks.
