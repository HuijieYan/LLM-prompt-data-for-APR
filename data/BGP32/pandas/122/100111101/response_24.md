### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of values within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks based on data type and location.

When sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the `canonicalize` function only considers the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as key values for sorting. However, in the failing test case, the data values of the blocks are different, leading to a false positive comparison. This causes the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion to incorrectly return `True` when it should be `False`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to take into account the actual values within the blocks for a more accurate comparison. By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the actual data values in addition to the data type and location, we can ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their complete content rather than just the dtype and location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values.view(),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.values.view()` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared based on their content, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case.
