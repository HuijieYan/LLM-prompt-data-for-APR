### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` (data type name) and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` (manager locations converted to a list). However, this approach does not consider the order of columns within the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

In the failing test case provided, `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames with columns in a different order. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True`, indicating that the two DataFrames are equal when they are not due to the different column order.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the order of columns within blocks is properly considered during the comparison. Sorting the blocks solely based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not sufficient for accurate equality checks. Instead, we should consider the order of columns within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            [col for col in block.items],
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the column names represented by `block.items` in the `canonicalize` function and sorting the blocks based on these additional values, we ensure that the order of columns is considered during the comparison process. This correction should address the bug and make the `equals` function capable of correctly determining equality between `BlockManager` objects.
