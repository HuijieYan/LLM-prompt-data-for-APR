### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the data frames `df1` and `df2` based on their column names only, instead of comparing the values within those columns. The function sorts the blocks based on the column data types and manager locations, but it does not consider the actual values in the blocks when checking for equality. This leads to the function returning `True` when it should return `False`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of just sorting them based on data type and manager locations. We should iterate over each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and compare the values within those blocks to ensure that the data frames are equal in terms of both structure and content.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version will correctly compare the values within the blocks of the data frames `df1` and `df2` and return `False` as expected in the failing test.
