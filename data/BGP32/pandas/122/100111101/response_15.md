### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function currently sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them, which results in incorrect block ordering. This incorrect ordering causes the comparison to fail even when the actual content of the blocks is equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks rather than just the type name and manager locations. This way, the blocks will be sorted based on their content, ensuring a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.flatten().tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.flatten().tolist())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated version of the function, the blocks will be sorted based on their content, allowing for a correct comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
