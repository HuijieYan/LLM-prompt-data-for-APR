### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The function expects two BlockManager instances, compares their axes, and then compares their blocks. However, the comparison logic seems to be incorrect as identified by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two different DataFrames are erroneously considered equal causing the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function is comparing the blocks of the two managers without considering the order in which the blocks are arranged. This may result in incorrect comparisons.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'. The `equals` function should correctly identify that these two DataFrames are not equal based on their values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function compares the blocks in a way that considers the actual data values rather than just comparing the order of the blocks. We can achieve this by comparing the data itself within each block.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_block_and_oblock(block, oblock):
        blk_values = [block._try_coerce_and_cast_result(other_blocks.block_values)]
        oblk_values = [oblock._try_coerce_and_cast_result(other_blocks.block_values)]
        return blk_values == oblk_values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        compare_block_and_oblock(block, oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding a new function `compare_block_and_oblock` that compares the values of the blocks rather than comparing the block objects themselves, we can accurately determine if two BlockManager instances are equal. 

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and properly compare the data within the blocks to determine equality.
