The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to assert `True is False`, indicating that the `df1` DataFrame is incorrectly identified as equal to the `df2` DataFrame. This inconsistency arises from the comparison of the DataFrames' columns, which should be based on values rather than order.

The bug stems from how the function iterates over and compares the blocks. The function currently sorts the blocks based on their types and locations, rather than their values. This leads to incorrect comparisons when the column order in two DataFrames is different.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function compares the blocks. Instead of sorting blocks based on type and location, we should consider the actual values of the data within the blocks when performing the equality check.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on values rather than type and location
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        block1_values = block1.get_values()
        block2_values = block2.get_values()
        return np.array_equal(block1_values, block2_values)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual values, this corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal.
