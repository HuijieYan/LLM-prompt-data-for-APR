### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects in a DataFrame context. The bug causes the comparison to fail when the data types of the columns in the two DataFrames are not in the same order. This is evident in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where the columns "a" and "b" are in different order in `df1` and `df2`.

The bug arises because the function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations but does not consider the actual column order. As a result, when comparing two DataFrames with columns in different orders, the function incorrectly determines them as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for the column order in addition to the dtype and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, block placement, and column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.to_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the function, it now considers the column order as part of the comparison criteria, ensuring that DataFrames with columns in different orders are correctly identified as not equal. This should make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
