### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It first compares the axes of both objects, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks, and finally compares the blocks in a canonicalized order.
2. The failing test in the GitHub issue shows that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different values but same types and structures.
3. The issue occurs when comparing blocks that have identical values but are in different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the block locations and types for comparison. This sorting process may incorrectly classify blocks with identical values but different locations as equal, causing the faulty comparison result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly differentiate blocks based on their values rather than locations. This will ensure that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Correction:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values, block.dtype.name)
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly identify the differences between two DataFrames and return `False` for the case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
