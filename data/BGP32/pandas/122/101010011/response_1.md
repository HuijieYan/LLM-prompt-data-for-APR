### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects element-wise. It checks if the axes are the same, consolidates the frames, compares the number of blocks, and then proceeds to compare each block element-wise.
   
2. The failing test is trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values in the columns, expecting the comparison to return `False`.

3. The error message indicates that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is erroneously resulting in `True`, leading to an assertion error.

4. The bug may stem from not correctly handling the comparison between dataframes with different values in columns. It seems that the sorting logic based on block properties might be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of dataframes with different values in columns. When the function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, it might not accurately represent the actual content of the blocks. This sorting logic can lead to similar blocks being compared as unequal if their sorting order differs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than the sorting order. One strategy could involve modifying the comparison method for blocks, ensuring that the actual content of the blocks is compared without relying too heavily on the sorting order.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare each block element-wise
        for block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This version ensures that each block in `self` is compared with the corresponding block in `other` directly without relying on sorting. This approach should fix the bug and make the comparison function correctly evaluate dataframes for equality.
