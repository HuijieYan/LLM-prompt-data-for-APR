### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class has a bug that causes it to incorrectly return True even when the blocks are not equal. The error message points to a failing test where two DataFrames with different values are incorrectly marked as equal.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function and comparing the sorted blocks. The issue appears to be related to how blocks are sorted and compared for equality.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, the comparison considers both the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of the block. This sorting may not always correctly distinguish between blocks that are actually different but have the same `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This can lead to incorrect equality comparisons when blocks are sorted based on these criteria.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more robust and reliable method to distinguish between blocks. We can consider using a combination of additional block properties or a more detailed comparison approach to ensure that blocks with different values are correctly sorted and compared for equality.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

In this corrected version, we modified the `canonicalize` function to use `block.values.tobytes()` instead of `block.dtype.name` to compare block values and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()` to compare block locations. This change ensures that blocks with different values or locations are correctly distinguished during sorting and comparison, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.
