### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two DataFrames for equality. The issue lies in the comparison logic when the DataFrame contains identical blocks with different locations.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is resulting in `assert True is False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function, which can lead to incorrect ordering of blocks for comparison.
5. To fix the bug, a strategy is to update the `canonicalize` function to use a better way to track block uniqueness.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Applying hash function to uniquely identify block contents
        return hash(tuple(block.values.reshape(-1)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to hash the block values, we can uniquely identify blocks irrespective of the location. This correction will address the issue of identical blocks with different locations leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
