### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class.
- The issue arises when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations.
- The failing test case showcases this issue by creating two DataFrames with columns in different positions.
- The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Error Cause:
- The bug exists because the `equals` function does not properly handle cases where blocks exist in DataFrames at different locations.
- It compares blocks from DataFrames in a non-canonical order, leading to incorrect results.
- The comparison should be based on the block's type name and `mgr_locs`, which indicate the positions of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for proper sorting.
- By sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations will still be considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After applying the corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where blocks exist at different locations within DataFrames. This correction will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
