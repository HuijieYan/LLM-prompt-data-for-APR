### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is overriding the `equals` function, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion failed, returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue also confirms that `equals` is returning `True` when it should have returned `False` for DataFrame objects with different block locations.
5. The bug arises from the way blocks are sorted and compared leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when sorting the internal blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`), the sorting key function `canonicalize` is based on the block's type name and locations. If the locations are different, for objects having equivalent values, the equality test will incorrectly return `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the block for comparison instead of relying on the block's locations.
2. Sort blocks based on their content, not on their locations, to ensure correct comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content (using `block.values.tostring()`), the corrected function ensures that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks, not their locations. This change should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function return the correct result for DataFrame objects with equivalent values.
