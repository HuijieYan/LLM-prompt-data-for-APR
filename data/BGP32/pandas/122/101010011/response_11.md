### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the incorrect comparison and leading to the failing test. The issue arises because of the different block locations handling in the comparison of two DataFrames.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class does not consider the case where identical blocks can have different locations. When comparing two DataFrames, the function assumes sorted blocks based on `canonicalize` criteria without taking into account the block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that it considers both the `dtype.name` and the block locations (`mgr_locs`). This modification will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are still considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After modifying the `canonicalize` function to include `mgr_locs` for each block, the comparison step in the `equals` function should consider both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` when checking for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the corrected version of the function, the comparison will correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and pass the failing test.
