### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py` of the pandas library.
2. The function is comparing two BlockManager objects for equality by comparing their attributes. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic within the function.
3. The error message indicates that when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, the comparison incorrectly returns `True` when the expected result should be `False`.
4. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem - the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the error message.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the block sorting logic within the `equals` method. If two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, they should not be considered equal, but due to the sorting based on `canonicalize` function (particularly on `mgr_locs`), the comparison logic fails.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix this bug, we need to modify the block sorting logic within the `equals` method.
2. We can change the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on block's internal attributes excluding `mgr_locs`.
3. By considering only relevant attributes for sorting, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to exclude mgr_locs for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the suggested modification in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now work correctly and pass the failing test specified in the GitHub issue.
