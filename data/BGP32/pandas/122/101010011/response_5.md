### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the issue when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function tries to check if two DataFrames are equal by sorting their blocks and comparing them iteratively based on block type and locations.
   
2. The error message shows that the test case is failing with `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly for two unequal DataFrames.

3. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem where a similar test case failed due to the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method tries to compare blocks based on block type and locations without considering the actual data in those blocks. This leads to incorrect equality checks causing the method to return `True` even when the DataFrames have different values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual values in each block of the DataFrames rather than just comparing based on block type and locations. This way, the function will accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare actual data in each block for equality
    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        (self_block_data == other_block_data).all() 
        for self_block_data, other_block_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now compare the actual values in each block of the DataFrames for equality, ensuring accurate results when checking if two DataFrames are equal.
