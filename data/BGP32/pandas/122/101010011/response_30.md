## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas library.
2. The error message indicates that the DataFrame `df1` is incorrectly considered equal to DataFrame `df2`.
3. The bug is causing `df1.equals(df2)` to incorrectly return True when it should return False due to different data values in the DataFrames.
4. The bug source is in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This leads to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal.
5. To fix the bug, the sorting criteria needs to be adjusted to ensure consistency in the result of the comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to only use the block `dtype.name` for sorting.
2. Remove the reference to `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` since it causes the problem in comparing blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug related to identical blocks with different locations causing the incorrect equality comparison should be resolved.
