### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of DataFrame blocks that have different locations but are otherwise identical, leading to incorrect results.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing unexpectedly, indicating a bug in the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison to consider the block's data content, not just its locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data in addition to its locations for more precise comparison.
2. Make sure to sort the DataFrame blocks based on their content, ensuring a correct comparison.
3. After updating the sorting logic, the comparison of blocks should reflect the actual data content rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.to_numpy().tobytes(), block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's content and data type, the corrected function should now accurately compare DataFrame blocks based on their actual data content, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.
