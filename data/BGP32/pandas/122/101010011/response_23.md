### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager`s, checks the lengths of their axes and blocks, and then compares the blocks' content.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing at `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem as the `equals` method wrongly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
5. The issue is caused by the method not considering the possible issue of identical blocks being at different locations within the `BlockManager`.
6. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to canonicalize the block order properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `self_axes` when sorting the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic to ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and self_axes
    # to correctly identify identical blocks even in different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            self_axes[block.mgr_locs.index].values,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will consider the locations of identical blocks correctly and return the expected result, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
