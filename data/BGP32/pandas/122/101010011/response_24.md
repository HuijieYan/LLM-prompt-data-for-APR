### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two DataFrame objects for equality based on their blocks without considering the order or location of the blocks.
2. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when the expected outcome should be `False`.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that there is a bug in the `equals` method of DataFrame objects when identical blocks have different locations.

### Error Cause:
1. The bug is caused by comparing the blocks of two DataFrame objects without taking into account their order or locations.
2. When the order or locations of the blocks differ between the two DataFrame objects, the comparison incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider the order and locations of the blocks.
2. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks before comparing them to ensure that the order and locations are consistent between the two DataFrame objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should appropriately handle comparisons between DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations, ensuring that the result is correct.
