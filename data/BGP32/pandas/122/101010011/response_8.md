### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two Pandas objects to check if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and other properties.
2. The error message indicates that in a specific test case, the comparison between two DataFrames using the `equals()` method is returning True when it should be False.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize()` function used to sort and compare blocks is incomplete, leading to incorrect comparisons between the DataFrames.
4. To fix the bug, we need to complete the `canonicalize()` function to properly represent the attributes used for block comparison. Also, ensure that the comparison logic in the `equals()` function takes into account the sorted and canonicalized blocks for accurate equality checking.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define a proper canonicalize function for blocks comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._dtype, repr(block.mgr_locs))
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using the corrected `canonicalize()` function with a complete representation of block attributes, the bug should be fixed. This updated logic will sort and compare Pandas blocks accurately, resolving the issue with `DataFrame.equals()` method returning incorrect results.
