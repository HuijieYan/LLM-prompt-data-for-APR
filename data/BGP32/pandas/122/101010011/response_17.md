### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function. The issue arises when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True`. This bug causes the test case to fail, as the expected result is `False`.

The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks is based on their order, and not their content. When blocks are sorted based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, identical blocks in different locations may be treated as different. Hence, the comparison results in a wrong outcome.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison strategy for blocks in the `BlockManager.equals` function. Rather than relying on sorting blocks, we should compare them based on their content to ensure correctness in the comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares each block in the `self.blocks` list with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This approach ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their positions.

### Conclusion:
By fixing the comparison strategy in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as equal. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and resolves the failing test case.
