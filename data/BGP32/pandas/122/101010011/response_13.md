### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class tries to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing individual blocks. 
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, leading to unexpected results.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar scenario where `df3.equals(df4)` returns `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The bug seems to be caused by an incorrect comparison of blocks due to their order. This is likely because the blocks are not sorted consistently before comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks before comparing them in the `equals` function.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying the fix as shown above, the `equals` function will correctly sort the blocks before comparison, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
