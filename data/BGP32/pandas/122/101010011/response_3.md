### Analyze the buggy function and related information

The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The function is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The error message provided from a failing test indicates that the `equals` method is not functioning correctly and returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The related `equals` method defined in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two objects based on their attributes and blocks. The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames with the same elements but in a different order. The function fails to account for the difference in block locations between the two DataFrames, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides further details about the problem. The user expects the `equals` method to return `False` when comparing two DataFrames with the same elements but different block locations. The user provided a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

### Identifying potential error locations 

The cause of the bug lies in the logic within the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. This sorting does not account for the possibility of unconsolidated blocks with the same elements but different locations, resulting in incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function's sorting logic needs to be modified to consider unconsolidated blocks with the same elements but different locations. One approach could involve modifying the sorting key to include additional information that accounts for the various block locations.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order considering block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items()), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method includes the item names in the sorting key within the `canonicalize` function to account for different block locations when comparing the blocks. With this modification, the function should now correctly compare two objects for equality, including cases where block locations differ.
