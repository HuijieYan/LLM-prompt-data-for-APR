### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the GitHub Issue

1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.
2. The failing test provided on GitHub shows that when comparing two DataFrames with different values in the corresponding columns, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`, leading to an assertion error.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy in the behavior of the `equals` method, where it wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks are different with different locations.
4. The issue seems to stem from the way the blocks are compared and sorted based on their type name and manager locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when sorting and comparing blocks within the `equals` method based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison still mistakenly considers them equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method. Instead of solely relying on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the actual data within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the actual block values rather than just sorting based on their type and locations. It ensures that blocks with the same values but different physical locations are correctly identified as unequal.
