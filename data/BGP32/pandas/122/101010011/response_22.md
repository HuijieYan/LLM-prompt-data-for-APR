### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal.
2. The error message suggests that for the provided test case, the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks within the `equals` method not accounting for different block locations that can contain the same values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism to consider block locations when comparing blocks.
6. By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in addition to the block content type, we can ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as distinct.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block locations, the corrected function ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal, addressing the bug.
