### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their internal properties.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method returned `True` when it was expected to be `False`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks are done based on their sorted order, which may not reflect the actual equality when there are unconsolidated blocks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider unconsolidated blocks and directly compare the blocks without sorting.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
      
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # check for equality of each block directly
    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing each block directly instead of sorting them, we can ensure that the `equals` method correctly determines the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
