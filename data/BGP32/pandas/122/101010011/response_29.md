### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The reported issue on GitHub highlights that the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
4. The bug is caused by sorting and comparing the blocks based on specific criteria which do not handle the case of identical blocks in different locations.
5. To resolve the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to handle identical blocks in different locations correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function used for sorting to include block values along with dtype.name and mgr_locs.
2. Modify the sorting logic in the `equals` method to handle identical blocks correctly by considering their values along with other criteria.
3. Deduplicate and refactor the comparison logic to handle potential edge cases and improve efficiency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block values and adjusting the sorting criteria in the `equals` method, the corrected version should address the bug related to identical blocks with different locations.
