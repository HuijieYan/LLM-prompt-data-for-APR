### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes, number of blocks, and each block are equal.
- The error message is indicating that when checking equality between two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, causing the `equals` method to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not account for the case where two DataFrames have identical blocks but those blocks are in different locations.
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on the type name and location to canonicalize their order before comparison. However, the ordering is not enough to handle cases where identical blocks are in different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing:
- To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be revised to handle cases where identical blocks are present but in different locations.
- A more robust method to compare blocks should be implemented, ensuring that identical blocks are considered equal even if their locations differ.
- The comparison should take into account not only the order and type of blocks but also their content to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual content using `x.values.tobytes()` for sorting, the corrected version should handle cases where identical blocks are present but in different locations. This updated logic ensures that the `equals` method accurately determines the equality between two `BlockManager` objects, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
