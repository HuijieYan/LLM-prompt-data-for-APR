### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, suggesting that the `equals` method is not returning the expected result for distinct DataFrames.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which aligns with the failing test.
4. The bug appears to stem from comparing the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `equals` method of the blocks. Since the order of blocks can vary, the comparison should not be solely based on block order.
5. To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to account for the scenario where blocks have the same content but are in different locations within the DataFrames.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we will modify the comparison logic within the `equals` method to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their order. By comparing the blocks based on content equivalence, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly treated as equal, even if their locations differ.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content equivalence
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if isinstance(block1, Block):
            return block1.equals(block2)
        else:
            return block1 == block2

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, Block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return block

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals` method to compare blocks based on content equivalence and using a consistent method for canonicalization, the corrected version should address the bug and correctly compare DataFrames for equality.
