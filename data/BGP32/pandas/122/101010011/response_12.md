### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is the `equals` method.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The issue might arise in the way blocks are sorted in the `canonicalize` function, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.
2. The equality check of blocks in the `equals` function might be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Explanation of the bug 

The bug causes the `BlockManager.equals` method to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations. This happens due to how blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function. When sorting blocks, if unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical blocks) are present, they might be considered unequal based on iteration order rather than their actual content, leading to the incorrect equality comparison.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that blocks are sorted in a way that considers both the block type and content to provide a proper comparison.
2. Adjust the equality check within the `equals` method to correctly assess the equality of blocks even if they are in different locations.
3. Handle cases where unconsolidated blocks might be present and affect the equality comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version incorporates a more robust comparison strategy by considering both the block type and values contained in the blocks when sorting them. This modification ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their location within the `BlockManager` objects.
