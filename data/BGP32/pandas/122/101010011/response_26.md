### Identified Bug:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class overrides the `equals` method, which is causing the comparison between two DataFrames to return `True` incorrectly. The issue arises from the way the blocks within the DataFrames are compared using the `equals` method. The bug is surfacing when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations due to the method used for sorting and comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This sorting leads to blocks with identical data but different locations being treated as not equal, resulting in the incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to determine a method for comparing blocks that does not depend on their location but rather on their actual content. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the blocks directly without sorting based on type name and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals method in BlockManager class

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The blocks are sorted based on the actual values within each block instead of their type name and manager locations.
- The comparison is made using `np.array_equal` to ensure that the values in each block are compared accurately without any location dependencies.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test by correctly comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal.
