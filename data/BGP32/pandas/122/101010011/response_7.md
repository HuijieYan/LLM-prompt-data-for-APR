### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class, which compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning True instead of False, even though the DataFrames are not equal. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `equals()` incorrectly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks, but different locations.
4. The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. Due to the bug, the order of blocks is not being correctly accounted for during the comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers not only the content but also the actual order of blocks in the `BlockManager`.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Ensure that blocks are sorted by mgr_locs for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()
        )
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks using both the block values and the `mgr_locs` attribute to maintain the correct order during comparison.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now compare the `BlockManager` instances correctly, ensuring that the comparison considers both block content and their actual locations.
