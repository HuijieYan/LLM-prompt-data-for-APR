### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The issue is related to DataFrame comparison with different values but having the same order causing `equals` to wrongly return `True`.
3. The error message shows that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) wrongly returned `True`, where it was expected to return `False`.
4. The cause of the bug is the sorting of blocks in the DataFrames based on their dtype and manager locations, which leads to incorrect comparison results due to different values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare values directly instead of considering the order of blocks.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Extract the block values to compare directly
    self_data = np.vstack([block.values for block in self.blocks])
    other_data = np.vstack([block.values for block in other.blocks])

    return np.array_equal(self_data, other_data)
``` 

This fix modifies the `equals` function to directly compare the block values of the DataFrames rather than sorting them based on dtype and manager locations. This change ensures correct comparison results even when the values are different.
