### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the provided code is the `BlockManager.equals()` method.
2. The method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and then sorting and comparing the blocks based on data type and block locations.
3. The error message indicates that the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed incorrectly. The issue on GitHub also points out a similar problem.
4. The cause of the bug is likely in the comparison logic of the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when sorting and comparing the blocks, we consider the content of the blocks correctly to check for equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate both the content and block locations for accurate block comparison.
2. Use a combination of block data and location for sorting the blocks to prevent false positives in the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on actual content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to include the block values for comparison and sorting, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case.
