### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function where it tries to access the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. The runtime values indicate that `mgr_locs` is accessed as an attribute of the `block` object, but it seems to not be defined as an attribute of the `IntBlock` class. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `IntBlock` and other block classes have the `mgr_locs` attribute defined. If `mgr_locs` is necessary for the comparison, it should be added as an attribute to all block classes. 

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, getattr(block, 'mgr_locs', None))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will handle cases where the `mgr_locs` attribute is missing by using `getattr` to avoid the AttributeError.
