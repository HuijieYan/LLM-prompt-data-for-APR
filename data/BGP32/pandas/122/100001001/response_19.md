The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks from two different BlockManagers (self and other) based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue likely arises when comparing the blocks due to an inconsistency in their order.

To fix the bug, one potential strategy is to ensure that the blocks from self and other BlockManagers are sorted and compared accurately. This can be done by modifying the canonicalize function and the comparison logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by combining dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I changed the dtype name to a string for compatibility in the comparison. Sorting the blocks based on the modified canonicalize function should ensure consistent ordering and enable accurate comparison, resolving the bug.
