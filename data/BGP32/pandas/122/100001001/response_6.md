The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is currently returning a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. However, the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` part is causing the issue as `mgr_locs` is not a valid attribute of the `block` object.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to use a valid attribute of the `block` object. Let's assume we want to use the index of the block as the second element of the tuple. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and index of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, self.blocks.index(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use `self.blocks.index(block)` as the second element of the tuple, we can fix the bug and ensure the function works correctly.
