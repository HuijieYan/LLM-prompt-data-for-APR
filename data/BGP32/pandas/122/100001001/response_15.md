The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The variable `block.mgr_locs` is of type `BlockPlacement`, and it doesn't have an attribute called `as_array`. This leads to an AttributeError and causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to correctly extract the necessary information from the `block` variable. We can modify the function to use the `indexers` attribute of `block.mgr_locs` to create a tuple for canonicalization.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexers))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly compare the blocks and return the expected result.
