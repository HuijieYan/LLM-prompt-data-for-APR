The bug in the provided function arises from the way it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by their data type name and memory locations. However, the bug occurs because the memory locations are not being handled correctly.

The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly converting the `block.mgr_locs` into a list for comparison. The `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call should be `block.mgr_locs.plocs.tolist()` to convert the memory locations to a list for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.plocs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to `block.mgr_locs.plocs.tolist()`, the function should now properly compare the memory locations of the blocks and return the correct result based on block equality.
