### Bug Explanation
In the provided function, there seems to be a logical flaw in the `equals` function's implementation. The function is checking the equality of two BlockManagers by sorting and comparing their blocks. However, the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function is designed to create a tuple based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes. 

The mistake occurs when the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` is accessed. In the buggy implementation, it is assumed that `mgr_locs` is an attribute of the `block`, leading to the bug and causing incorrect behavior during block comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed correctly. If `mgr_locs` is an attribute of the given block, then the error lies within the provided runtime values that are inconsistent with the function's design. However, if `mgr_locs` is not directly associated with the block, it may need to be derived in another way for proper comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version simplifies the `canonicalize` function to only use the `dtype.name` for sorting the blocks, resolving the bug caused by incorrectly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute.
