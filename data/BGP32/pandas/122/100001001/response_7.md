### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the function `equals` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The bug is likely to be in the comparison logic related to blocks. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, then it checks if each individual axis is equal between the two `BlockManagers`. Finally, it compares blocks within each `BlockManager`.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes. The comparison logic may be incorrect, leading to the function returning an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be corrected. Since the blocks are already sorted based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the comparison should be done directly between the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It is essential to ensure that the comparison logic inside the `all` function is correctly comparing the blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is replaced with a lambda function directly in the sorting key. This change should ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before the comparison.
