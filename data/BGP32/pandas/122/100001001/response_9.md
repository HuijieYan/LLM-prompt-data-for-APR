### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function aims to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes incorrect comparisons due to the sorting mechanism applied to the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function sorts the blocks of self and other BlockManager objects based on a `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`.
2. The bug arises when sorting the blocks because the `mgr_locs` attribute is not the same for both BlockManager objects. This variation in sorting criteria causes the function to incorrectly determine the equality of the two BlockManager objects.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to ensure that the sorting criteria are consistent and reliable for comparison. We can sort the blocks based on a stable and consistent attribute such as the `dtype.name` only.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based only on `block.dtype.name`, we eliminate the inconsistency introduced by `mgr_locs` and ensure a correct comparison between the BlockManager objects.
