### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` which are sorted lists of blocks. The sorting key used in the `canonicalize` function is a tuple of the block's dtype name and the manager locations. When comparing the blocks, the `equals` method is called on each pair of blocks.

However, the bug occurs because the `block` variable inside the `canonicalize` function is not being properly accessed. The `canonicalize` function should use the `block` variable provided as an argument, but it is currently referencing the undeclared `block` variable in the buggy logic.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `block` variable is correctly passed to the `canonicalize` function. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to accept the `block` as an argument. Simultaneously, we need to ensure that this `block` variable is correctly utilized within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, I modified the `key` argument in the `sorted` function calls to pass the `canonicalize` function correctly and fixed the referencing issue by using a lambda function to pass the `block` variable. This will ensure the correct comparison of blocks during the equality check.
