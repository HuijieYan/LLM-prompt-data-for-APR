The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The issue arises when comparing the blocks using `equals` method after sorting.

The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The bug might occur if the sorting is not consistent or if the `as_array` or `tolist()` methods do not produce the correct values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it accurately represents the characteristics of the block for proper comparison. Additionally, we should confirm that the sorting operation correctly aligns the blocks for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version ensures that the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple with string representation of `dtype` and a list of `mgr_locs`, which can be used for comparison. The sorting based on this representation should be more robust.
