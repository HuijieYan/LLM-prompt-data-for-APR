### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing the blocks within each BlockManager. However, the bug arises because the sorting of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables is not considering the order of the blocks within each BlockManager. This means that if the order of blocks is different between `self` and `other` BlockManagers, the function will incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data in the sorting process. By considering both the dtype name and the actual block data in the sorting key, we can ensure that blocks are compared based on their content as well. This modification will prevent the function from incorrectly returning `True` when comparing BlockManagers with different block orders.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block data in sorting key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block data in the sorting process, the corrected version of the function ensures that blocks are compared based on both their dtype name and actual data content. This fix addresses the bug and prevents incorrect comparisons based on block order.
