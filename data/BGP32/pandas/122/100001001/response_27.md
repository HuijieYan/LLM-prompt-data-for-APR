### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely occurring because the `canonicalize` function is not properly handling the `block.mgr_locs` attribute while sorting the blocks. The `BlockPlacement` object does not have a direct string representation that can be used for sorting, causing the `canonicalize` function to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `Block` object. One approach could be to convert the `mgr_locs` attribute to a format that can be used for sorting, such as converting it to a list. 

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the buggy function with an updated `canonicalize` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to handle mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By properly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the function should now work as expected.
