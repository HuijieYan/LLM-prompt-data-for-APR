### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. The issue arises from the fact that the `mgr_locs` attribute used in the sorting process may not be directly comparable. This can lead to incorrect comparisons between blocks, causing the function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting key used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` comparison is based on directly comparable attributes of the blocks. One approach could be to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` for comparison, eliminating the `mgr_locs` attribute from the sorting key.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype.name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the sorting key only depend on the block's `dtype.name`, we ensure that the comparison is based on directly comparable attributes, addressing the bug in the original function.
