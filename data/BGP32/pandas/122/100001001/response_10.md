### Explanation:
The buggy function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks by canonicalizing them based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.

In Case 1, the input parameters show that `self` and `other` have the same `axes`, but their `blocks` are swapped. The bug lies in how the blocks are sorted and compared.
- The function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines dtype.name and mgr_locs. However, the mgr_locs comparison can cause issues because it converts the mgr_locs to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which may not be consistent.
- This inconsistency in converting `mgr_locs` to a list affects the sorting order and leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, avoid comparing `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` due to its inconsistency and the possibility of being non-deterministic. Instead, use a more stable and deterministic method to compare and sort the blocks.

### Corrected version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now only considers `dtype.name` for sorting, eliminating the dependency on `mgr_locs`. This change ensures a more stable comparison process for the blocks, addressing the buggy behavior observed in Case 1.
