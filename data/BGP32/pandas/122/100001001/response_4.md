### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the `canonicalize` function which is used to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not handle the `block` properly, leading to a mismatch in order when comparing blocks for equality.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `block` object that includes both `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. We should sort the blocks based on both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now properly considers both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_slice()` when sorting the blocks. This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing for equality.
