### Bug Analysis
The buggy function aims to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The function iterates through the axes of both objects and then sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs.

However, the bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of the axes between `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. Even if the axes have the same content, the function fails to correctly compare them due to a possible mismatch in the order of axes.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes comparison considers the order of axes while checking for equality. One way to achieve this is by directly comparing the axes of both objects without sorting them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the axes without sorting them, the function should now correctly identify if the two BlockManager objects are equal.
