### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent `all` function call. The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is defined and used to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, and when sorting the blocks, it does not handle the case where the dtype names are the same for different blocks.

In the given input values, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` both contain an `IntBlock` and an `ObjectBlock`. However, when sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, the order might get mixed up due to identical dtype names. Therefore, the comparison between sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` at the end may result in a False negative even if the blocks are actually equal.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for cases where blocks have the same dtype name. One approach is to concatenate the dtype name and mgr_locs, ensuring a unique identification for each block. Here is the corrected version of the function with the modified `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to handle blocks with the same dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (f"{block.dtype.name}_{block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()}")

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the blocks will be sorted uniquely based on both dtype name and mgr_locs, ensuring a correct comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
