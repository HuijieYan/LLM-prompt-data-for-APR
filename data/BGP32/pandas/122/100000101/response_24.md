### Analysis
- The function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their `axes` and `blocks`.
- It checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal first.
- Then, it compares each axis within a zip of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
- It consolidates both `self` and `other` BlockManagers before comparing the number of blocks.
- It then sorts the blocks based on a `canonicalize` function and compares each block in sorted order.

### Bug explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the `canonicalize` function that is attempting to sort the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This would work if `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` uniquely identify each block. However, due to the nature of the `Block` objects or the way they are created, these attributes don't provide a reliable way to guarantee block identity.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to find a more reliable way to compare and sort the blocks. One approach could be generating a unique identifier for each block based on its content, metadata, or other characteristics that truly distinguish one block from another.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def generate_block_key(block):
        # Generate a unique key for each block based on its content
        return hash((block._get_values(), block._maybe_infer_dtype()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=generate_block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=generate_block_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `generate_block_key` function generates a unique key for each block based on its content and metadata. This ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly based on their actual uniqueness.
