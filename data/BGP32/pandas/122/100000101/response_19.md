### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManagers. We need to ensure that the comparison between the blocks is done correctly. One possible solution is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block shape along with dtype and manager locations to ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, shape, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block shape in the `canonicalize` function, we should be able to correctly identify identical blocks while comparing the BlockManagers.
