The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The blocks are sorted and compared based on the tuple generated by the `canonicalize` function, which should include the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the actual comparison is performed using the `.equals()` method directly on each block without considering the type name and `mgr_locs` tuple.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is done based on the canonicalized tuple of the block's type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly creates a tuple with the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. This tuple is then used for the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. Finally, the equality comparison is done for each pair of blocks based on this canonicalized tuple.
