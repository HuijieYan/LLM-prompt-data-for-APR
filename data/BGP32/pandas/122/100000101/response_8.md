The buggy function seems to be trying to compare two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the canonicalize function, where it tries to access the 'mgr_locs' attribute directly from the block object without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if 'mgr_locs' is not present in all types of blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to handle cases where 'mgr_locs' may not exist in certain block types. We can use a conditional check to ensure that only blocks with 'mgr_locs' attribute are considered for sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs'):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, None)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the canonicalize function gracefully handles cases where 'mgr_locs' attribute may not exist in certain block types, preventing the AttributeError. The function now should satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
