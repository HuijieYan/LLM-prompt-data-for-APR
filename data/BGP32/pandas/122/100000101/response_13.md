The buggy function is trying to compare two BlockManager objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks. The bug in this implementation is that the block comparison is not considering the correct ordering.

The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize` that sorts blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. However, the comparison of the blocks is done without considering this ordering, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done in the same order after sorting them. One way to achieve this is to zip the sorted self_blocks and other_blocks together before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on the custom function `canonicalize` before comparing them. This way, the comparison is done in a consistent order, resolving the bug in the original implementation.
