## Bug Analysis
The buggy function "equals" compares two instances of BlockManager objects to check for equality. The function compares the axes, blocks, and their contents to determine if the two BlockManagers are equal. The bug seems to be in the canonicalize function that sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. The bug might occur if the dtype names or mgr_locs are incorrect or not properly handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function correctly handles dtype names and mgr_locs. We should also verify that the sorting of blocks based on these attributes does not introduce any discrepancies that affect the final equality comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modified the canonicalize function to use the type name of the block and block.mgr_locs directly without converting to a list. This should ensure that the sorting is done correctly. We also changed the sorting key to use the type name of the block for proper comparison. The rest of the function remains the same as the original buggy version.
