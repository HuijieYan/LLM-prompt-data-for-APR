The buggy function is attempting to compare two BlockManager objects, self and other, to check if they are equal. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes in self and other are equal, then it proceeds to compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

The bug in the function is due to the use of the canonicalize function, which is sorting the blocks based on the combination of dtype.name and mgr_locs, but mgr_locs is being accessed incorrectly causing the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that mgr_locs is correctly accessed and utilized within the canonicalize function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now correctly accesses mgr_locs for each block. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as expected based on the given input and output values.
