### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is expected to compare two `BlockManager` objects, including their axes and blocks. It should check if the axes are of equal length and if the blocks are equal in content.

### Identified issue:
1. The `canonicalize` function uses `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for sorting the `Block` objects. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not directly accessible in the provided context, leading to a potential AttributeError.
2. The implementation of `canonicalize` has not been provided, which can cause issues in sorting the blocks correctly.

### Bug explanation:
The issue occurs when trying to access the `mgr_locs` attribute within the `canonicalize` function. Since the attribute is not directly accessible from the `block` object, it raises an AttributeError. This prevents the correct comparison of blocks in the sorting process.

### Suggested fix:
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessible within the `canonicalize` function. If `mgr_locs` is not directly available for a `Block` object, an alternative approach to properly sorting the blocks should be implemented.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version avoids the direct usage of `mgr_locs` and instead uses the block's `values` (assuming it contains the comparable data) for sorting and comparison. By implementing a modified `canonicalize` function, the function aims to correctly compare the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.
