### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to check the equality between two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the issue lies in the `canonicalize` function within the function. The `canonicalize` function is using `block.dtype.name` which returns the dtype name as a string, but it should be using `block.dtype` in order to properly compare the dtype of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the dtype of blocks by using `block.dtype` instead of `block.dtype.name`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
