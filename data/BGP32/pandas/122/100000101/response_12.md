### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from comparing two BlockManager objects. The function is designed to compare the axes and blocks of two BlockManager instances to determine if they are equal. However, the bug occurs when comparing the blocks within each BlockManager. The function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs values before comparing them. This sorting can lead to mismatched blocks being paired for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared based on their original order within each BlockManager. We should remove the sorting step based on dtype.name and mgr_locs values. By comparing the blocks directly without altering their order, we can accurately determine if the two BlockManager instances are equal.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the unnecessary sorting of blocks, the corrected function now directly compares the blocks in their original order within each BlockManager instance. This will ensure that the function accurately determines if the two BlockManager instances are equal based on their respective axes and blocks.
