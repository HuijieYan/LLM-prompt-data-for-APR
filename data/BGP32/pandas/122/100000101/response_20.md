### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function arises from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function compares blocks based on their data type name and the manager locations, using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is expected to be a `BlockPlacement` object, not an array, which causes an error during sorting. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract and compare the relevant information for sorting the blocks. Specifically, we should handle the `mgr_locs` attribute appropriately to avoid the error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We modified the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their `_type` attribute (data type name) and `mgr_locs` directly without converting it to a list.
- We addressed the issue causing the bug and ensured that the function now correctly sorts and compares the blocks.
