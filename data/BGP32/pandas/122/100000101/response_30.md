### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug lies in the comparison logic, as it is incorrectly sorting the blocks of each BlockManager before checking for equality. This sorting can lead to a mismatch in block order, resulting in a false negative equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of comparing the blocks. Instead of sorting the blocks before comparison, we should compare them directly while iterating through them. This way, we ensure that the blocks are compared in their original order, maintaining the integrity of the comparison.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will directly compare the blocks of both BlockManager objects without sorting them, ensuring a proper equality check.
