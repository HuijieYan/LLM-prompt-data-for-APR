## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The bug arises when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which attempts to create a tuple for comparison. The bug is caused by accessing an attribute `block.dtype.name` directly without considering that `block.dtype` might not have the attribute `name`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access `block.dtype.name`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `canonicalize` function, we need to handle the case where `block.dtype` does not have the attribute `name` properly. We can modify the function to check if the `name` attribute exists and then return the tuple using the available information. If the attribute doesn't exist, we can handle it gracefully by returning a default value.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Fix the canonicalize function to handle block.dtype.name not always being available
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = block.dtype.name if hasattr(block.dtype, 'name') else ""
        return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the situation where `block.dtype.name` does not exist, preventing the AttributeError and ensuring the correct comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
