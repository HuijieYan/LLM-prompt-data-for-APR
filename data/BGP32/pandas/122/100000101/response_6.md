The bug in the provided function lies in the 'canonicalize' function. The current implementation fails to compare block locations properly, resulting in incorrect comparison outcomes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'canonicalize' function to include block locations for proper comparison. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function accounts for block placement during comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.encode('ascii'))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should now properly compare the block locations during the equals check, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
