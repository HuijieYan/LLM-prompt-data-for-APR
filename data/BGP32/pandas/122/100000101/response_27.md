### Bug explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs because the `canonicalize` function is attempting to access the `mgr_locs` attribute directly from the `block` object. However, the `block` object is an instance of the `IntBlock` class, which does not have a `mgr_locs` attribute. This leads to an AttributeError, causing the function to fail.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the different types of blocks correctly and extract the necessary information to compare them.

### Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to handle different types of blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `canonicalize` function is modified to handle different block types appropriately, ensuring that the function does not raise an AttributeError and can compare the blocks accurately.
