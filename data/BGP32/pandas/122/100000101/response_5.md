### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, during the comparison of blocks, the function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and `mgr_locs`. The bug lies in the fact that the `canonicalize` function incorrectly accesses `mgr_locs` attribute, which does not exist in the `Block` object. This leads to an `AttributeError` when the function tries to access `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect usage of `mgr_locs` and modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks solely based on their data type. We can omit the `mgr_locs` as it is not a valid attribute of the `Block` object. Then, we need to update the comparison logic accordingly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only the dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With the `canonicalize` function modification, the corrected function should now properly compare the two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks, without trying to access an invalid attribute.
