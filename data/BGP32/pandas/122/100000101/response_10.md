The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparison.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` values. However, `mgr_locs` is being incorrectly accessed as a method instead of an attribute, leading to a AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correct the access of `mgr_locs` as an attribute. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.block_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that `mgr_locs` is correctly accessed as an attribute within the `canonicalize` function.
