### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the comparison of block elements in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is performed using the `equals` method, which may not provide the expected result due to inconsistencies in the block ordering.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a strategy involving the traversal of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using consistent ordering based on the block type and locations is necessary. Sorting the blocks based on a consistent key before the equality comparison should address the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Using class name for block type
        
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function ensures that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists are sorted based on a consistent key derived from the block type and locations before performing the equality comparison. This will address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
