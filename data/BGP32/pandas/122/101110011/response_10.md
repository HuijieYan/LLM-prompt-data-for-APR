### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two BlockManager objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly instead of `False` when comparing two different DataFrames.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method in returning `True` instead of `False` for identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function which combines the datatype name and `mgr_locs`. When blocs are sorted based on this combination, identical blocks with different locations may appear in different order leading to incorrect equality comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks consistently without considering `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to only sort blocks based on the datatype name without including `mgr_locs`.
- This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are considered equal during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing methods ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Only consider datatype for sorting blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making this change in the `canonicalize` function to only sort blocks based on datatype name and excluding `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the `equals` method will now handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly.
