### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and their elements.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two `DataFrame` objects that are not equal, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`, but it fails.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails due to `assert True is False` which means the `df1.equals(df2)` returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of blocks with different locations leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when comparing blocks of `DataFrame` objects. Even though the blocks are not in the same order, the comparison is still showing them as equal due to the sorting method used in canonicalizing the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is not affected by the block locations. One strategy could be to compare the blocks directly without taking their locations into account.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the comparison is done directly on the blocks without sorting based on their locations, fixing the bug of returning `True` wrongly.
