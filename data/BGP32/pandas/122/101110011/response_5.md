### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in a different order to test the `equals` method, expecting it to return False. However, the buggy code is improperly comparing the DataFrames which results in a failure.
3. The error message shows that the comparison of `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returns True instead of False.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes `DataFrame.equals()` to incorrectly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug seems to stem from the improper logic in the `equals` function where it fails to correctly compare blocks and their respective locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class improperly comparing DataFrames even when they have different block locations, resulting in a wrong True output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method compares DataFrames properly, considering both the block content and the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.to_frame().to_string(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method properly compares DataFrames considering both the content and block locations, addressing the bug.
