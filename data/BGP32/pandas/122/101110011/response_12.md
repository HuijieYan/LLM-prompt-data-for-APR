### Fixing the Bug:

The bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return incorrect results, leading to a failing test as shown above. The issue reported on GitHub also highlights the discrepancy in the returned results.

To fix this bug, we need to consider the blocks within the DataFrames `self` and `other` during comparison. The issue arises from identical blocks with different locations not being handled correctly in the `equals()` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_block_manager()._consolidate_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `_get_block_manager()._consolidate_type` attribute for ordering the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled during comparison.

By making this change, the corrected `equals()` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
