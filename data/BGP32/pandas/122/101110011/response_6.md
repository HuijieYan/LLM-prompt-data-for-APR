### Identification of potential errors:
1. Comparison of DataFrames with different values in columns 'a' and 'b'.
2. The buggy function 'equals' in the BlockManager class does not properly handle this case.

### Explanation of the bug:
The failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal()' creates two DataFrames, df1 and df2, with different values in their columns 'a' and 'b'. When calling df1.equals(df2), the buggy function compares the blocks within the DataFrames. However, instead of returning False when the DataFrames have different values, it mistakenly returns True due to the bug in handling the comparison of blocks.

The assertion error occurs because the buggy function fails to detect the difference in values and concludes that the DataFrames are equal, leading to the assertion error asserting True is False.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the 'equals' function in the BlockManager class to compare the values of the DataFrames in addition to comparing the blocks.
2. Ensure that False is returned if any discrepancies in values are found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        for col in self.columns:
            if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
                return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version of the 'equals' function, the comparison will now include checking the values of the DataFrames' columns. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal()' pass successfully.
