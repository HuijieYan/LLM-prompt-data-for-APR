### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. It compares two `BlockManager` objects and checks if they are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal, which fails.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly, causing the test to fail.
4. The GitHub issue provides additional context about the bug, indicating that even when the blocks are identical but have different locations, the `equals` method erroneously returns `True`.
5. The cause of the bug lies in how the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which results in the incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to update the `canonicalize` function to ignore the `mgr_locs` attribute during sorting as it causes the incorrect equality comparison.
2. By modifying the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that the comparison considers block content instead of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the equality of `BlockManager` objects based on their block content, ignoring their locations, and pass the failing test.
