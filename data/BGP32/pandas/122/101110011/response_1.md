### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` compares two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block ordering.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped (`df1` and `df2`) and asserts that they are not equal. However, the buggy implementation of `equals` considers them equal due to the block ordering issue.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the mismatch in behavior of `DataFrame.equals()` and the expected output in this scenario.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it handles the ordering of blocks during comparison. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, if the blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison incorrectly considers them equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs modification. Instead of comparing based on current block ordering, the function should ensure that each block matches the corresponding block in the other instance, disregarding block ordering.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=len)  # Sort blocks by length for comparison
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=len)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction to the `equals` function, it should now compare the blocks based on their content rather than location. This change ensures that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test will correctly identify them as not equal.
