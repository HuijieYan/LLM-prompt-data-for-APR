### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and asserts that they are not equal using the `.equals()` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, suggesting that the function returned True while it was expected to return False.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The expected behavior is for it to return False in such cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing blocks within the function:
- The function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks based on data type and locations.
- If the input blocks have the same data but different locations, the comparison may incorrectly return True.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. We should compare the actual data in the blocks without considering the location of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [blk.values for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [blk.values for blk in other.blocks]
    
    def canonicalize(block_data):
        return (block_data.dtype, block_data.shape)

    self_blocks_data.sort(key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks_data.sort(key=canonicalize)

    return all(np.array_equal(block_data, other_block_data) for block_data, other_block_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method directly compares the data in the blocks without considering their locations. This should resolve the bug and make the comparison more accurate.

By using this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
