### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function, which is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are of the same length, then iterates over the axes to compare them one by one. After that, it consolidates the blocks inside each `BlockManager` object and sorts the blocks based on their type and location. Finally, it compares each block in sorted order to check for equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects them to be not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug is causing the function to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to correctly handle the case where blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block locations, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, despite having different positions.

This fix should address the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
