### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class, but it fails to correctly determine equality due to a sorting issue with the blocks.
2. The bug arises from sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which relies on `dtype.name` as a key and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as the second key. This sorting doesn't guarantee correct block alignment.
3. The failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, tries to compare two dataframes with different values for columns `a` and `b`, expecting them to be unequal. However, the buggy function erroneously returns True due to the misalignment issue in block sorting.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are correctly aligned and compared, addressing the sorting inconsistency that leads to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on indexes for accurate comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block._block._values.index)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block._block._values.index)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on indexes rather than `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we ensure that they remain correctly aligned during comparison, resolving the bug and ensuring accurate equality comparisons.
