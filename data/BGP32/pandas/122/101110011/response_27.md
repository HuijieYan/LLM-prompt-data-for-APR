### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two BlockManagers for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values but the same columns.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
4. The GitHub issue describes the discrepancy in the `equals` method's behavior compared to the expected output.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It fails to properly compare the blocks of the BlockManagers due to a sorting issue with blocks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks of the BlockManagers are correctly sorted before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManagers and pass the failing test.
