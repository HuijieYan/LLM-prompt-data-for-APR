### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library is causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames that are actually not equal. This bug is also reported in GitHub issue GH28839.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class where the comparison between two DataFrames is incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the faulty comparison logic used in the `equals` function. The function fails to accurately determine the equality of the DataFrames by incorrectly comparing the location of blocks while deciding whether the DataFrames are equal or not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure that the equality check considers the actual values in the DataFrames rather than the locations of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare the blocks for actual equality
        return all(
            block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

By comparing the values of the blocks (`block.values`), we ensure the DataFrames are effectively compared based on their content instead of their location.

This corrected version should address the bug in the `equals` function and make it return the expected results.
