### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. This method is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The error seems to be related to comparing blocks within each `BlockManager`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different values. The test then calls `df1.equals(df2)` and asserts that the result is `False`. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, indicating a bug in the `equals` method.
4. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" corresponds to this bug.
5. The bug seems to stem from the ordering of blocks based on `canonicalize` function and may lead to incorrect comparison results.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within each `BlockManager` are correctly compared. One approach is to rely on a different approach to comparing blocks that does not rely on sorting the blocks by `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of blocks is now done directly without sorting, which should resolve the bug.
