### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class checks if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks after sorting them by type name and manager locations.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method, which fails.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because the method returns `True` instead of `False`, pointing to a failure in the comparison logic within the `equals` method.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar bug report where identical blocks with different locations were mistakenly considered equal.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `equals` fails to correctly identify DataFrames as not equal when they have the same blocks with different locations. This is due to incorrect handling of block sorting based on type name and locations in the comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two BlockManagers correctly accounts for identical blocks with different locations. One way to address this issue is to override the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class and modify the block comparison logic to consider block equality based on content rather than locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.tobytes()

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, we compare the block content using `tobytes()` instead of manager locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
