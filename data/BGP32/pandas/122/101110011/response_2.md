### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` using their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns `a` and `b` having different types of values in different order.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that there is a bug in the `equals` method that is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` for DataFrames with different values but identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug is due to the way the blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to modify the way blocks are compared in the `equals` method to consider the actual values of the blocks rather than just the dtype names and locations.
2. Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and locations might cause identical blocks with different values to be considered equal.
3. We should sort the blocks based on the content of each block rather than just the dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()  # Modify to use values to compare blocks

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After making this change, re-run the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. It should now pass without raising an assertion error.
