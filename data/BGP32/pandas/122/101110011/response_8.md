### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The `equals` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects them to be not equal. The test fails with an assertion error since the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` even when comparing DataFrames with different values due to how it sorts and compares the blocks without considering their actual content.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than just their order.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare sorted blocks based on content
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By updating the `equals` method to compare the content of the blocks rather than their order, we can fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
