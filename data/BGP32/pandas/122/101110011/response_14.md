### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `BlockManager` class is trying to compare blocks within two `BlockManager` objects but is failing to do so in the test case provided.
2. The bug is causing `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` to fail in the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because `True` is being returned instead of `False` for the equality comparison between `df1` and `df2`.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem that even if blocks in two DataFrames are identical, the `equals` method returns `True` if the blocks have different locations. This mismatches the expected behavior.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the way the `equals` method is handling the comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` objects. The sorting of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations is causing the incorrect equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function which sorts blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This sorting causes blocks with the same content but different locations to be considered as not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects directly without prior sorting based on dtype name and manager locations. This will ensure that the equality comparison considers the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The correction involves removing the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations and directly comparing the blocks within the two `BlockManager` objects.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
