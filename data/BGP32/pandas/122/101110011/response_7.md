### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is intended to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, sorts and compares the blocks in the two instances for equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` tries to assert that two DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns `True`.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion for `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, leading to further details on the comparison done by the function.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy in the `equals` function behavior and the expected output.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function within `BlockManager` compares the data blocks based on their type name and memory locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks iteratively, rather than relying on the sorting by type name and memory locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With the corrected version, the `equals` function will directly compare the content of the blocks instead of relying on the sorting by type name and memory locations, fixing the bug highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
