### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` compares two DataFrame instances with different values for columns 'a' and 'b', expecting them to be unequal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True` for equality.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, showing the mismatch between expected and actual results.
5. The GitHub issue outlines the problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which matches the symptom observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises in the `equals` function due to the inconsistent comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The function does not handle comparing blocks with different locations properly, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider block order and locations for equality check. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.values.tobytes() == oblock.values.tobytes() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the `tobytes()` method to compare the actual block values for equality, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are treated as unequal.

By applying this modification, the `equals` function will now correctly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
