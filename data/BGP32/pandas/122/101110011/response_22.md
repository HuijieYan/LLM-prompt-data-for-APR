### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It compares axes, consolidates the objects, and then compares blocks within them.
3. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`. The error message shows that the assertion fails with the message `assert True is False`.
4. The issue in GitHub describes how `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug in the current implementation does not take into account the different block locations when comparing blocks inside the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class not considering the block locations when comparing blocks. This leads to `equals` returning `True` when it should return `False` due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take into account both the block type and the block locations when sorting the blocks to ensure accurate comparison. By considering both the block type and locations, identical blocks with different locations will not be mistakenly treated as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().ravel()))
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying how the `canonicalize` function captures the block locations, the corrected version will properly detect and return `False` for identical blocks with different locations, resolving the bug.
