## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
2. The bug arises due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which can lead to unconsolidated blocks being wrongly considered equal.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` demonstrates the issue by creating two DataFrames with columns in different positions and asserting that they are not equal. The error message shows that the comparison returns `True` when it should be `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function to consider all relevant block properties to ensure accurate equality comparisons.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` function will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider additional block properties for accurate comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to ensure the equality check accounts for all block attributes.
3. Implement the changes in the `equals` function to guarantee correct behavior when comparing two DataFrames.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on multiple attributes to ensure accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape, block._fastpath, block.is_ref, block.consolidated)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
