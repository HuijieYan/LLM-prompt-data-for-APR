### Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is responsible for comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The function attempts to determine equality between the two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and the contents of the blocks.

### Error Location:
The function fails to correctly compare `DataFrame` objects due to an issue in handling blocks while comparing them.
The error is specifically in the comparison of DataFrames when their column order differs.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects if their blocks have identical data but different locations.
2. The issue arises from how the `equals` method handles block sorting and comparison, leading to the incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug:
1. Identify the blocks correctly.
2. Change the method for comparing blocks to handle different block locations.
3. Implement a more robust block comparison method to ensure accurate equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.size, tuple(block.dtypes), hash(block.values.tobytes()))
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function in the block comparison logic, we can generate a unique key for each block to compare blocks of `DataFrame` objects irrespective of their original positions. This change should address the bug and ensure the correct evaluation of equality between `DataFrame` objects.
