### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class from the `managers.py` file of pandas has a bug that causes it to return True even when the blocks have different locations. This bug leads to the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` from the `test_internals.py` file, which expects the `equals()` method to return False when two DataFrames have different values.

The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on their types and location tuples using the `canonicalize` function. However, it doesn't consider the actual content of the blocks when comparing them. As a result, DataFrames with the same values but different block locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the `equals(self, other)` function to consider both block types/locations and the actual content of the blocks when comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. By comparing the content of each block as well as their order, we can ensure that equal blocks are correctly identified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)  # Include block values in sorting criteria

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function that considers both block locations and content, the failing test should now pass successfully.

This fix ensures that DataFrames with the same values but different locations will be correctly identified as not equal.
