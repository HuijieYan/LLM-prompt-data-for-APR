### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py` of the pandas library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The failing test function creates two dataframes with columns 'a' and 'b' having different initial values and then checks if they are equal using the `df1.equals(df2)` method.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and it displays unexpected results.
5. The GitHub issue mentions that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method arises due to comparing blocks with different locations but containing the same values. The sorting mechanism used in the function does not consider these different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting. The function should consider the actual values stored in the blocks rather than just their types and locations. By comparing the block values first and then sorting, we can ensure correct equality evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_numpy().tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method uses the `to_numpy().tobytes()` method to compare the actual block values when sorting. This approach ensures that blocks containing the same data but at different locations are properly evaluated for equality.
