### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames that are not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the actual output of `df1.equals(df2)` is `True` instead of the expected `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem where the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly for two DataFrames that are not equal due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method is caused by sorting the blocks using a `canonicalize` function based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises because identical blocks with different locations could be sorted differently, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the sorting mechanism for the blocks in a way that accounts for different block locations. One possible approach is to compare the blocks directly without relying on sorting based on locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison will be based on the equality of blocks directly without sorting by locations, resolving the issue of returning `True` incorrectly for unequal DataFrames.
