### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug is causing the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` demonstrates the incorrect behavior, where it expects the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` to be not equal, but the buggy `equals` method returns `True`.
5. The error message points out that `assert True is False`, indicating the unexpected `True` result from the comparison.
6. The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" covers this problem, showing that the expected output should be `False` when comparing dataframes with different block locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks inside the `equals` method using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting introduces a scenario where identical blocks with different locations end up being considered equal. This is against the expected behavior where location information should be considered in the comparison.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information in the tuple. This modification ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are not treated as equal during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.index)

# Fixed equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the above correction, the `equals` method will properly consider the block's locations in the comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly deemed as equal.
