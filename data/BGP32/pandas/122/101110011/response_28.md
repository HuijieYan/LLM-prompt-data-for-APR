### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes with different values but in the same order, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The failing test produces an assertion error, indicating that the `equals` method erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing data frames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class when comparing block equality between two instances. The method fails to differentiate between blocks with identical data but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` method:
1. Ensure that the comparison takes block locations into account to differentiate between blocks with identical data.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in determining block identity.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class methods and declarations...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include both the block type and locations, the corrected `equals` method now accounts for blocks with identical data but different locations, ensuring a proper comparison. This correction should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to erroneous equality comparisons.
