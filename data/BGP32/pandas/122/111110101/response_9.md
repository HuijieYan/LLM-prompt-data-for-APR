The bug in the `equals` function is related to sorting the blocks within `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. The bug causes the `equals` function to fail when comparing two DataFrames where the values are stored in different blocks compared to the expected order.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing them. Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__hash__(),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their values before comparison, preventing the issue caused by unconsolidated blocks being out of order. This correction should make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
