### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The error occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the `blocks` attribute in both instances. The comparison of the `blocks` attribute is sensitive to the order of blocks, which may differ even if the actual content is the same.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `equals` function compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` first. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.
2. It then iterates over each pair of axes in `self_axes` and `other_axes` and checks if they are equal. If any pair is not equal, the function returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates both instances using `_consolidate_inplace` method.
4. Next, the function checks the lengths of the `blocks` attribute of both instances. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.
5. To compare the actual content, the function sorts the blocks in both instances based on a canonical order created by `canonicalize` function, which considers the type name and `mgr_locs`.
6. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks and checks if each pair of blocks is equal. If any pair is not equal, the function returns `False`.

The bug arises from the incorrect block ordering due to comparing multiple block properties. This leads to the failing test case where two dataframes with the same content are considered unequal.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by considering the content of the blocks rather than their properties such as type and `mgr_locs`. One way to achieve this is to directly compare the content of corresponding blocks in both instances without relying on sorting.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting them based on properties that may not be indicative of their actual content, the corrected version ensures the accurate comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
