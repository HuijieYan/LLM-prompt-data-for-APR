### Bug Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug seems to be with the comparison logic within the function.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes of both `BlockManager` instances are the same, then compares each axis. It then consolidates both instances in place and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares each block in the two instances.
3. The bug is likely related to the comparison of blocks. The error message indicates that the function returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing the blocks. This results in the failing test.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly without leading to a `True` comparison. This can be achieved by refining the block comparison logic.
5. I will correct the function to compare the blocks in a way that avoids the bug.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.ndim, block._cython_table.evict())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to uniquely identify blocks from their dimensions and cython table state, we ensure a proper sorting order that is maintained during block comparison. This corrected approach should properly compare the blocks, resolving the bug.
