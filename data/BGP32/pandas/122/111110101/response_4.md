The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the order of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function tries to compare the blocks by sorting them based on their type name and locations, but this leads to incorrect comparison due to the mismatch in the order of blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function so that the blocks are compared correctly even if their order is different. One way to achieve this is to compare each block in `self` against all blocks in `other` to find a matching block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a set to store blocks from other that have been matched
    matched_blocks = set()

    for block1 in self.blocks:
        block1_matched = False
        for block2 in other.blocks:
            if block1.equals(block2) and block2 not in matched_blocks:
                block1_matched = True
                matched_blocks.add(block2)
                break
        if not block1_matched:
            return False

    return True
```

This modified version iterates through each block in `self` and tries to find a matching block in `other`. If a matching block is found and it hasn't been matched before, it considers the blocks equal. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case provided.
