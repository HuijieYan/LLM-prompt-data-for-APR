### Explanation:
1. The `BlockManager` class contains an `equals` method that compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances using the `pd.DataFrame` constructor, generating dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The test then asserts that `df1` does not equal `df2`.
3. The error occurs because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks before comparing them by defining a `canonicalize` function that properly sorts the blocks based on their type name and location.
5. Based on the analysis, we will update the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to properly compare the blocks. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison of blocks within each `BlockManager` instance should be correct, and the failing test should pass.
