There are two potential bugs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:
1. The function is being called recursively within itself (due to having the same name as the `equals` method from the class), which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The comparison logic within the function might not be handling block comparisons correctly.

To fix these bugs and ensure that the `equals` method compares blocks correctly, we can rename the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to `block_equals` to avoid recursive calls. Then, we need to modify the logic within the `equals` method to compare blocks correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def block_equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Ensure that you also update the method calls within the class to use `block_equals` instead of `equals`.

With these changes, the corrected `equals` method should now pass the failing test provided.
