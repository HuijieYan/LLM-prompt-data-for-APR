The bug in the `equals` function arises due to a discrepancy in the block order comparison between `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The function compares the blocks based on their data content, but it fails to consider the order and type of the blocks which can be non-consistent due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the type of block and its locations when comparing the blocks. By doing this, we ensure that the block order comparison is accurate and consistent regardless of the block type.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block type and location in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure a consistent comparison of the blocks. This amended version should now pass the failing test and correctly compare the two BlockManagers based on their block order.
