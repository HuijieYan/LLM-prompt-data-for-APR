### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug lies in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares blocks from `self` and `other` instances by sorting them and then checking equality. However, the bug arises because the sorting key used (`canonicalize` function) is not based on a proper representation of the block.

### Root Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function compares blocks using the block's `dtype.name` and its `mgr_locs`, which are not always sufficient to uniquely identify the blocks. This may lead to incorrect comparisons and the wrong behavior of the `equals` method.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to redefine the `canonicalize` function to generate a representation of the block that uniquely characterizes it. This could involve including additional information beyond just the dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new canonicalize function that uniquely represents the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)  # Unique representation using type and values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include a more unique representation of the blocks, we ensure that the comparison between the blocks in the `equals` method is accurate and based on suitable criteria. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
