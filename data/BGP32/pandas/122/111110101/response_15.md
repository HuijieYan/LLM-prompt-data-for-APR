## Bug analysis
The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are the same, then it consolidates the internal data using `_consolidate_inplace`, compares the number of blocks, and finally compares the blocks by sorting them based on type and location information.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns in different orders and expects them to be considered unequal.

### Identified issues:
1. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, but it does not consider the order of axes which can lead to false positives.
2. The function sorts and compares blocks based on dtype and location, but the comparison may break if the order of blocks is different.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
1. Update the equality check for axes to compare their contents and order.
2. Modify the sorting of blocks to consider both dtype and location for a reliable comparison.
3. Ensure that the comparison directly uses the data from the `Block` instances rather than comparing objects which may not yield the correct result.

## Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Convert manager locations to a tuple to correctly compare block locations
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on axes, consolidated data, number of blocks, and sorted blocks by dtype and location. It should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
