### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function first compares the `self.axes` and `other.axes` attributes to ensure they have the same length.
3. Then it calls `_consolidate_inplace` method on both `self` and `other` instances.
4. Next, it compares the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
5. The function then sorts the `blocks` attribute of both instances based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize` that sorts blocks by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` converted to a list.
6. Finally, it checks the equality of corresponding blocks from `self` and `other`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing the order of blocks in `self` and `other` instances after sorting. The `canonicalize` function is not handling the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly, leading to the `equals` method returning incorrect results.

### Fix:
1. The `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly handle `mgr_locs`.
2. Converting `mgr_locs` to a list should use `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function, converting `mgr_locs` to a list, the comparison of blocks should now work correctly, and the corrected function should pass the failing test case.
