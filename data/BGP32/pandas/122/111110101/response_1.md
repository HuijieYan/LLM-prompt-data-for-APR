### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, the number of blocks, and the contents of each block. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing incorrectly.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, which is expected.
- The failing assertion shows that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`, indicating that the buggy function is not correctly detecting inequality between the two BlockManagers.
- The issue might be related to how block equality is being checked in the function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. The incorrect comparison logic is leading to a wrong equality result.
- The equality comparison should consider the values inside the blocks for correctness.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `equals` function to compare the values inside the blocks for equality.
- Update the logic to compare individual blocks for equality, as well as the block structure.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return tuple(
            sorted(
                (b.values, b.mgr_locs) for b in blocks
            )
        )

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_values1, block_values2) and loc1 == loc2
        for (block_values1, loc1), (block_values2, loc2) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should handle the comparison more accurately, considering both the block values and the block locations, ensuring the correct behavior for the `equals` function.
