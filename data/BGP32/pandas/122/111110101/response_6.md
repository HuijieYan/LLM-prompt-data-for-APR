The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, with different values in corresponding columns and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.

### Issues:
1. The comparison between axes of `self` and `other` is not accurate. The axes should be compared individually.
2. The comparison of blocks is problematic since the `canonicalize` function does not handle the case where there are different types in the blocks.
3. The failing test provides clear evidence that the current `equals` implementation is faulty since it expects the comparison to return `False`, but it fails.

### Strategies to fix the bug:
1. Modify the check for axes equality to compare individual axes instead of the lists.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the block types for distinction.
3. Ensure that the correct block comparison logic is implemented.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating these changes, the function should now accurately compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects for equality, passing the failing test and providing the expected behavior.
