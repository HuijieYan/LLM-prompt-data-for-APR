### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates the blocks and compares them in a canonicalized manner.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns `a` and `b`, but with different values. It then asserts that the `equals` function should return `False`.
4. The error arises because the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks due to potential inconsistencies in ordering.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks of both instances before performing the equality check to avoid inconsistencies in ordering.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this corrected version, the `equals` function should perform the comparison of `BlockManager` instances correctly and pass the failing test case.
