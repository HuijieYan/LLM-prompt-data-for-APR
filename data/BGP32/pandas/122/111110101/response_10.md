The buggy function `equals` is trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they are equal. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug in the code:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly defined to use the method `as_array` on `mgr_locs`, but it should be `mgr_locs.values`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to properly reflect the structure of `mgr_locs`.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly in the loop.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to access `mgr_locs.values`, the comparison between blocks within the `BlockManager` instances should work correctly. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
