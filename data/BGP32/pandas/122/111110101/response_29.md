### Bug Explanation

The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the comparison between blocks. The function is checking if the sorted blocks from `self` and `other` are equal by iterating over them, but there is a discrepancy between how the blocks are sorted. The `canonicalize` function, used for sorting the blocks, doesn't correctly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, resulting in false inequality checks, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the `mgr_locs` attribute properly when sorting the blocks. This modification will ensure that the blocks are sorted in a way that allows accurate comparison between them.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the modification in the `canonicalize` function to correctly incorporate the `mgr_locs` attribute when sorting the blocks, ensuring the equality check is accurate. This fix should make the `equals` function work correctly with the provided failing test.
