### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class using their axes and blocks attributes.
2. The error occurs because the equality check on the Axes objects in `self_axes` and `other_axes` fails due to the fact that the axes are not considered equal for DataFrame objects that differ in column or index order.
3. The proposed strategy for fixing the bug involves restructuring the logic of how the comparison is done between the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = {type(b).__name__: b for b in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {type(b).__name__: b for b in other.blocks}

    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False

    for block_type, block_self in self_blocks.items():
        block_other = other_blocks[block_type]
        if not block_self.equals(block_other):
            return False

    return True
```

This fixed version compares the blocks based on their type and ensures that corresponding block types in `self` and `other` are equal before performing the equality check on each individual block.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass now.
