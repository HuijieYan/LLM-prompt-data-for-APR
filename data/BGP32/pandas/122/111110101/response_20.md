### Bug Analysis:
The bug is located in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` when they are not equal. This is evident from the failing test case where two DataFrames are being compared, and the function erroneously returns `True`.

The bug seems to stem from the fact that the function is comparing the `blocks` attribute of the two `BlockManager` objects without taking into account the order of the blocks. This leads to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with differing block orders.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects are compared in a consistent manner. Sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparison can help eliminate the issue related to block order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods and attributes remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().start)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation in the `canonicalize` function before comparison, we ensure a consistent comparison regardless of the block order, fixing the bug.
