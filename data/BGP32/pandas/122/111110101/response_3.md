## Analysis
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes, blocks, and content are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values and then checks if `df1` equals `df2`, which should return `False`.
3. The failing test is raising an `AssertionError` because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `canonicalize` function is comparing the blocks. The sorting of blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs` seems problematic.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly in terms of their content.

## Bug Fix
I will modify the way blocks are compared in the `equals` method. Since the `equals` method should first compare the axes of the `BlockManager` instances, I will check if the axes are different before comparing the blocks. Additionally, I will adjust the comparison logic for the blocks to ensure that their content is compared properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block._can_compare(other_block) or not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures proper comparison of axes and block content between two `BlockManager` instances.
