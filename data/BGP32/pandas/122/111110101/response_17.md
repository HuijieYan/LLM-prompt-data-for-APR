### Analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if the axes of `self` and `other` are the same length and if they are equal. Then it consolidates both instances in place and compares the number of blocks they have. It then sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function and compares each block pair.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` while it was expected to be `False`. This suggests that the `equals()` function is not comparing the DataFrames correctly.

### Bug
The bug in the `equals()` function lies in the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts self and other block items based on the `canonicalize()` function that relies on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the attribute `mgr_locs` does not have an `as_array` attribute, leading to an AttributeError during comparison. This causes the comparison to fail, resulting in the bug.

### Fix
To fix this bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize()` function to correctly access the location information of the blocks in a compatible way.
2. Ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is correctly accessed in the `canonicalize()` function, avoiding the AttributeError.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly accesses the location information of blocks for comparison, ensuring that the comparison of the blocks is done accurately.
