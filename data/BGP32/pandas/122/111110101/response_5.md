### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal in length and content, then proceeds to compare the blocks within them.
2. The error occurs due to the discrepancy between the values in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The order of blocks is not handled consistently, resulting in the failing test case.
3. In the failing test, two DataFrames are created with columns `a` and `b`, but the order is reversed between them. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` in this case, but it fails due to the mismatch in block order.
4. To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects consistently before comparing them.
5. We will sort the blocks in the `self` and `other` objects by a canonical method using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block type name and manager locations. Then, we will compare the blocks in a sorted manner.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))

def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

By sorting the blocks in both `self` and `other` objects before comparison, we ensure that the order is consistent and the `equals` function will return the correct result.
