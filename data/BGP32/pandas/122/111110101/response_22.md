### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their internal attributes like `axes` and `blocks`.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different column types and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, which internally calls the buggy function.

### Bug Explanation:
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances where the columns `'a'` in `df1` and `'b'` in `df2` contain values of different types (`int` and `str`).
- The buggy function `equals` compares the `blocks` within the `BlockManager` instances, which internally calls the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks using the `dtype.name`.
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not handling the case where the dtype of the blocks is different (e.g., comparing an `int64` block with an `object` block).
- The `canonicalize` function should consider the dtype as well as the block values to ensure correct comparison between blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block values along with the dtype. If the dtype is different, we should not compare the blocks and return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, consider dtype and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values along with the dtype in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with different dtypes are not erroneously considered equal, addressing the bug.
