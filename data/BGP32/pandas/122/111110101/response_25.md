The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality, but it fails to consider the case where the blocks within each `BlockManager` might not be in the same order. This leads to a false positive result when comparing two `BlockManager` instances that have the same blocks but in a different order.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` function to sort the blocks within each `BlockManager` based on a canonical representation before comparing them for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will first consolidate both `BlockManager` instances in place, then sort the blocks within each instance using a canonical representation before comparing them for equality. This approach ensures a consistent comparison even if the order of blocks is different.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should now pass as the two `DataFrame` instances have different values for columns `'a'` and `'b`.
