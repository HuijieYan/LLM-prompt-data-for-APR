Based on the error message and the expected values, the bug is likely in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. The comparison between two `BlockManager` instances seems to be failing due to the comparison not being implemented correctly or not handling the internal blocks properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances compares all their internal components correctly. This includes comparing the axes, blocks, and their contents in a consistent way.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks one by one
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare the `axes` and then compare each block in the `blocks` list of both `BlockManager` instances. This ensures a comprehensive comparison that covers all internal components.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
