### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and check if they are equal based on various criteria like axes, blocks, etc.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`) and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` gives `False`, which should be the case since the columns of the data frames are in a different order.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is not working as expected, leading to an assertion failure.
4. The bug in the function seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and their order.
5. The function should compare the blocks based on both their data type and the locations of the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic for the blocks in the `equals` function. The blocks should be ordered based on data types and block locations to ensure accurate comparison.

### Fix:
I will fix the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class by sorting the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance based on data type and block locations before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating sorting of the blocks based on both data type and locations in the `equals` function, the comparison logic will be more robust, ensuring that the blocks are compared accurately.
