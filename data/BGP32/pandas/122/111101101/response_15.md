The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The blocks need to be sorted and compared based on their data type and memory locations, ensuring the blocks are correctly aligned for comparison.

To fix the bug, we can update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and the memory locations of the blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct block attributes are accessed for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using both data type and memory locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the blocks will be correctly sorted and compared based on their data type and memory locations, ensuring an accurate comparison. This fix should resolve the failing test case provided.
