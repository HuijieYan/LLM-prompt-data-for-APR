The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to how the blocks are being compared. The code is sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block type name and manager locations. However, when sorting blocks for comparison, the presence of different block types (e.g., `IntBlock` vs. `ObjectBlock`) can lead to incorrect matching.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use the block type name only for sorting. This way, blocks of the same type will be compared correctly irrespective of their manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using only the block type name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks while ignoring their specific manager locations, ensuring that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
