The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison logic of the blocks. The function is trying to compare two sets of blocks within the BlockManager objects by sorting them based on their data type and manager locations. However, the bug occurs because the comparison operation is flawed and does not yield the correct results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic so that it correctly compares the blocks in the two BlockManager objects. We should compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` based on their dtype and manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_ftype(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared based on their dtype and manager locations correctly, hence fixing the comparison logic bug.

Now, the failing test should pass with this corrected function.
