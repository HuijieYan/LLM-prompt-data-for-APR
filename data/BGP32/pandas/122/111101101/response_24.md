The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when sorting blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. 

The bug occurs because the `._concolidate_inplace()` method is called before comparing the blocks. This can lead to inconsistencies in block comparisons as the internal structures may not be properly aligned.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to call `_consolidate_inplace()` before extracting the blocks for comparison. This ensures that the blocks are properly consolidated before sorting and comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function first makes a copy of the blocks before calling `_consolidate_inplace()`. Then, it performs the block comparisons after both sets of blocks have been properly consolidated. This should fix the bug and ensure that the comparison is done correctly.
