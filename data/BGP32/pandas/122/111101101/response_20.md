The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The bug occurs because the blocks are not being sorted correctly before comparison, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on a canonical representation before comparing them. This canonical representation should take into account the dtype and the mgr_locs (which represent the locations of blocks) to correctly order and compare the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the fixed implementation, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within `BlockManager` objects based on a defined sort order. This correction should address the failing test case provided.
