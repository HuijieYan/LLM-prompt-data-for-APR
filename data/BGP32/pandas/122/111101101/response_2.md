The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function which involves the `mgr_locs` attribute. The `mgr_locs` needs to be correctly considered in the comparison to ensure consistency.

To address this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute properly in the comparison. This can be achieved by converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple before comparing.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple before comparison in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison is consistent and correct. 

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
