### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison logic between two `BlockManager` objects. The function checks the equality of the axes and blocks of the two objects but fails to consider the order of the blocks, resulting in a mismatch even when the blocks contain the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the order of the blocks when comparing them. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects in a sorted order, leading to a correct comparison and passing the failing test.
