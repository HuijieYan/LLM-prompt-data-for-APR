The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is done correctly between corresponding blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.

The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is utilized to sort the blocks for comparison. The sorting mechanism should include sorting by dtype name and `mgr_locs` values to ensure the correct comparison between blocks. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, sorting by dtype name and mgr_locs values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.start)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly for comparison. It uses both the dtype name and the `mgr_locs.start` value to determine the order, which should lead to accurate comparisons between corresponding blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.
