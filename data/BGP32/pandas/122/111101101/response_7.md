The bug in the `equals` function stems from incorrect comparison logic between the `self_axes` and `other_axes`. The function compares the axes directly, but it should compare the axis labels instead.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to check if the axis labels are equal.
2. Sort the blocks based on type names and manager locations for canonicalization.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the comparison issue with axes and properly sorts the blocks for comparison. It should now pass the failing test case.
