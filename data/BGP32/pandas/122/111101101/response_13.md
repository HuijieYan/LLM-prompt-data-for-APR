The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is due to the sorting mechanism of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. They are being sorted based on a tuple combining the type name and the manager locations of the blocks, but the manager locations are being converted to a list with `as_array.tolist()` which leads to an incorrect comparison of blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to change the `canonicalize` function to keep the manager locations as an array instead of converting it to a list using `as_array.tolist()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs  # Keep mgr_locs as it is without conversion

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided.
