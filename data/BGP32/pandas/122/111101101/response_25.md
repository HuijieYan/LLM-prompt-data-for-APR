The bug in the `equals` function is caused by sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, where the comparison of blocks is incorrect due to the use of `block.equals(oblock)`. The `block` and `oblock` variables are not defined correctly within the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `block` and `oblock` are retrieved from the correct positions within the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block values as well.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug and the failing test should now pass successfully.
