The bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the blocks. The function compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects but fails to handle the situation where the order of blocks may differ due to unconsolidated blocks such as Categorical data, which could affect the equality comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the ordering of blocks in addition to the data type. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the order of `mgr_locs` along with the data type in the tuple for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))  # Include mgr_locs order

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the comparison takes into account not only the data type of the block but also the order of `mgr_locs`, resolving the issue of unconsolidated blocks affecting equality checks.

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test provided.
