The bug in the `equals` function is caused by comparing blocks in an incorrect order, leading to a false negative result for the equality check. The bug arises due to the sorting logic applied to `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to define the sort key. However, this sorting method does not guarantee the correct order of comparison between the blocks.

To fix this bug, we should change the sorting logic and compare the blocks in the order they are stored in each `blocks` tuple. Instead of sorting the blocks, we can directly iterate over them and check for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version iterates over `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` directly, ensuring that the blocks are compared in the correct order without sorting based on a potentially unreliable key. This change should fix the bug identified in the failing test case provided.
