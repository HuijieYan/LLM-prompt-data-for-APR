The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to how blocks are being sorted and compared between `self` and `other`. The current implementation relies on the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on type name and manager locations before comparing them. However, the bug might be occurring due to the equality check not handling the case where blocks are not sorted in the same order.

To fix this issue, we can modify the sorting logic to compare blocks directly without relying on a custom sorting key. This way, the comparison will be more direct and should address the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks without relying on a custom sorting key, ensuring that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
