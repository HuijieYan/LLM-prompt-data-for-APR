### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. However, the comparison logic is flawed as it is comparing the blocks directly without considering their order or potential differences due to unconsolidated blocks.

The bug arises due to the direct comparison of blocks without considering their potential differences. The function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block dtype and manager locations. However, the comparison logic still directly compares the sorted blocks which can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly compare the blocks after sorting them based on dtype and manager locations. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we need to iterate over the sorted blocks and compare them one by one.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks using canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Iterate over sorted blocks and compare them
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By iterating over the sorted blocks and comparing them individually, we ensure a more accurate comparison between BlockManager instances and fix the bug in the `equals` function.
