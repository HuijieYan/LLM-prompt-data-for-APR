The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue seems to stem from the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should first check if the blocks have equal lengths before comparing them. Additionally, we should sort the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_len_blocks = len(self.blocks)
    other_len_blocks = len(other.blocks)
    
    if self_len_blocks != other_len_blocks:
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_string())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
