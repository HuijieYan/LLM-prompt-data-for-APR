The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison logic of the blocks. The blocks are compared based on their dtype name and the manager locations. However, the comparison of the dtype name is incorrect, leading to the equality check failing when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype name in a more appropriate way for comparison.
- Update the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to consider the dtype name correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype name, mgr_locs, and shape
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass as expected.
