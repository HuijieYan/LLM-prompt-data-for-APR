The bug in the provided `equals` function occurs due to incorrectly comparing blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal, then consolidates them and compares the blocks within. However, the comparison of blocks is flawed as it does not account for the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks from the two `BlockManager` instances are sorted in a canonical order before comparison. A canonical order should handle the dtype and location information of the blocks properly to ensure consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.mgr_locs), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This revised version ensures that the blocks are sorted properly before comparison based on a canonicalization key consisting of location and dtype information. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly.
