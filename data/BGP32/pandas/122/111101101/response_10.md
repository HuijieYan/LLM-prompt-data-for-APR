The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the sorting and comparison of blocks from the `BlockManager`. The function is currently sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function which sorts based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs` as arrays. However, the block comparison might not be accurate due to how the blocks are sorted.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly. One approach is to first sort the blocks based on their types and order, and then compare the sorted blocks. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the block order to ensure a proper comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on types and order
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x).__name__, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on types and order, and then comparing the sorted blocks, we ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function is done accurately. This should resolve the failing test case.
