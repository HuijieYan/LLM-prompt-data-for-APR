The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the comparison of blocks in an inconsistent order, as the blocks might be unconsolidated and not necessarily matching on direct comparison.

To fix the bug, we can sort the blocks based on a canonical representation that combines the type name and the manager locations. This way, even unconsolidated blocks can be distinguished based on the iteration order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in a consistent order, considering the type name and manager locations. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
