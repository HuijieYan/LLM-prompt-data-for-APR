The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`) for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The bug occurs because the block sorting logic in the `equals` function is not considering the dtype name and manager locations (`mgr_locs`) properly while comparing blocks. This causes the blocks to be compared incorrectly, leading to the function incorrectly determining the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to properly include both the dtype name and `mgr_locs` values in the tuple. This will ensure that blocks are sorted based on both factors.
2. Update the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to use the updated `canonicalize` function for sorting.
3. Comparing blocks should consider both the dtype and `mgr_locs` for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction should now properly compare the blocks based on both dtype name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring the correct equality comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.
