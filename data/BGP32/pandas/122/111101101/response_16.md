The bug in the function `equals` is related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when trying to compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which are sorted lists of blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize`. The bug occurs when attempting to call `equals` on the blocks, resulting in incorrect comparison logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately. We should compare the blocks directly rather than calling the `equals` method on them, as it seems that the `equals` method itself might be causing the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Import necessary dtype module
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import Dtype

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Other class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            if isinstance(block.dtype, Dtype):
                dtype_name = block.dtype.name
            else:
                dtype_name = block.dtype if block.dtype else None
            return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare blocks directly
        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version directly compares the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using `==` operator to ensure accurate comparison. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected during the failing test execution.
