### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing the `blocks` attribute of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue stems from the ordering of blocks in each `BlockManager` which may cause the comparison to fail incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are sorted based on a consistent key to facilitate correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager` instances should now be based on a consistent and deterministic ordering, resolving the bug.
