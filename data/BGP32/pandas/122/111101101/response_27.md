The bug in the provided function lies in how the blocks are sorted and checked for equality. The blocks are sorted by using a function `canonicalize` that combines the block's dtype name and manager locations to distinguish blocks. However, the bug arises from not handling the case when blocks have manager locations represented as arrays differently. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle blocks with manager locations represented as arrays correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block.mgr_locs, BlockPlacement):
            mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs.as_slice()
        else:
            mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the manager locations are correctly handled for equality comparison, resolving the bug that caused the failing test case.
