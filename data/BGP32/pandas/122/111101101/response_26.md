The bug in the `equals` function is due to the comparison of blocks in an incorrect order. The function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it should actually sort them based on the block's `item_mgr_locs` to ensure correct comparison of blocks. 

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use `item_mgr_locs` instead of `mgr_locs`. Then, sort the blocks based on this new comparison key.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using item_mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.items_mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects based on their item locations and pass the failing test.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
