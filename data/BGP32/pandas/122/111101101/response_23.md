The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison logic of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` attributes. The function fails to properly check whether the axes of both `self` and `other` BlockManagers are equal, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the axes of both BlockManagers are compared correctly. We should compare the axes of `self` with the axes of `other`, and only proceed with further comparison if the lengths and content of the axes are the same.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this correction, the `equals` function now properly compares the axes of different BlockManagers before proceeding with further comparison, ensuring that the function evaluates equality correctly. This will result in passing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
