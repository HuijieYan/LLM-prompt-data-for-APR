The bug in the `equals` method arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks is not handling the data correctly. The issue lies in the `as_array` function called on `block.mgr_locs`, which returns a numpy array. However, during comparison, the `as_array` attribute of `BlockPlacement` needs to be converted to a list to properly compare and sort the blocks. This discrepancy in data types causes the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to convert the numpy array to a list before comparing them. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` method should now handle the sorting and comparison of blocks correctly, fixing the failing test case.
