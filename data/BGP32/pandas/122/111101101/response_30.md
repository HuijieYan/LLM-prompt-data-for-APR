The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks from two `BlockManager` objects. The issue stems from the order of blocks being different between the two objects, leading to a false negative in the comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent order before comparison. We can achieve this by creating a canonical representation of the blocks based on the data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
