The bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting mechanism used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The current sorting mechanism is based on `canonicalize` function which generates a tuple combining the block's data type name and locations. This approach fails when the data types are not comparable for sorting, as seen in Case 1 where `dtype('int64')` cannot be compared to `dtype('object')`.

To address this issue, we can modify the sorting mechanism to first sort by data type and then by the index. This will ensure consistent sorting even when data types are not directly comparable.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks by dtype and then by the index
    def sort_key(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that blocks are sorted first by data type and then by index, which should resolve the sorting issue when comparing different data types.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
