The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, trying to check if the blocks are equal. However, the comparison of blocks with different manager locations can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include only the data type of the block, ensuring that blocks with the same data type are considered equal. This modification will prevent comparing blocks with different manager locations erroneously.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Canonicalize block order based on data type only
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function compares blocks based on their data type only, resolving the issue of incorrect comparison due to different manager locations.
