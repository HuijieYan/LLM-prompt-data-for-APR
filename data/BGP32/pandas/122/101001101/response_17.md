### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the provided function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not correctly defined. The current implementation of `canonicalize` returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and the list representation of `mgr_locs`, which is not a proper representation for comparison of two blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to redefine the `canonicalize` function to a representation that can accurately compare two blocks. One potential solution is to concatenate the data within the blocks into a single string and compare them. We could convert the blocks to a string using their respective `get_values` methods, then concatenate those strings for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the function with the revised `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by converting blocks to strings
    def canonicalize(block):
        return str(block.get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now accurately compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects by converting them to a string representation before sorting and comparing them.
