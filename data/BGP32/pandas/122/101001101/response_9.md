### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `Block` objects within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Before performing the comparison, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their types and `mgr_locs`. However, the way `mgr_locs` is accessed in the `canonicalize` function is incorrect, resulting in the bug.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is called. The correct way to access the `mgr_locs` attribute is `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# fixed version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `equals` function operates correctly by sorting the blocks based on their types and `mgr_locs`.
