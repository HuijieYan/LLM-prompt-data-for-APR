### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function occurs due to an incorrect comparison logic. The function compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations. However, it mistakenly uses `block.dtype.name` to identify the block type, which leads to wrong comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the identification of block types within the `canonicalize` function. Instead of relying on `block.dtype.name`, we should directly access the type of the block and include that in the sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to identify block types accurately using `type(block)` instead of `block.dtype.name`, the function will now compare blocks correctly and return the expected results.
