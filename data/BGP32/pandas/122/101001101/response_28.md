### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to distinguish blocks. However, the issue arises from accessing `block.dtype.name` directly as `block.dtype` is of type `dtype` which does not have an attribute `name`. 

To fix this issue, we need to extract the name from `block.dtype` correctly and update the `canonicalize` function accordingly.


### Bug Fix
We need to extract the name from `block.dtype` correctly and update the `canonicalize` function. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def extract_dtype_name(block):
            dtype_name = block.dtype.name if hasattr(block.dtype, 'name') else str(block.dtype)
            return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=extract_dtype_name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=extract_dtype_name)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Now, the function extracts the name correctly from `block.dtype` even if `name` attribute is missing, and utilizes it in the `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks based on type names and location lists.
