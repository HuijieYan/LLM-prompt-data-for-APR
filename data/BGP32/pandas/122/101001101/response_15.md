The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks but does not consider the actual content of the blocks. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing blocks with the same data but different orderings. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the data within the blocks for comparison. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the binary representation of the block values in addition to the `mgr_locs` for comparison. This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared based on the actual data within them.

This correction should address the issue of incorrect results when comparing blocks with similar content but different ordering.
