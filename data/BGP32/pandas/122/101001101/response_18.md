The bug in the provided function stems from the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not being called correctly. The `BlockPlacement` object does not have an attribute `as_array`, which leads to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `block.mgr_locs` object is correctly accessed. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle this case appropriately by checking if `mgr_locs` is an instance of `BlockPlacement`. If it is, we should directly use `mgr_locs` without attempting to call `as_array`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block.mgr_locs, BlockPlacement):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case of `mgr_locs` being a `BlockPlacement` object by directly using it without calling any additional methods. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to run correctly as expected in the failing test case provided.
