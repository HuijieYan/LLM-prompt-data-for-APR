The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is incorrectly implemented.

The `canonicalize` function should return a tuple containing the dtype name and the array representation of `mgr_locs`, but the bug is in the usage of `as_array.tolist()` which results in a list instead of a tuple. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly return a tuple. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of dtype name and array representation of `mgr_locs`, ensuring correct sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals` method.
