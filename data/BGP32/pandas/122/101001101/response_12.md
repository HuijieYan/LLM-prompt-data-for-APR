### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the provided code arises from the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager. The issue occurs due to the sorting of blocks based on a specific key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function incorrectly uses `block.dtype.name` to identify the block type, leading to sorting issues.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that block types are correctly identified for sorting. This modification will allow the comparison of blocks between different BlockManagers to be accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to correctly identify block types for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Identify block type by combining type name and slice
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected `canonicalize` function now uses `type(block).__name__` to correctly identify the block type for sorting. This modification ensures that blocks are compared accurately based on their types, resolving the sorting issue and fixing the bug.
