### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the given function arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks. The function is sorting the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and manager locations. However, the `canonicalize` function only includes the dtype name and the manager locations of the block, which is inadequate to distinguish between blocks across different axes. This results in incorrect sorting and ultimately leads to an incorrect comparison between blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function includes more information that can uniquely identify blocks across different axes. One solution could be to also include the index of the block in the tuple used for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(b, i) for i, b in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(b, i) for i, b in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function includes the index of the block in the sorting tuple within the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that blocks are uniquely identified across axes and correctly compared for equality.
