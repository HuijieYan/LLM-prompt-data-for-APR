### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function arises from not considering the dtype name and mgr_locs of the blocks in the comparison. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on dtype name only, but does not take into account the mgr_locs, potentially leading to incorrect results when comparing two BlockManager objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include both the dtype name and mgr_locs of the blocks, ensuring that the comparison considers both factors. This adjustment will make the comparison more accurate and reliable.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version of the function, we are now considering both the dtype name and mgr_locs in the block comparison, ensuring a more robust and accurate equality check between two BlockManager objects.
