The bug in the provided code lies in the sorting process of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The function `canonicalize` is attempting to access the `dtype` attribute directly on the block, which causes an AttributeError since `block` is actually an instance of `Block`. We need to access the dtype attribute of the `values` attribute of the block.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `dtype` attribute from the block's values. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

This change ensures that we are accessing the `dtype` attribute of the values within the block. With this correction, the code should now work correctly as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now handle the comparison of blocks correctly, resolving the bug.
