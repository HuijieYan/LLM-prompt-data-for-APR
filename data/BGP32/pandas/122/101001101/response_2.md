### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way blocks are being compared for equality. The function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, assuming that this sorting method will ensure equality between the blocks. However, it overlooks the fact that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might not have matching types or locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks directly for equality based on their data rather than relying on sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        pd._testing.assert_frame_equal(block._block, oblock._block)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the data (`_block`) within each block (`block` and `oblock`) for equality using `assert_frame_equal` function from pandas testing module.
