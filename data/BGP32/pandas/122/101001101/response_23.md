The issue in the provided buggy function is likely due to the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is intended to order the blocks based on both the data type and the manager locations. However, the `.tolist()` method should not be used directly on `mgr_locs.as_array`.

The `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call is converting the array to a list, potentially causing data comparisons to fail due to the change in structure from an array to a list.

To fix the bug, we should avoid converting `mgr_locs.as_array` to a list. Instead, we can directly use `mgr_locs.as_array` in the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the `.tolist()` call in the `canonicalize` function, we maintain the original structure of `mgr_locs.as_array` and should now correctly compare and order the blocks based on data type and manager locations.
