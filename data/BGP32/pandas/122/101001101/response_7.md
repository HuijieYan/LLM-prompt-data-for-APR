### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes, blocks, and a canonicalized order of the blocks. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function as the sorting criteria.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a tuple for each block with the dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` as the sorting key. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to a runtime error.
2. The `mgr_locs` attribute should be accessed as `block.mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to avoid the error.

### Bug Fix:
Access the `mgr_locs` attribute directly in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function correctly uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of blocks for sorting.
