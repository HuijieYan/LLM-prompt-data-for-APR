### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic is flawed in the sorting of blocks based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`. This leads to inconsistent block sorting, causing the `equals` function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare and sort the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is accurate and returns the correct result.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name dtype.name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
