The bug in the provided function is likely due to the comparison of blocks not yielding the expected result. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`, which might not properly reflect the equality between blocks.

To fix this bug, a more reliable comparison approach could be used. One such approach could be to check if the blocks are identical, rather than relying on sorting and comparing based on type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if self.blocks.keys() != other.blocks.keys() or any(
        not np.array_equal(self.blocks[key], other.blocks[key]) 
        for key in self.blocks
    ):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version now directly compares the blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. It checks if the keys of the blocks are the same and if the corresponding blocks are equal using `np.array_equal` for NumPy arrays. This approach ensures a more reliable comparison and should address the bug in the original function.
