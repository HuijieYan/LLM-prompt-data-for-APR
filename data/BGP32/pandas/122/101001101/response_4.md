### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function attempts to compare blocks between two instances of `BlockManager` by sorting them based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the comparison logic is flawed, which leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic for the blocks. Instead of comparing based on block type and locations, we should compare the blocks directly. This can be done by iterating over blocks in both instances of `BlockManager` and checking for equality between corresponding blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False

        return True
```

With this correction, the function iterates over the blocks in both instances of `BlockManager` and compares them directly using the `equals` method of the blocks. This approach ensures a correct comparison and fixes the buggy behavior.
