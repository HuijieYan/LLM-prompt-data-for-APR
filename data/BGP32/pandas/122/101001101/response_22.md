The bug in the provided function stems from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function wrongly uses `mgr_locs` as `as_array` and then tries to convert it to a list, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use the `as_array` method directly without the `tolist()` call. This will correctly compare the block locations for sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should work correctly as intended and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
