The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks in different orders without considering their content. This leads to false negatives in cases where the blocks are identical but ordered differently. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparisons are done based on the actual content of the blocks rather than just their order. One way to achieve this is by comparing the blocks based on their content, regardless of their order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing functions remain unchanged
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block)

        self_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks}
        other_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks}

        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we compare the blocks using a set comparison based on their content and data type. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately and does not rely on the order of the blocks.
