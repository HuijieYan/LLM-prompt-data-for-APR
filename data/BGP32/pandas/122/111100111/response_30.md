### Identification of Potential Errors
1. The buggy function `equals` compares `self.blocks` with `other.blocks`, but there is no direct documentation or initialization of `blocks` in the `BlockManager` class. This could potentially lead to errors.
2. The `canonicalize` function seems to be using the `block.dtype.name` attribute, which may not be initialized properly.
3. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the custom `canonicalize` function needs to be checked for correctness.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic when using the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when comparing two DataFrames `df3` and `df4`, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares the blocks of data within the `BlockManager` instances. The implementation uses a custom `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the data types and locations, but due to potential issues with the initialization of `blocks`, `mgr_locs`, or the comparison logic within `canonicalize`, the function fails to correctly identify the differences between the two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `blocks` attribute is correctly initialized and populated within the `BlockManager` objects.
2. Validate the structure and content of the `blocks` attribute to confirm that it contains the expected data blocks.
3. Check the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that it accurately captures the necessary information for identifying block differences.
4. Debug the comparison logic between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to address any issues with sorting and equality checks.

### Corrected Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are directly used for comparison, assuming that the `blocks` attribute is correctly initialized in the `BlockManager` instances.
- The `canonicalize` function now converts the `block.dtype` to a string for comparison and uses the `block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes()` to identify block locations for sorting.
- The equality check between the blocks is maintained to compare the sorted block lists for equality.

This corrected version addresses the potential issues with the comparison logic and should resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
