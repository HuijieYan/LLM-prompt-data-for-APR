### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes and blocks. It then sorts the blocks based on a `canonicalize` function and checks if each block equals the corresponding block in the other instance.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` in cases where the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function does not handle the case where blocks may have different locations but are actually equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle blocks with different locations but identical content. We should compare the content of the blocks directly instead of relying on the block locations for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# this is the corrected in the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.is_
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.is_
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The correction involves calling a method `is_block_equal` (that should be implemented) on the `Block` objects to check if their content matches irrespective of their memory locations. This change ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
