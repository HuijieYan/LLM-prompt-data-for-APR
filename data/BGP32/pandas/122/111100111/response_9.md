### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The bug seems to be related to the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks in the `equals` function.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the expected output for a particular test case is `False`, but the function wrongly returns `True`.
5. The bug is likely in the block sorting logic that does not consider differences in block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting mechanism used in comparing blocks considers block locations to provide correct equality comparison. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations when sorting blocks.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining type name and mgr_locs to consider locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting order, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.
