### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances first, then consolidates both instances, and finally compares the blocks within them.
3. The bug arises because after consolidating the blocks of both instances, the function compares them without considering the order of the blocks.
4. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function is most likely due to the way blocks are compared after consolidation. Since the blocks are sorted without considering their actual locations, identical blocks with different locations might be incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are compared based on their content and location. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the location information along with the dtype name when sorting the blocks. This change will help in correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. This fix should address the bug reported on the GitHub issue.
