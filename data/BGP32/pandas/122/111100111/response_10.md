### Identified Bug:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which relies on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to determine the order. The bug occurs when two identical blocks with different locations are compared, leading to a false positive similarity result.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the block's data type name and the block's locations.
2. In scenarios where two blocks have the same data but different locations, they end up being sorted as different blocks, leading to `equals` incorrectly returning `True`.
3. This behavior results in the `equals` function wrongly returning `True` for dataframes that should be considered not equal due to differing block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and ensure correct behavior for comparing dataframes, we can redefine the way blocks are compared inside the `equals` function. Instead of relying on the block's locations, we can focus on comparing the actual data within each block to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the data in each block to determine equality
    return all(
        block.values_equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the updated version, a new method `values_equals` is introduced to compare the actual values in the blocks for equality. This way, the comparison is based on the data content rather than the block locations to provide correct equality evaluation for dataframes.
