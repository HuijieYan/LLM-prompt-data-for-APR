### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` which have columns swapped between integer and string types.
3. The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return `False` when comparing these two DataFrames due to the mismatch in data types.
4. The bug arises from incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function where it fails to consider the data type differences in the blocks.
5. The GitHub issue confirms the bug where the expected output is `False` but the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison logic to include checking for data type consistency in the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the data types of corresponding blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects before declaring them as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if blocks have equal data types before comparing
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks) or any(block.dtype != oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, after sorting the blocks by data type and locations, we added a check to verify if the data types of corresponding blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal.
- If any data type mismatch is detected, the function immediately returns `False`.
- This correction ensures that the comparison considers both block content and data types, fixing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output value of `False` for the given DataFrames.
