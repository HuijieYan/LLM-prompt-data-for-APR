### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the axes of the two objects, consolidates them, compares the number of blocks each object has, and then compares each block of the two objects.
   
2. The bug occurs when comparing blocks of `self` and `other` objects. The comparison logic uses `sorted()` with a custom key function `canonicalize()` that generates a tuple combining the dtype name and `mgr_locs` (locations of the block). However, `mgr_locs` is expected to be accessed as an attribute of each block rather than using `.as_array.tolist()` method.

3. The comparison of blocks in the buggy function is incorrect and fails to identify equal blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function. The usage of `.as_array.tolist()` on `mgr_locs` is incorrect as it results in comparing blocks that might appear different due to their locations only.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, remove the `.as_array.tolist()` method when generating the canonicalized form of blocks for comparison. Instead, directly use the `block.mgr_locs` attribute.
- With this change, the comparison logic will correctly identify equal blocks even if they are at different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class should now correctly compare blocks and return the expected results, passing the failing test case provided.
