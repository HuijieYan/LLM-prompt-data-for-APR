The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks within two instances. The function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing blocks that have identical data but different locations. To fix this bug, we need to consider the block locations during the comparison.

The `canonicalize` function is introduced to create a tuple that combines the block type name and block locations to distinguish between blocks. By sorting the blocks using this mechanism, we can compare them accurately based on both type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version considers the block locations by converting the `mgr_locs` to tuples in the `canonicalize` function to ensure accurate comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return `False` as expected in the failing test case provided. It addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to the incorrect behavior of the function when handling blocks with different locations.
