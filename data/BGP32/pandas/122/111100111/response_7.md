### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The buggy function is a part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. It is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
   
2. The function fetches axes from both `self` and `other` objects and compares their lengths. Then it iterates over the axes to check for equality. It performs inplace consolidation on `self` and `other` objects and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it tries to canonicalize the block order and compares corresponding blocks for equality.

3. The bug causing the wrong return value lies in the canonicalization procedure where the code attempts to convert `mgr_locs` of each block to a list by calling `as_array.tolist()`. This method call is incorrect and should be replaced with `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

4. To fix this bug, the mentioned correction needs to be applied to ensure the correct comparison of block locations.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version fixes the bug by correctly retrieving the list of block locations within the canonicalize function.

By applying this correction, the function should now be able to correctly compare `BlockManager` objects for equality and pass the failing test case provided.
