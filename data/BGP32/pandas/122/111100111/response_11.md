## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises when comparing the blocks because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not handle unconsolidated blocks properly.
2. The bug occurs when there are unconsolidated blocks in the `self` and `other` instances, leading to incorrect comparisons and `equals()` method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

## Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function fails to correctly handle unconsolidated blocks within `self` and `other` instances.
- During the execution of the `equals()` method, if unconsolidated blocks are present in the `self` and `other` instances, the comparison logic based on the sorted blocks can lead to incorrect outcomes.
- As a result, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` fails because it expects the `equals()` method to return `False` for two DataFrames with different values, but due to unconsolidated blocks, it incorrectly returns `True`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals(self, other)` function, we need to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled correctly during block comparison. One way to address this is to consolidate the blocks before comparing them to ensure consistent comparisons across different instances.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks before comparison
    if any(not block.consolidated for block in self.blocks):
        self._consolidate_blocks()
    if any(not block.consolidated for block in other.blocks):
        other._consolidate_blocks()

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to consolidate the blocks if they are unconsolidated before comparison. This ensures that the comparison logic in the `equals()` function is consistent and handles unconsolidated blocks correctly.
