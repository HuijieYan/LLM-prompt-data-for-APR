### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and then proceeding to compare the blocks' equality in a specified order.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different values in corresponding columns and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`.
- The expected behavior is for the comparison to return `False` due to the mismatch in the DataFrames' values.

### Error:
The bug lies in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. While it correctly checks the axes and performs block comparisons, the issue arises from the sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize`. 
The `canonicalize` function is extracting the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, attempting to distinguish blocks by these properties. If `mgr_locs` are different, it will not reflect actual block differences.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Consider changing the block comparison logic to a more straightforward approach that directly compares block values.
2. If retaining block sorting is essential for performance reasons, modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only necessary properties for distinguishing blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version compares the axes directly and then ensures that the blocks are consolidated before comparison. It then directly compares the blocks without sorting based on `canonicalize`. This should resolve the issue and return the expected `False` in the failing test.
