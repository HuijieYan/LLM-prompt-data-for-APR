The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The buggy function compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The bug arises when the function fails to correctly compare block locations when blocks have identical content but are located differently.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the faulty comparison of the block locations in the `equals` function. In the case provided by the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have identical content but are arranged differently. The current implementation of the `equals` function does not consider the block locations, leading to a false positive comparison and returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider both block content and block locations. By sorting the blocks based on content and locations before comparison, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering both content and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both content and locations as shown in the corrected version above, the `equals` function should now correctly identify the case where blocks have identical content but are located differently as unequal. This correction should address the bug described in the GitHub issue as well.
