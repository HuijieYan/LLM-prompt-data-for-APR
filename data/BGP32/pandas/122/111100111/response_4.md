### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:
- The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The issue reported in GitHub mentions that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.
- The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances first and then compares the blocks for equality.
- The issue arises due to identical block content but different locations within the blocks.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes using `all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))`.
2. Sorting blocks based on dtype name and locations which may not correctly handle identical blocks with different locations.

### Explanation of the bug:
- The buggy function fails to handle identical blocks with different locations. This leads to incorrect results while comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
- The function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are compared for equality. Instead of sorting blocks based on dtype name and locations, we should compare the content of each block directly to ensure correct equality comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import necessary dependencies
import numpy as np

# Updated equals function to fix the bug
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By directly comparing the values of blocks using `np.array_equal`, we can ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, taking into account identical content even with different locations.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case provided.
