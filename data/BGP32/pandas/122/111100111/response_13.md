### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
2. The bug is identified in the comparison of blocks due to a discrepancy in the way blocks are sorted and their equality is checked.
3. The bug causes the function to wrongly return `True` in cases where blocks have identical data but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that block comparison considers the actual data rather than just the block object itself.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize()` function to extract the actual data from the block while sorting.
2. Compare the actual data of the blocks instead of comparing the block objects directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Result:
The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
