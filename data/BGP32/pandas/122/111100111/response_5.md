## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block ordering.
2. The buggy function first compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks of both instances.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals()` function is returning True incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug could be due to the comparison of blocks without considering the possibility of blocks having different locations.

## Bug:
The bug in the `equals()` function arises when comparing blocks based solely on their content, without considering their locations. This leads to incorrect True returns when comparing identical blocks located differently.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals()` function to consider both content equality and block locations.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on content and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    # Sort blocks by canonicalization
    self_located_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_located_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all corresponding located blocks are equal
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_located_blocks, other_located_blocks))
```

By considering the block values as bytes and their locations, the corrected function ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly detected as unequal.
