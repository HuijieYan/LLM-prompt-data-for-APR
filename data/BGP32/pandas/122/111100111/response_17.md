### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes and consolidates the blocks before comparing them.
3. The bug arises when comparing blocks due to the inconsistent order of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects.
4. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects are canonicalized before comparing. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`. This will guarantee a consistent order for block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the `BlockManager` objects based on the canonicalized block order, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.
