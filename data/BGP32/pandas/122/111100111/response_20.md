### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on various attributes like axes, blocks, and block types.
2. The bug arises due to a faulty comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The comparison does not consider the order of blocks and hence results in incorrect equality checks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` in different orders. The expected output is `False`, but the current implementation of `equals` returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the order of blocks when comparing them.
2. Ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are done based on a consistent criteria to prevent false equality results.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, sorting based on a unique key for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a consistent sorting key for each block in the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that blocks are sorted before comparison, the `equals` function will now properly handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently, as in the failing test case.
