### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. However, there is a bug where it might incorrectly return True for cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Error location
The main error in the function is in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison.

### Cause of the bug
1. When comparing the blocks, the function tries to canonicalize them based on the block's datatype name and the locations of the block. This approach does not consider the actual content of the block.
2. This can lead to situations where two blocks with the same content but different locations are considered different.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the block rather than just the datatype name and locations.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Revised canonicalization function to consider block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().data.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's content (`block.get_values().data.tobytes()`) along with the datatype name for sorting. This modification ensures that two blocks with the same content but different locations will be correctly identified as equal.
