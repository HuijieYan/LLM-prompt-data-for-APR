### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises when the function incorrectly identifies different blocks with the same content but different locations as equal.
3. The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect results. The failing test case provided showcases this issue by comparing two DataFrames with the same data but in different orders which should return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to consider block locations as part of the comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `block.mgr_locs` into the `canonicalize` function and converting to a tuple for comparison, we ensure that the comparison considers the block locations as well.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case provided in the question.
