### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The buggy function compares the axes, consolidates both objects in place, checks the number of blocks they contain, and then sorts and compares the blocks.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights that the `equals` function returns `True` even when the locations of identical blocks are different, which is incorrect.
4. The buggy function fails to consider the differences in block locations when comparing blocks for equality, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider block locations while checking for equality. We should compare the blocks based on their data content as well as their locations to ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By including `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)` in the `all` comparison statement, we incorporate the check for the block locations as well. This correction ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not result in equality.
