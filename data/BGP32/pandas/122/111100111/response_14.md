### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks and their locations.
2. The function extracts `axes` from both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances for comparison. Then, it consolidates both instances in place before comparing their blocks.
3. The bug seems to arise from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function due to different block locations. The sorting of blocks based on a canonical representation may not handle unconsolidated blocks properly.
4. A potential fix would involve ensuring that the comparison of blocks does not rely on potentially different locations. Instead, a more direct comparison based on the block content may be needed.

### Correction
Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function to address the bug and pass the failing test:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare the blocks without sorting by canonical representation
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`, this correction aims to address the issue related to different block locations causing incorrectly reported equality.
