The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly determining equality between two instances by ordering the blocks based on type name and manager locations without considering the actual content. This leads to a situation where identical blocks with different locations are considered unequal. Therefore, the function mistakenly returns `False` when comparing dataframes that have identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual contents of the blocks instead of ordering them by type and locations. We can achieve this by comparing the block values directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Check equality for each block
    for index, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[index]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function compares the blocks directly without sorting them based on type names and manager locations. It iterates over the blocks and checks for equality based on the `equals` method of each block. By doing this, we ensure that the function correctly determines the equality of two instances regardless of the specific block locations. 

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case provided.
