### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is called `equals` and is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two objects and proceeds to compare their blocks based on a canonical ordering.
3. The bug seems to be related to the ordering of blocks and their comparison.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different data types. It then checks if the `equals` function returns `False`, which is the expected behavior.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the function wrongly returns `True` in some cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.

### Error Cause:
- The bug in the function arises from the way it compares the blocks. If the blocks have the same data but differ in their locations within the object, the current implementation may wrongly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we should modify the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just the location within the object.
- We can achieve this by comparing the actual data content of the blocks instead of their locations within the object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then **the actual data** of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will compare the actual data content of the blocks when determining equality and should now return the expected result for the failing test case.
