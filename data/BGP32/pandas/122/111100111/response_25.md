### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is checking if two instances of the class are equal by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, comparing the number of blocks they contain, and then comparing each block individually after sorting them.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly compare the blocks due to inconsistency in the order and location of the blocks in different instances.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns swapped, expecting them to be not equal. The actual behavior with the buggy `equals` function is returning True, indicating they are considered equal based on the implementation of sorting and comparing blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, considering their dtype and mgr_locs.
5. We need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. We would then sort the blocks using this updated comparison and compare the sorted blocks in the return statement.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts(), block.mgr_locs.to_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The updated `equals` function correctly compares the blocks by sorting them based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`. This fix ensures that the blocks are compared consistently and accurately, resolving the issue of incorrectly marking different instances as equal.
