### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug arises from the comparison of the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance. The comparison of blocks is not taking into consideration the block locations, leading to incorrect results.

The expected behavior is that the function should return `False` if the two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. It then consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
3. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in each `BlockManager`.
4. It then proceeds to sort the blocks based on a canonicalized form, which is a tuple combining the block data type name and manager locations.
5. Finally, it compares each block from one `BlockManager` with the corresponding block from the other `BlockManager`.

The bug occurs because sorting the blocks based on the canonicalized form does not consider the block's actual location, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks must consider both the block's data and its location. A strategy to fix this bug would involve modifying the `canonicalize` function to incorporate block locations in the sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[1]))  # Sort by data type and location
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[1]))  # Sort by data type and location

    return all(
        block[1].equals(oblock[1]) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block location information when sorting the blocks in both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This change ensures that the comparison considers both the block's data type and location.
