### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManagers`, consolidates them internally, compares the number of blocks they contain, sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized key, and then checks if each block is equal.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, violating the expected behavior provided in the failing test.
4. The issue in GitHub highlights this bug, indicating that the `equals()` method should return `False` in such cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers not only the content but also the actual locations of the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the block comparison to include the block location in addition to the content.
2. Sort the blocks based on a tuple of content and location to ensure correct comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic to properly handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.get_values().equals(oblock.get_values()) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function now compares both the content and the locations of the blocks while sorting them.
2. The comparison now includes both the block values and the block locations to ensure correct behavior.
3. By checking both values and locations, the function correctly identifies the equivalence of blocks without being affected by their positions.
