### Analysis:
1. The buggy function attempts to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing each block within the BlockManager objects.
2. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks. The `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call should be replaced with `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to avoid a potential AttributeError.
3. The bug results in the `equals` function returning incorrectly due to a misordering of block locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that block locations are correctly compared by using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` without the extraneous type conversion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
