### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. The buggy function `equals` is implemented in the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` by first comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, comparing the number of blocks, and then comparing the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs.

2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types in reverse order and then checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns False.

3. The expected case involves checking the input parameters, expected values, and types during test execution. It expects the axes, blocks, and internal variables to be correctly structured for comparison.

4. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True when the expected output should be False. This issue is due to identical blocks with different locations being wrongly evaluated as equal.

### Fixing the bug:

To address the bug described in the GitHub issue and to satisfy the expected case requirements, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used in the `equals` function. We should consider sorting blocks by dtype name and locations to handle unconsolidated blocks properly.

#### Corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by dtype and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks in the `equals` function based on dtype name and locations to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled during comparison.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now return the expected output of False for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
