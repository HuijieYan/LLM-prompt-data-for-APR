To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to address the issue where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal. This is causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The buggy function is currently sorting the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to check for equality. However, this approach fails to handle cases where identical blocks are in different locations.

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the sorting logic to consider the blocks' contents rather than their locations. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their actual values rather than their locations. This change ensures that identical blocks in different locations will be correctly identified as equal, fixing the issue raised in the GitHub report.

After updating the `equals` function with the corrected logic, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass without any issues.
