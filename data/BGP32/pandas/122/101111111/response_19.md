The buggy function `equals` is not behaving correctly because it is comparing two dataframes for equality, but the comparison is currently returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function takes two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`, compares the lengths of their axes, and then checks individual axes for equality using `ax1.equals(ax2)`. If the lengths or any axis does not match, it returns `False` correctly.
2. The problematic part is when it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. It sorts the blocks based on block type and locations, then checks if each block is equal.
3. The issue arises because the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` are switched in the ordering due to sorting, causing a false equality check. This is the reason why the test is failing and returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks considers the correct order of block types with respect to their locations. One way to achieve this is by modifying the key function used in the `sorted` method to include a unique identifier for each block.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the class name of the block along with the dtype and locations in the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function, we ensure a unique ordering for the blocks.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and return the expected output of `False` when comparing the two dataframes.
