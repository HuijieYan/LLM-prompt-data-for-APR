## Correction:

The issue in the buggy function arises because the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, potentially leading to a false positive when checking for block equality. To resolve this issue, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the dtype name, manager locations, and block data when sorting the blocks. This way, the comparison between blocks will be more robust and accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including dtype, mgr_locs, and data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly compare blocks based on their dtype name, manager locations, and data, ensuring a more accurate equality check.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
