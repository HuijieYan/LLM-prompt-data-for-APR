The bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly compares the two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic doesn't consider the actual content of the blocks but instead checks the order and the metadata associated with them.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the `equals` function to compare the content of the blocks rather than the order and metadata. We can achieve this by comparing the content of each block using the `equals` method of each block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This revised version correctly compares the content of each block by calling the `equals` method for each block in the two `BlockManager` objects.

The revised function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` by correctly comparing the content of the blocks in the two `DataFrame` objects.
