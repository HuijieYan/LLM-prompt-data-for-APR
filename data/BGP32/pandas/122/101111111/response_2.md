### Fixing the Bug

#### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison logic within the function. The function is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances without taking into consideration the different locations of identical blocks, leading to a False result in the failing test. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but it does not consider the actual content of the blocks.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks while comparing them. We should compare the values within the blocks to determine equality rather than relying solely on the order of blocks based on their dtype and locations.

#### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

#### Testing the Corrected Function:
After applying the fix and running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()`, the corrected function should now return False, satisfying the expected behavior.

By making the comparison based on the actual content of the blocks, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
