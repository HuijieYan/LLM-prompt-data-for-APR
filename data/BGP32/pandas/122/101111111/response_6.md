Based on the information provided, the issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`, leading to a failing test.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The blocks are being sorted based on a comparison key created using `canonicalize(block)` function. However, the `canonicalize` function is not handling the `block.mgr_locs` attribute correctly, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. The comparison key should include all attributes that uniquely identify a block.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the necessary block attributes for comparison, the `equals` function will be able to correctly identify and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
