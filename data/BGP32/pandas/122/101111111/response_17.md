The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by incorrect comparison of blocks. The bug results in two identical blocks with different locations being evaluated as equal, leading to a wrong return value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function takes into account not just the content but also the locations of the blocks. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to incorporate both the type name and the locations of the blocks for a more accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice() for b in block.blocks))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version now takes into account the locations of the blocks using `mgr_locs.as_slice()` function within the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are not wrongly evaluated as equal.

By implementing this fix, the failing test provided should now pass as the comparison is done accurately based on both content and locations of the blocks.
