Based on the provided information, the issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is incorrectly returning `False` in some scenarios where it should return `True`, leading to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is comparing blocks based on the order of their locations, which can result in false negatives when the blocks themselves are identical but located differently.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we removed the sorting of blocks based on locations before comparison. Instead, we directly compare the blocks in their original order, ensuring that identical blocks will be correctly recognized.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and provide the expected output.
