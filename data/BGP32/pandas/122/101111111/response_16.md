Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function arises because it does not consider the block locations of identical blocks. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with blocks that have different locations. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to include block locations in the comparison of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added the consideration of block locations through `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function. Sorting the blocks by this canonical representation ensures that blocks with different locations are not considered equal. This modification addresses the bug and enables the function to correctly compare DataFrames.

By implementing this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as the `equals` function will correctly handle comparisons between DataFrames with blocks having different locations.
