## Correction:

The issue in the `equals` method arises due to the comparison of blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect equality evaluation. To resolve this issue, we need to update the comparison logic to consider the block content rather than the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, using a tuple combining the block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction in place, the comparison will now correctly evaluate the equality of blocks based on their values rather than their locations. This change ensures that the `equals` method accurately compares DataFrames and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
