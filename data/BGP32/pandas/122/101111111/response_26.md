The bug is in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with different blocks but identical data values. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `equals` function checks for the equality of axes and the equality of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects.
2. If the axes are not of the same length, the function correctly returns `False`.
3. However, when iterating through and comparing the blocks, it lacks a proper check for the data values in the blocks themselves.
4. Due to this missing check, if the blocks contain identical data but are located at different positions, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
5. This behavior contradicts the expected output of the test case provided, leading to the failing test.

### Solution Strategy
1. Introduce a comparison of the data values within the blocks to ensure that even if the blocks are consolidated differently, the actual content is checked for equality.
2. Update the `equals` function to include a comparison of the data values within the blocks in addition to the existing comparisons for axes and block lengths.
3. While sorting the blocks based on their characteristics, ensure that the actual data values are considered for equality checks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding a comparison of the values within the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function will handle the scenario where identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal, addressing the bug and passing the failing test case.
