## Correction:

The issue in the `equals` function arises because the comparison of blocks in different order can lead to `True` being falsely returned when comparing DataFrames. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the blocks in both `self` and `other` are sorted consistently before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Other functions remain unchanged
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Helper function to sort blocks by dtype.name and mgr_locs
        def sort_blocks(blocks):
            return sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
        self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks in `self` and `other` are consistently sorted before comparison, which resolves the issue of false `True` being returned when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the GitHub issue.
