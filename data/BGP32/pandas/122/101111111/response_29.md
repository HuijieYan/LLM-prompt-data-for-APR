The bug in the `equals` function is causing the DataFrame comparison to return an incorrect result. The bug stems from sorting the blocks based on the block type and the locations of the blocks. Since the location of the blocks is determined by the `mgr_locs` attribute, two identical blocks with different locations mistakenly result in a `True` comparison. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the order of blocks solely based on the block type. This way, blocks with the same type but different locations won't impact the comparison result.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block type only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by properly comparing DataFrame blocks based on their types only, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations do not affect the comparison result.
