## Correction

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function, used for ordering blocks, does not handle the case where the location of the blocks differs due to the `mgr_locs` attribute. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the manager locations (`mgr_locs`). 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering dtype and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this change, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. It ensures that the order of blocks is considered based on dtype and manager locations.
