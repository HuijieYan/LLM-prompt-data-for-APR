## Corrected Version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Create a sorted list of blocks for comparison
        canonicalize = lambda blocks: sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        self_blocks_sorted = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks_sorted = canonicalize(other.blocks)
        
        if len(self_blocks_sorted) != len(other_blocks_sorted):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
        )
    
```

By making sure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in the same manner before comparison, the corrected function addresses the issue of identifying identical blocks with different locations erroneously. This change ensures that the block comparison between the two BlockManagers maintains consistency and correctly returns the expected result.
