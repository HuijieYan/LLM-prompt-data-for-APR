### Analysis:
The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check for equality between two instances by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the buggy function fails to return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations due to the `canonicalize` function's sorting based on `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the sorting performed in the `canonicalize` function, which considers both the type name and `block.mgr_locs`. This causes DataFrames with the same block content but different locations to be considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the type name for sorting the blocks. This change will ensure that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Fix the canonicalize function to consider only the type name for sorting
def canonicalize(block):
    return block.dtype.name

# Update the buggy equals function to correct the comparison
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on type name only
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` function will properly handle cases where DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations and return the expected result.
