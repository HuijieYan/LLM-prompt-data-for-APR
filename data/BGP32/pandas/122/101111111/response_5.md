## Corrections

### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue occurs due to the comparison of blocks that have the same content but different locations.

### Correction Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to handle cases where blocks have the same content but different locations. We can achieve this by comparing the content of blocks rather than comparing the blocks themselves.

### Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Get the values of blocks for comparison
    self_block_values = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_block_values == other_block_values
```

In this corrected version, we extract the values of blocks using the `get_values()` method and compare these values to determine equality.

This correction addresses the issue identified in the test function and aligns with the expected input/output values.

By implementing this fix, the failing test should pass as expected.
