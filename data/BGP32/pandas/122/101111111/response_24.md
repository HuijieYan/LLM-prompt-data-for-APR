## Corrections and Explanations

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from comparing columns of two DataFrames based on their order rather than their values. The bug results from the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks. Sorting blocks by dtype name and manager locations can lead to incorrect comparisons, especially when the manager locations are different but the actual values within the blocks are the same.

To fix this bug, the sorting logic for blocks needs to be adjusted to compare blocks based on their actual content rather than their dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrections
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Expected Results
With the corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, as it explicitly checks for inequality between two DataFrames with different column order.

The corrected function now properly compares blocks based on their content rather than their order. This adjustment ensures that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with the same contents but different block locations.

After implementing this correction, the expected output of the failing test should now align with the expected output mentioned in the GitHub issue.
