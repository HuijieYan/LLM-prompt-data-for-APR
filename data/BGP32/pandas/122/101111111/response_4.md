## Correction:

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the comparison of blocks with different locations. The issue arises due to the comparison based on the original order of blocks and not considering the actual content of the blocks. Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    # Compare the axes of both BlockManagers
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both BlockManagers before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks to address different block locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    
    # Compare each block in the sorted order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version above, I've ensured that the blocks are sorted based on their content through the `repr` function. This modification guarantees that the comparison between blocks considers their actual content rather than just their locations. With this change, the `equals` function should now return the expected result and pass the failing test.
