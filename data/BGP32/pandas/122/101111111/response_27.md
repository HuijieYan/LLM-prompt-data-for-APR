To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks. Currently, the function attempts to sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, potentially leading to sorting mismatches.

To address the issue, we need to compare the blocks directly for equality instead of relying on sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, the corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test.

This correction ensures that the blocks are compared for equality without sorting, reflecting the true comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.
