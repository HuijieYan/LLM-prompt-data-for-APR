The bug in the provided function `equals` is due to the wrong comparison when sorting the blocks based on their types and locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it relies on the `mgr_locs.as_array` attribute, which should be accessed as `mgr_locs.as_array()`. This discrepancy causes the function to fail in sorting blocks correctly and leads to the wrong comparison of DataFrame equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function for sorting the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `mgr_locs.as_array()` instead of `mgr_locs.as_array`, the function will now correctly sort the blocks based on their type and locations, ensuring the DataFrame comparison is accurate.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test provided.
