The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue is related to the sorting logic of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, where the order is determined by the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to incorrect sorting if the blocks have different locations but contain the same data.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on their content rather than their location. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their data content, for example using the `to_numpy().tolist()` method instead of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on data content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.to_numpy().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their data content and not their location, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
