The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is due to an incorrect comparison logic that does not account for the possibility of identical blocks being in different locations. This results in the method mistakenly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To address this issue, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider the actual equality of blocks rather than their order. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks themselves regardless of their positions within the manager.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Updated comparison to check equality of blocks directly
    return all(
        sblock.equals(oblock) for sblock, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists directly, we ensure that the `equals` method correctly identifies the equivalence of the two `BlockManager` instances. This change should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.

The corrected function now properly handles the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
