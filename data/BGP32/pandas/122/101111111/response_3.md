The bug in the `equals` function lies in how the blocks are sorted based on their dtype and mgr_locs (locations). The issue arises when comparing blocks that are identical but are positioned differently, leading to a false positive equality check.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations in the sorting criteria. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes().hex())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `mgr_locs` in the sorting criteria as a hexadecimal representation, we ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly distinguished. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
