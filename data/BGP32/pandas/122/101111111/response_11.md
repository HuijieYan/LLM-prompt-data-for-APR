### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The problem arises from the comparison of the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes.

The `equals` function first checks if the number of `self_axes` is equal to the number of `other_axes`. If it is not, it returns `False`, which is correct. However, after consolidating the blocks in place for both `self` and `other` instances, it compares the blocks. The bug lies in the sorting mechanism based on `canonicalize` function, which does not consider the actual values of the blocks but only their data types and locations.

Due to this sorting mechanism, the blocks may be considered equal even if their values are different but their locations are the same, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to consider the actual values of the blocks while sorting them. This will ensure that only blocks with the same values and locations are considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering values as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the values of the blocks while sorting them, this corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and avoid false positives in block comparison.
