Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is related to the comparison of blocks in two DataFrames, which results in an incorrect assertion failure in the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Analysis:
The buggy function incorrectly determines equality by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. This leads to a false positive when comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we should consider the actual content of the blocks instead of their sorting order based on dtype and manager locations. By comparing the content of blocks directly, we can ensure the correct evaluation of DataFrame equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the suggested modification, the corrected `equals()` function now compares the blocks directly without relying on sorting based on dtype and manager locations.

### Expected Outcome:
After applying the correction, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expected to pass successfully, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
