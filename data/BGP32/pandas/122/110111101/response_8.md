The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the way blocks are sorted and compared between two `BlockManager` instances. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but this might not be the most appropriate way to compare blocks for equality.

To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on specific attributes that might not capture the equality accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in the same position in the two `BlockManager` instances for equality. This ensures that the equality comparison is accurate and does not rely on potentially misrepresentative sorting criteria.

With this corrected version, the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any issues.
