### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes, blocks, and corresponding data blocks are equal. The bug arises due to the comparison logic within the function. When comparing blocks, it attempts to sort them based on data type and location, using the `canonicalize` helper function. However, the `canonicalize` function incorrectly converts the `mgr_locs` attribute to a list which results in incorrect block sorting and subsequent equality checks, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute without converting it to a list. This change will ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on data type and location, leading to accurate equality checks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the
    # iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the stated modifications to the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
