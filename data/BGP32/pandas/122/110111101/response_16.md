The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is due to the comparison of blocks between two instances (`self` and `other`) where the comparison does not handle the scenario where the blocks can be in different order due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. Instead of converting `mgr_locs` to a list, we should compare the values themselves directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction will properly identify the blocks even when they are in different order and resolve the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided.
