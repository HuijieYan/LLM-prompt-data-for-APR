### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises because the equality comparison logic is flawed. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances first, but then incorrectly compares the blocks directly without considering the order in which they are stored. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with differently ordered blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is done in a consistent and predictable way. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks of both instances before comparing them. This will ensure that the order of the blocks does not affect the result of the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations before comparing them, we ensure a consistent comparison approach that accounts for the potential block order differences in different `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
