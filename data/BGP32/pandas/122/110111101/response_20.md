### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the inconsistency in comparing blocks of different data types in the `BlockManager`. The function currently sorts and compares blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to incorrect comparisons and ultimately a wrong result.

When comparing two `BlockManager` objects, the function should consider the data type of the blocks correctly to ensure accurate equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle different block types based on their data types. We should include a check for the block's data type before deciding on their order. This change will ensure that blocks are sorted and compared correctly, leading to a more accurate equality check.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = block.dtype.name if isinstance(block, BlockNumeric) else "object"
        return (dtype_name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data type properly, we ensure that blocks are sorted and compared accurately, resolving the bug causing the failing test.
