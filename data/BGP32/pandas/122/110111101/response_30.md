### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances. Even when the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances match, the comparison of the blocks is flawed due to the sorting and comparison logic based on block types and locations. This faulty logic causes the function to return `True` incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes between the two `BlockManager` instances is correct.
2. Fix the sorting and comparison of blocks to ensure a proper comparison based on the elements within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values_hash, x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values_hash, x.mgr_locs))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on both the `values_hash` of the block and the `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent and accurate comparison between blocks. This correction should make the `equals` function behave as expected and pass the failing test.
