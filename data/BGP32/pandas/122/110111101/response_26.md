The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises due to the comparison logic of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function and then compares each pair of blocks. However, the canonicalization function does not consider the correct attributes of the blocks, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the relevant characteristics of each block for sorting and comparison. We can modify the canonicalization to include the block shape, data type, and location information to ensure a complete and accurate comparison of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly compare the two `BlockManager` instances based on the specified characteristics of the blocks, ensuring a successful comparison and fixing the bug.
