### Explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly compare two BlockManager instances for equality. The issue arises from the sorting of blocks inside the `equals` function. The blocks are sorted based on a combination of the block type name and `mgr_locs`; however, the latter is extracted using `as_array.tolist()`, leading to incorrect values being compared during block sorting.

### Bug:
The bug in the function `equals` stems from the inconsistent handling of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function. The incorrect extraction of `mgr_locs` causes the sorting to be incorrect, leading to the mismatch between expected and actual results.

### Fix:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that `mgr_locs` is appropriately accessed and used for sorting the blocks. By updating the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that blocks are sorted and compared accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two BlockManager instances and pass the failing test case provided.
