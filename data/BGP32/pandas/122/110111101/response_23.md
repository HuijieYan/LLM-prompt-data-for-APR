### Bug Explanation
The buggy `equals` function fails to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then attempts to compare their blocks. However, the comparison logic for the blocks is faulty and leads to incorrect results.

The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the buggy function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` based on the test case. This error arises because the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function iterates over sorted blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManagers and attempts to use the `equals` method of the Block objects. This comparison strategy is flawed and does not correctly determine equality between the two BlockManagers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Instead of relying solely on the `equals` method of each block, we should compare the block data directly to ensure equality. This approach will provide a more robust and accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the block values directly to ensure equality between the two `BlockManager` instances. By comparing the data within the blocks, we can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
