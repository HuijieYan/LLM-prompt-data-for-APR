### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison and sorting of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue is in the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. The bug occurs because the `mgr_locs` attribute is compared as a list (after converting it to a list using `as_array.tolist()`), which causes incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of `mgr_locs` retains the correct order for sorting blocks. We can achieve this by directly using the `mgr_locs` attribute without converting it to a list. This will maintain the correct order for comparison and sorting.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly using `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure the correct comparison and sorting of blocks, which should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
