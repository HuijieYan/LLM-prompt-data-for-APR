### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from how the blocks are sorted before performing the comparison. The bug is causing the comparison to fail even when the actual block content is equivalent.

1. The error message shows that the assertion fails because `True` is being compared to `False`. This indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.

2. The bug occurs in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple of `(dtype.name, mgr_locs)` to be used for sorting. This sorting mechanism is failing to correctly order the blocks. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their actual content for comparison. One approach is to compare blocks directly without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the failing test will pass as expected.
