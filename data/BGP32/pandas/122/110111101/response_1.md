### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to canonicalize the order of the blocks based on their dtype name and the manager locations. However, due to block sorting based on the `canonicalize` function, the ordering is inconsistent, leading to a false assertion in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently based on their dtype name and manager locations. Additionally, we should aim to improve the comparison logic in the `equals` function to correctly identify differences between the two BlockManager instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures consistent block ordering based on dtype name and compares blocks directly, addressing the issues highlighted in the failing test scenario.
