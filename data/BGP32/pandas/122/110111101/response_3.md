### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results and causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The issue arises when comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` object isn't handled correctly, resulting in improper sorting and matching of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers all relevant attributes accurately. Since the comparison logic in the `equals` function itself is incorrect, we need to modify it to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute during the block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances will properly take into account the `mgr_locs` attribute, addressing the issue observed in the failing test.
