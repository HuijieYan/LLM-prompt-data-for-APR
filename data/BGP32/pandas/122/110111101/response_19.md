### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The issue stems from how the blocks are sorted. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly as an array which leads to incorrect comparison and sorting of blocks. This results in the `equals` function returning incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to access the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly within the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper block sorting based on both data type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are sorted correctly based on their data type name and `mgr_locs` attributes, addressing the bug in the initial implementation.
