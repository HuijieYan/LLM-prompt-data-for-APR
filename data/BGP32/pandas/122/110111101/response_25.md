### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks if the axes of both instances are equal, consolidates them, and then compares the blocks in a canonical order. The bug seems to be in the comparison step where it iterates over the blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects them to be considered not equal. The actual buggy function implementation of `equals` doesn't handle this case correctly, leading to a false positive equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to correctly handle cases where the order of the columns matters. One approach could be to compare the blocks based on their column names rather than a direct comparison. This way, we can ensure that the order of columns does not affect the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on `mgr_locs` during the comparison, we can ensure a consistent order that disregards the order of the columns. This modification should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected for the provided failing test.
