### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The blocks are sorted based on their types and manager locations, but the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly converting the manager locations to a list using `.as_array.tolist()`, which is causing incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the manager locations and ensure correct sorting of the blocks. We should consider comparing the blocks based on the type name and manager locations without converting them to a list.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs` directly without converting it to a list, we ensure proper sorting of the blocks based on their types and manager locations, resulting in correct comparison of the `BlockManager` objects for equality.
