### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from a mismatch in the block order comparison logic. The function attempts to check equality between two `BlockManager` instances by sorting the blocks based on block type and manager locations. However, the comparison of blocks fails due to incorrect canonicalization of the blocks, resulting in a false equality verdict when distinct block types exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block type and manager locations correctly. This will ensure that blocks with different types but the same data values are not falsely marked as unequal. By modifying the comparison criteria in the sorting step, we can achieve a correct equality check between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function considering the bug fix strategy described above:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name and locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adopting this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of `BlockManager` instances will accurately check for equality based on the block types and manager locations, resolving the bug.
