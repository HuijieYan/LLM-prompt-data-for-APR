### Explanation:
The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs because the function does not properly compare the blocks after sorting. Due to the sorting based on `canonicalize`, the order of the blocks can change, causing the comparison to fail even if the blocks are equal.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function. It sorts blocks based on the data type name and the memory locations, which can lead to a different order of blocks, causing the comparison to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks based on the data type name and the block's values, instead of memory locations. This will ensure that blocks are compared correctly even if the order changes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting blocks based on the data type name and values, we ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
