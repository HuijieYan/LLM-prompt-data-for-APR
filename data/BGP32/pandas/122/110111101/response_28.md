### Explanation:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes and blocks for equality. The bug arises from how the function handles the sorting and comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. 

In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames with columns in different order. The `equals` method is expected to return `False` since the columns are not in the same order.

The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function where the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is converted to a list improperly using `as_array.tolist()` method. This malformed conversion of `mgr_locs` leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to properly convert the `mgr_locs` attribute to a tuple before comparing blocks. This way, blocks with different orders but the same content will be correctly recognized as different, resulting in the expected output for the failing test case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By using `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we properly represent the location information of the blocks as a tuple, ensuring correct sorting and comparison of blocks. This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
