### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from inappropriately comparing the content of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the order of the blocks. The function first sorts the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on their types and locations. However, the way it compares the blocks afterwards does not reflect the sorted order, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done in the sorted order. This involves correctly aligning the sorted blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Corrected comparison by aligning the sorted blocks
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version ensures that the sorted blocks from `self` and `other` are aligned properly for comparison, fixing the bug in the function.
