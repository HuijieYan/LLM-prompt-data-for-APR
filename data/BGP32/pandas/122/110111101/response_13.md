### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises due to the comparison of the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. In the buggy function, the blocks are sorted based on a function `canonicalize`, which sorts the blocks by their data type name and manager locations. However, the comparison of the blocks within the sorted lists is flawed as it uses the `equals` method on each block pair. This leads to incorrect results since the `equals` method is not implemented to compare blocks properly in this context.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is accurate without relying on the `equals` method alone. One approach is to compare the block data directly instead of using the `equals` method. This can be achieved by comparing the block data values and data types individually.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for blk1, blk2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if blk1.shape != blk2.shape:
            return False
        if blk1.dtype != blk2.dtype:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(blk1.values, blk2.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` method now compares the blocks based on their shapes, data types, and actual data values to determine equality. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` instances and should resolve the bug encountered in the failing test.
