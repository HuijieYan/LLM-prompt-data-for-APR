### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to compare the blocks based on their type names and manager locations, but it fails to consider the correct order of comparison. This leads to a mismatch between the block contents, causing the equality check to fail even when the data is equivalent.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should sort the blocks based on type names and manager locations before checking for equality. This will ensure a consistent comparison order and proper equality check between the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,
            (block.mgr_locs.indexer, block.mgr_locs.mgr_locs),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type names and manager locations before comparing them, the corrected version of the `equals` function ensures a proper and consistent comparison, which should fix the bug identified in the failing test.
