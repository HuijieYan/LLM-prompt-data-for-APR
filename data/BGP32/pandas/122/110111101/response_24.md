### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the function compares the block order between two `BlockManager` instances incorrectly. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`, which uses the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to determine uniqueness. However, the comparison does not consider the actual values in the blocks, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic should focus on comparing the actual block values rather than the block characteristics. This involves comparing each individual block from `self` and `other` instances directly, which ensures a correct comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances will now correctly compare the block contents rather than their characteristics, ensuring the equality check is accurate. This revised logic should pass the failing test case provided.
