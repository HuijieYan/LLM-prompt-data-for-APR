### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of Pandas core internals.
2. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block order.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` containing different data types and checks if the `equals` function returns `False`, which it should.
4. The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
5. The expected input/output values for the failing test are specified.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances without considering the order of the axes.
2. It then consolidates both instances in place using `_consolidate_inplace` and compares the number of blocks they contain.
3. The function then sorts the blocks based on the type name and memory locations of the blocks to compare them, leading to unexpected equal comparisons due to different memory locations for identical blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison of axes to consider the order of the axes.
2. Skip consolidation before comparison as it can impact memory locations.
3. Update the block canonicalization to avoid relying on memory locations for equality comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()  # Compare values directly
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by comparing the values directly instead of relying on memory locations. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly treated as not equal.
