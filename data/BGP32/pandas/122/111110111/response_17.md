### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. 
2. The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances by their axes, blocks, and block order.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` compares two DataFrames that have different column data types and values.
4. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement failed because it expected `True` to be `False`.
5. The bug occurs due to not handling the case of DataFrames with different data types correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not considering the ordering of blocks based on their data types and locations when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This leads to the wrong evaluation of equality between two DataFrames.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to appropriately compare blocks with different data types and locations. We can sort the blocks based on data type and then location to ensure consistency in comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function handles the sorting of blocks based on data types and locations to ensure proper comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
