The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class occurs because the comparison between blocks is not taking into account the actual values within the blocks but is instead comparing the blocks' attributes directly. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different values.

To fix this issue, the comparison between blocks should iterate over the actual data values within the blocks, checking for equality between corresponding elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version iterates over each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and it explicitly compares the content of each corresponding block to determine equality.

After implementing this correction, re-run the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to verify that the corrected version now passes the test.
