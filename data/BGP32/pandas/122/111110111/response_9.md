### Explanation of the Bug:

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue is with the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` where the order of the blocks is compared using `block.equals(oblock)`, assuming that blocks are sorted in the same order for both `self` and `other` BlockManagers. However, the blocks may have different location indices, leading to incorrect comparisons and returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists by sorting them based on a unique identifier that considers all block characteristics (such as dtype and location) to avoid incorrectly returning `True`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalizing the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting key to include the `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that blocks are compared based on all relevant attributes, including their locations, addressing the bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered equal.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output value of `False` when comparing the given DataFrames.
