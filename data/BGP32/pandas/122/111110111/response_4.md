### Explanation of the Bug

1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class and is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It compares certain aspects such as axes and blocks.

2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with swapped columns and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`.

3. The error message shows that the assertion is failing because `assert True is False`. This indicates the buggy function is returning `True` incorrectly instead of the expected `False`.

4. The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. However, due to a sorting inconsistency in how the blocks are being sorted, the equality check does not yield the correct result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. To fix the bug, the block sorting mechanism needs to be consistent before comparing individual blocks.
2. We should ensure that the `blocks` are sorted properly based on their type name and then on `mgr_locs` before performing the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().start)  # Sort based on block type and start of the slice

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison, leading to the correct equality check result.
