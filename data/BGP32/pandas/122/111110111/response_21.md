### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in self and other BlockManagers within a tuple. The comparison depends on sorting and then performing a block-wise equality check. The error occurs because the tuple creation and sorting do not account for the exact location of blocks in memory and only consider the blockâ€™s dtype name and `mgr_locs` (which can be unconsolidated). As a result, blocks with the same content but different memory locations are mistakenly considered unequal, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Fixing Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to consider the specific block content along with dtype name for comparison. By explicitly specifying the block content, we can ensure that blocks with the same content but different memory locations will be considered equal. This modification will accurately determine equality between self and other BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Updated canonicalize function to consider block content
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_hashable().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `equals` function considers the specific content of blocks for equality comparison, thus addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
