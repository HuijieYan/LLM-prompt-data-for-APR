### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and determine if they are equal based on certain conditions.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks, and then compares each block individually.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values for each column and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
4. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`.
5. The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are provided, which indicate the correct behavior that should be implemented.
6. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `DataFrame.equals()` returns `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function stems from the comparison of blocks. In the `canonicalize` function, the comparison of blocks is not considering the location of the blocks correctly. Therefore, two identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, leading to the incorrect return value.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the block locations in the comparison process. By including the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, we can differentiate between blocks that are identical but located differently.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to consider the block locations as well, the comparison of blocks will be more robust and take into account differences in block locations. This correction should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function behave as expected in the failing test.
