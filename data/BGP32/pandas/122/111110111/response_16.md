### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares different aspects of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
3. The bug occurs when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes, especially when sorting and comparing the blocks.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`.
5. The bug causes the `assert True is False` assertion error because the `equals()` function wrongly returns `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals(self, other)` function arises when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The bug can be summarized as follows:
- When comparing the blocks, the function sorts the blocks in both objects based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize(block)` using the block's data type name and `mgr_locs`.
- The issue lies in this sorting process, mainly due to the incorrect comparison of blocks based on `mgr_locs`.
- If two blocks have the same data but different `mgr_locs` (locations of the blocks), the function incorrectly identifies them as not being equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison mechanism for blocks in the `BlockManager.equals` function. The comparison should focus on the data itself rather than the block locations. This adjustment will ensure that blocks with the same data are considered equal even if they are at different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to return the byte representation of the block's values for comparison, we prioritize the content of the blocks rather than their locations. This correction should ensure that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal, resolving the bug.
