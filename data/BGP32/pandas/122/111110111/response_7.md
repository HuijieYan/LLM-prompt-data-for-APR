### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.
2. The buggy function extracts the `axes` and `blocks` attributes from both instances.
3. It then compares the lengths of the `axes` to ensure they have the same number of axes.
4. Next, it compares all the axes pairwise using the `equals` method.
5. It consolidates the data in place for both instances using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
6. It checks if the number of blocks in each instance is the same. If not, it returns `False`.
7. It then sorts the blocks based on the type name and locations.
8. Finally, it compares each pair of blocks between the two instances.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations. This results in unexpected behavior, as seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The main issue arises from how the function compares blocks using `mgr_locs`. Since different blocks with the same data can have different locations due to sorting or consolidation, comparing blocks based solely on `mgr_locs` can lead to false positives in the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are compared. Instead of relying solely on `mgr_locs`, we should compare the data within the blocks directly. Additionally, we can improve the efficiency of the comparison by avoiding unnecessary sorting of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the data within blocks, ensuring that two `BlockManager` instances are considered equal only if all their blocks have the same content, even if the locations differ.
