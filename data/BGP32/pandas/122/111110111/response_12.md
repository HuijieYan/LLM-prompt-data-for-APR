### Identified Bug:
The bug in the provided function `equals(self, other)` is that it incorrectly returns True even when the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same content, but different locations in memory.

### Explanation of the Bug:
1. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If they are not, it directly returns False, which is correct behavior.
2. It then compares each axis in `self_axes` with the corresponding axis in `other_axes` using the `equals` method. If any of these comparisons fail, it returns False, which is also correct behavior.
3. After that, it consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other` using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. This method is called to ensure that the blocks are in a consistent state for comparison.
4. The bug arises when comparing the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized form of each block, combining the type name and `mgr_locs`.
5. The bug occurs when comparing the sorted blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`. The `equals` method of the block does not consider the block's memory locations in the comparison, leading to incorrect equality assessment when the content is the same, but the memory locations differ.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` method should not only compare the content of the blocks but also consider the memory location when making comparisons. This way, blocks with the same content but different memory locations will not be falsely identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, `tobytes` method is used to include the memory location in the comparison, ensuring correct identification of equality based on both content and memory location.
