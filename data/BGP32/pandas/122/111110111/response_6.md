### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This method compares two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal in terms of block components.
2. The bug occurs when comparing blocks in different order due to the way they are sorted, causing the comparison to fail even if the blocks contain the same data.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug is in the `equals` method where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted based on a canonicalization function.
2. The issue arises when consolidating the order of blocks, causing blocks with the same data but different locations to be considered unequal, leading to an incorrect comparison result.
3. This bug was reported in GitHub issue #28839, where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are canonicalized for comparison, ensuring that the comparison is based on block content rather than location.
2. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to focus on the block content instead of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` array.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly based on data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block_values_as_list(block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

def block_values_as_list(block):
    result = []
    for value in block.values:
        if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):
            result.append(value.tolist())
        else:
            result.append(value)
    return result
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to directly compare the values within the block, rather than their dtype names and locations, the corrected version of the `equals` method will properly compare the `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result for the failing test case.
