### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects by first checking the number of axes and then proceeding to compare the blocks.
2. The error occurs when the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function is not working as expected.
3. The function tries to compare the blocks in different `BlockManager` objects but does not account for the specific locations of those blocks, leading to false comparisons.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the locations of the blocks to ensure accurate comparisons.
5. Based on the provided information, we can correct the function to properly compare the blocks and return the correct result.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, repr(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the representation of `mgr_locs` when sorting blocks, we ensure that the comparison accounts for the specific locations of the blocks. This correction should address the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
