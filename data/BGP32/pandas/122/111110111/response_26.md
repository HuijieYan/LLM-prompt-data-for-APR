### Bugs identified:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two BlockManager instances but the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
2. The function is using inconsistent variable names for self and other attributes (`self`, `self_axes`, `other`, `other_axes`) which might cause confusion.
3. The function does not handle the case where two blocks have identical values but different locations.

### Bug cause:
The bug arises from the flawed logic in the equality comparison performed within the `equals()` function. It does not properly consider situations where two blocks might have the same values but different locations. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two BlockManager instances.

### Fix strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to improve the equality comparison logic of the `equals()` function. We should consider a more robust way to compare the blocks between the two BlockManager instances and take block locations into account. One potential approach could be to compare the blocks based on both the values and the locations in a sorted order.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check the equality of each axis
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare blocks based on type and location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs)))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on both type and location in the corrected version, we can ensure that the comparison is more robust and takes into account the differences in block locations.
