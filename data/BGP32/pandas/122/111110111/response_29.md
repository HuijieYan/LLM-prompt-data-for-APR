### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The buggy function compares the axes of two BlockManager instances before sorting and comparing their blocks. The issue arises because when comparing axes, it should compare the values present in the axes rather than the axes themselves.
2. To fix the bug, the axes of both BlockManager instances should be compared directly by converting them to lists before comparing their values.
3. After fixing the axes comparison, ensure that the block comparison is correctly implemented by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = [list(ax) for ax in self.axes]
    other_axes = [list(ax) for ax in other.axes]
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using dtype name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the comparison of axes and ensuring proper sorting of blocks, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
