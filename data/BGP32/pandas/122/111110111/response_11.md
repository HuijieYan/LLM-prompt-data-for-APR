### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` using the `equals` method. It checks if the axes are equal, consolidates both instances in place, then compares the blocks within them.
2. The error occurs because the two `BlockManager` instances have different blocks but they are identical in content. The order of the blocks is not taken into account during the comparison.
3. The error message states that the assertion expects `True` to be `False`, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two different instances.
4. To fix the bug, a sorting key should be used when comparing the blocks to ensure consistency in the order of the blocks.
5. The sorting should happen in a way that matches the criteria for equality in the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block type name and managerial locations.
6. By sorting both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparison, we can consider the blocks equal as long as their types and locations match, regardless of the order.

### Recommended Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will ensure that the blocks are compared consistently with their types and locations taken into account and ignore the order of the blocks when determining equality.
