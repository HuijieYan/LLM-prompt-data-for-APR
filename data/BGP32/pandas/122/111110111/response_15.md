### Correction of the buggy function

To address the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared properly. The bug arises from comparing the blocks without considering their locations correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.get_values().dtype.name,  # Use get_values() to access the block data
            block.mgr_locs.to_slice_indexer().tolist(),  # Convert mgr_locs to slice_indexer for comparison
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- Inside the `canonicalize` function, we extract the block's data using `get_values()` and convert the `mgr_locs` to `slice_indexer` for proper comparison.
- Sorting is done based on the block data type name and the converted location.
- The comparison is performed between the sorted self and other blocks.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function work as intended.

By applying this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass and return the expected value of `False`. 

Feel free to integrate this corrected code into the pandas library to fix the bug associated with the `equals` function.
