### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances by their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data but the same column labels `a` and `b`, which should result in `False` when compared using the `equals` method.
- The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
- The bug is likely related to the comparison logic of the blocks within the `equals` function.
- Based on the GitHub issue, the correction is expected to address the incorrect return value issue in the `equals` method when blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `equals` function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. Then, it compares each axis using the `equals` method. After that, it consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other` using `_consolidate_inplace`. Finally, it compares the blocks themselves.
- The bug appears to be in the comparison of the blocks. It is sorting the blocks by their dtype name and location (mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()), which may not be a reliable way to determine if the blocks are equal, especially if they have identical data but different locations.
- This incorrect comparison logic leads to the function wrongly returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations with identical data.

### Suggested Fix:
- To fix the bug, the comparison strategy should be revised. Instead of solely relying on sorting blocks based on dtype and location, a more comprehensive approach should be taken to compare the actual data in the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly by iterating
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This revised version directly compares the blocks' content rather than sorting them based on dtype and location, ensuring a more accurate check for equality.
