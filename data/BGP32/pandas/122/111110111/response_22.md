### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue arises from the comparison failing due to identical blocks with different locations, causing `df1.equals(df2)` to return `True` incorrectly.
3. The comparison logic is attempting to sort the blocks using a canonicalize function that includes the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The incorrect comparison leads to the failing test case.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to include additional checks to ensure that identical blocks are compared correctly.

### Fix Strategy
1. We need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly compare blocks that have identical content but different locations.
2. To achieve this, we can compare the actual `values` within the blocks for equality instead of just using the dtype name and locations.
3. By modifying the comparison logic in `equals`, we can ensure that blocks with the same content will be recognized as equal, even if their locations differ.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare the values within the blocks and modifying the main comparison logic to check for equal content and dtype, we can ensure that the `equals` function works correctly and passes the failing test case.
