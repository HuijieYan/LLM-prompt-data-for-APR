### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class defined a method `equals` that compares two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data values and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method. This test is failing with an assertion error.
3. The expected values of the input parameters and variables suggest that the blocks within `BlockManager` instances need to be sorted before comparison to ensure consistency.
4. The error message indicates that even though the two instances are not equal, the comparison is failing due to differences in block order.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to fail due to inconsistent block order. The function should sort the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to sort the blocks before comparison. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on a canonical representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fixed version of the `equals` method will sort the blocks before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and correct.
