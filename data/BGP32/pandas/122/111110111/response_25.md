Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class is related to comparing two block managers for equality. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks based on their order rather than their content. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version directly compares the blocks' content for equality instead of relying on their order. This change should correct the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the `equals()` function function as expected when compared with the failing test case.
