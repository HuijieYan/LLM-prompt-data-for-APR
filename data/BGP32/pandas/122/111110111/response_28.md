## Bug Analysis:

1. **Relationship with Buggy Class and Related Functions:**
    - The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas to handle DataFrame, Series, etc.
    - The function uses other internal methods like `_consolidate_inplace()` and `as_array()` present in the same class.

2. **Identified Error Location:**
    - The bug arises in the line where the blocks are compared between two instances. The ordering of the blocks based on their type and locations causes the issue.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
    - The bug occurs because the comparison does not consider the internal block order adequately, leading to `True` being returned even for different block placements.

4. **Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
    - To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks by considering block types and locations in a more precise manner.
    - Specifically, we need to include the block placement information in the comparison to ensure accurate results.

5. **Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by incorporating mgr_locs into comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include `.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the comparison key, we ensure that the block placements are considered during block ordering. This correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
