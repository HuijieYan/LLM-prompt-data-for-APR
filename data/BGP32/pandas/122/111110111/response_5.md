### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal using the `equals()` function.
3. The failing test expects the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` to pass but it fails due to a bug in the `equals()` function logic.
4. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` failed, indicating that the `equals()` function incorrectly returned `True`.
5. The expected input/output values have been defined for the buggy function to ensure the corrected version meets these expectations.
6. The issue on GitHub describes the failing test scenario and expected output, highlighting the bug in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises in the `equals()` function where the comparison logic for self and other `BlockManager` objects is incorrect.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects. The blocks' locations are not appropriately handled during comparison, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that when comparing blocks, the comparison takes into account the blocks' locations properly to determine equality.
2. Review the comparison logic for axis and blocks to make sure they accurately reflect the equality conditions.
3. Sort the blocks based on a combination of type name and location information to normalize the order for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the correct sorting and canonicalization of blocks by their type name and locations, the corrected function ensures the blocks are compared accurately for equality. The corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values and should resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
