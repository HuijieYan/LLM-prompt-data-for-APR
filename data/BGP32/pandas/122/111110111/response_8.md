### Fixing the bug in the given function:

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes lengths could be incorrect.
2. Unconsolidated blocks might cause issues in comparison.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks and axes. The issue lies in the way the `equals` function is implemented. When comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations, the function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to test failures.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the actual contents of the blocks rather than their locations. By sorting the blocks based on some key and then comparing them, we can ensure that the comparison is correct even for unconsolidated blocks.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are ordered based on their values, and then their values are compared for equality.

By using this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
