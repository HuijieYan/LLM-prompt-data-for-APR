### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It first checks if the number of axes is equal between the two instances. Then, it calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both instances, and compares the number of blocks they have. Lastly, it sorts the blocks based on the block's data type name and location to perform a comparison.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns in a different order and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`.

3. The error occurs when the buggy `equals` function returns `False` when it should return `True` due to the block equality check being incorrect. The error message shows that `assert True is False`, indicating that despite the data frames being unequal, the function returned `True`.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Ensure that the comparison is based on blocks equality and not on the order of the blocks.
   - Update the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block's data to ensure correct sorting for comparison.
   - Consider using a more robust method for block comparison.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # new canonicalize function with block metadata for proper sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By incorporating the block's metadata in the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison logic, the corrected function should address the issue and correctly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances.
