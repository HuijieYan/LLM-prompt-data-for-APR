### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. It checks the length of the axes of both instances, then iterates over axis pairs and eventually compares all blocks in the instances for equality.
3. The bug arises from how blocks are sorted and compared for equality, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Locations:
1. The bug is likely due to the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare blocks.
2. Incorrect sorting or equality comparison of blocks might be the cause of the bug.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs in the `equals` function while comparing two `BlockManager` instances, resulting in incorrect outputs.
2. The error message shows that the equality comparison fails, leading to unexpected truth assertion behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the sorting mechanism used for blocks does not impact their equality comparison.
2. Review the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function.
3. Check if the `equals` method for the blocks is correctly implemented.
4. Modify the comparison logic to accurately determine the equality of blocks.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.sort_values(ignore_index=True).to_list()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.sort_values(ignore_index=True).to_list()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts blocks using `sort_values` method before comparison, ensuring that the equality comparison is reliable and accurate.
