The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case fails because the DataFrames have different values in their columns, causing the expected behavior to return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to compare the values in the blocks of the DataFrames, rather than performing a simple comparison based on the blocks themselves. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks and comparing their values directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
            if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now iterates over each block in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, comparing their values to determine if the DataFrames are equal. This fix will ensure that the DataFrames with different values in the columns are correctly identified as not equal.
