## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then compares each block within them. The comparison is based on the type name of the block and `mgr_locs` attribute which is supposed to provide the locations of the block within the manager.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different types and values. It then compares them using the `equals` method which should return `False`, but it fails with an assertion error.
4. The bug seems to be related to not handling the case where blocks have different types or values which should result in inequality.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to account for blocks with different types or values, which should result in the two `BlockManager` objects being considered unequal.

## Updated Bug-Free Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This updated version of the `equals` method includes a modification in the `canonicalize` function to account for block types in the comparison. It will now return `False` if there is a mismatch in the block types or values, ensuring a correct comparison for equality.
