The bug in the provided function arises due to the incorrect comparison of two dataframes. This issue leads to failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` where two dataframes with different values are incorrectly identified as equal, causing the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the values of the corresponding elements in both dataframes rather than comparing the dataframes directly. We can achieve this by modifying the `equals()` function to iterate through the data blocks and check the equality of corresponding elements in each block.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version iterates through the blocks of both the `self` and `other` objects and uses `np.array_equal()` to check the equality of the values in each block. This ensures that the equality comparison is done at the element-level, thus correctly identifying the dataframes as not equal in the provided failing test.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
