## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `equals(self, other)`, the issue is with the `canonicalize` function that is used for sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug arises from the usage of the `.as_array` method in the `canonicalize` function. The correct usage should be accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute directly to convert it to a list, instead of calling `.as_array` directly on it.

The bug causes the failure of the test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, as seen in the error message. The function `equals` is not working as expected and incorrectly reports equality between two different DataFrames.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute and then convert it to a list. This will ensure that the sorting mechanism operates correctly.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.blocks[0].mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should work correctly, and the failing test should pass as expected.
