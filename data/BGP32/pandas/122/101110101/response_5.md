The bug in the provided function is causing the `equals` method to return incorrect results when comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug is likely in the block canonicalization process where the block data type and manager locations are used to sort the blocks before comparison. 

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the block canonicalization process is consistent and properly handles the `mgr_locs` attribute. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.__hash__)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

This corrected version of the function should now properly compare two instances of `BlockManager` and pass the failing test case mentioned.
