The bug in the provided function `equals` is due to the comparison of DataFrames that have columns in different orders. The function incorrectly reports that the DataFrames are equal, resulting in the failing test case.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares DataFrames without considering the order of columns. This leads to a false positive result when comparing DataFrames with columns in different orders.
2. The failing test case expects the function to correctly identify that `df1` and `df2` are not equal because their columns are in different orders.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between DataFrames results in `True is False`, which is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the order of columns. We can achieve this by sorting the columns before comparison to ensure consistent order across DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly compare DataFrames, taking into account the column order. This modification should allow the failing test case to pass as expected.
