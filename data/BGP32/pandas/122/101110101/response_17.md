### Explanation:
The buggy function is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the buggy function ignores the type of blocks and their locations within the manager, which leads to incorrect comparison results. The function sorts the blocks based only on the dtype name, which is insufficient for an accurate comparison.

### Bug in the code:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based solely on the dtype name and ignores the mgr_locs (block locations within the manager). This leads to incorrect comparison results when the block order or locations are different between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison should take into account both the dtype name and the mgr_locs of the blocks. By including the block locations in the sorting key, the function can ensure that blocks with the same dtype but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations in a tuple, we ensure a more accurate comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test case pass.
