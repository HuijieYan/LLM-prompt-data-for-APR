## Analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal. The function compares the axes, consolidates the block structure, and then compares individual blocks within the `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the comparison is incorrect, resulting in a failed assertion.

The `test_dataframe_not_equal` function creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different column types and values and expects them to be not equal. This failing test utilizes the `equals` method of `BlockManager` incorrectly.

## Bug
The bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. It compares the blocks within `BlockManager` without considering the actual values in each block. This leads to `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly evaluating to `True`.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the actual values stored in the blocks. We can iterate over the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances and compare the values within those blocks.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the individual blocks' values instead of just their structure. This change ensures that the comparison considers the actual data stored in the `BlockManager` instances.
