### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, implying that the expected behavior is for the two DataFrames to be considered not equal. However, the test result shows `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` comparison is not returning the correct result.

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is improperly implemented, leading to the incorrect comparison and assertion failure. The function is comparing the self and other axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks within those axes. However, there are issues in handling and sorting the blocks accurately, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are correctly compared. This involves properly canonicalizing the blocks before comparison to account for unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) that need special handling. By accurately sorting and comparing the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, we can ensure that the equality check produces the correct result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the blocks are properly sorted and compared based on their type and manager locations, the corrected `equals` function should now provide the correct equality comparison for the `BlockManager` objects, passing the failing test case.
