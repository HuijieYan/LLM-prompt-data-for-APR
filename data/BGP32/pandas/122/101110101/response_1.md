The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing it to fail in the test scenario where two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are compared using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that it encounters an assertion error because the comparison result is not as expected.

The bug is likely in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. It compares the axes of `self` and `other`, then consolidates both `self` and `other`, and finally compares the blocks within them. The issue might arise from how the blocks are compared, potentially due to inconsistent order or referencing.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate and consistent. One possible strategy is to compare the blocks directly using their content, considering their data type, values, and order. Sorting the blocks based on their data type and/or values before comparison could help resolve the inconsistency issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks in a sorted and consistent manner. The corrected function should now pass the failing test scenario and return the expected output.
