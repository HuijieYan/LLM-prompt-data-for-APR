### Correction of the buggy function

To correct the buggy function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the two BlockManager instances considers the values inside each block. The current implementation only sorts the blocks based on their dtype and location, which leads to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, instead of sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, we sort the blocks based on the values inside each block by converting them to bytes (`block.values.tobytes()`). This ensures a proper comparison of the block content between the two BlockManager instances.

This correction addresses the issue identified in the failing test case and ensures that the `equals` function correctly compares two instances of BlockManager.
