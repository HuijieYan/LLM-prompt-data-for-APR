The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of dataframe blocks in the wrong order. The buggy implementation sorts the blocks using a canonicalization function but fails to consider the block type differences before comparison.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function sorts both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`.
2. Since the dtype name is the same for different block types (e.g., 'int64'), the sorting only accounts for the location of the blocks.
3. This approach fails to correctly distinguish and compare blocks of different types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the canonicalize function to incorporate the block type before sorting.
2. Ensure that the comparison between blocks considers both the block type and location for a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By integrating the block type into the canonicalize function and subsequent sorting, the corrected function should now properly compare blocks based on both type and location, resolving the bug identified in the original implementation.
