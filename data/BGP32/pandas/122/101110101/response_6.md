### Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and the content of each block.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and checks if they are equal using the `equals` function, expecting the result to be `False`.
3. The error occurs because when comparing the DataFrames, the `equals` function in `BlockManager` returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison made in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. It is due to sorting the block data based on their type names and memory locations without considering the actual values they hold.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider the actual data values in the blocks instead of just the type names and memory locations. We can add a new comparison check before checking the equality of blocks that considers the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    # Check if the block data is equal
    if any(not block._oblock.equals(oblock._oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False

    return True
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function now includes a check to compare the actual block data in addition to the block type names and memory locations. This change ensures the correct comparison of `BlockManager` instances based on their content.
