The bug in the provided function is located in the `canonicalize` function where `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly. The function should use `block.mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Explanation of the bug:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager instances by iterating through their blocks. 
- The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type names and manager locations.
- The bug arises when `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is used inside `canonicalize`. This is incorrect because `as_array` is not a method, and it should be simply `block.mgr_locs`.

To fix the bug, we need to edit the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected function should now compare the blocks in the two BlockManager instances correctly and pass the failing test you provided.

Please replace the buggy function in the `managers.py` file with this corrected version and re-run the failing test to verify that it now passes.
