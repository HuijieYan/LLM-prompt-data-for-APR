The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function attempts to compare blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the handling of these attributes might be causing issues. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is correctly implemented by considering all relevant attributes. Specifically, we should compare the `dtype.name` and the contents of `mgr_locs` properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Perform block-wise comparison
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):  # Additional check for blocks
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted and then compared based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing test case.
