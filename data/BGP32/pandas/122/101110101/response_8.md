### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrames` that are expected to be unequal and tests the `equals` method of `DataFrame` objects (which internally uses the `equals` method of `BlockManager` objects).
3. The error message indicates that the comparison of `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returned `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.
4. The bug in the `equals` method likely stems from the sorting of blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a custom `canonicalize` function. The sort order based on block type and `mgr_locs` might not correctly distinguish between unequal blocks.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely arises from the `canonicalize` function's inability to properly differentiate between blocks, leading to incorrect sorting. This incorrect sorting causes the equality check to fail even though the blocks are not equal.

### Bug Fix
To address the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks with a method that guarantees equal blocks will be considered equal and unequal blocks will be distinct. One approach is to directly compare the blocks in a different way rather than relying on a complex sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison is directly done between blocks without relying on sorting, ensuring that unequal blocks are properly identified as so.
