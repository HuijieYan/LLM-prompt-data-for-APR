### Fixing the Bug

#### 1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- The comparison involves sorting the blocks of both instances to check for equality.
- The unexpected behavior might be due to incorrect block sorting or other issues within the function.

#### 2. Error Location:
- The bug could potentially arise from how the `canonicalize` function generates keys for sorting the blocks.
- The `canonicalize` function combines the `dtype.name` of a block with `mgr_locs` converted to a list. This concatenation might not provide a reliable ordering mechanism for all block types.

#### 3. Bug Cause:
- The bug is due to an unreliable sorting mechanism caused by the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect results when comparing blocks for equality.
- This unreliable sorting mechanism fails to handle certain data types and block arrangements, resulting in unexpected `True` return instead of `False`.

#### 4. Fix Strategy:
- Improve the `canonicalize` function to create more unique and reliable keys for block sorting.
- Consider incorporating additional identifiers or sorting criteria to ensure consistent ordering of blocks.

#### Corrected Version of the Bug-Fix Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Improved canonicalize function

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the type of the block as well as the `mgr_locs` converted to a list, we create a more reliable sorting mechanism. This improvement should address the issue of incorrect block comparisons and ensure the function works as intended.
