### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug arises because the function does not handle cases where the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are in different orders. As a result, the function fails to properly check the equality, leading to the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are sorted in a canonical order before comparing them for equality. This will allow for a consistent comparison even if the blocks are in different orders.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function now sorts the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances before comparing them for equality. This ensures a consistent comparison and should pass the failing test case.
