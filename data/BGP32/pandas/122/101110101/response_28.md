The bug in the provided `equals` function is related to the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) where the values in columns are of different types. The function is currently incorrectly comparing the two DataFrames and returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Error Identification:
1. The function loops through each block of the DataFrame to compare them.
2. The function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.
3. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types, which causes the comparison to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the function does not handle cases where the columns have different data types. When sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` function, it only considers the type name and `mgr_locs`, which is not sufficient for handling DataFrames with columns of different types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type of the blocks in addition to their type name and `mgr_locs`. By including the data type in the sorting criteria, we can ensure that blocks with different data types are not considered equal during comparison.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, dtype, and then mgr_locs to handle different data types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include `block.dtype` in the sorting criteria, we can ensure that blocks with different data types will be properly distinguished during comparison. This correction should address the bug and make the `equals` function handle DataFrame comparisons correctly.
