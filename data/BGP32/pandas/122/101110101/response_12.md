## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. 
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug arises when comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. The function iterates over the blocks, but it does not correctly handle the comparison logic.
4. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values for columns "a" and "b" and expects them to be non-equal. The assertion fails with an `AssertionError` because the buggy `equals` method incorrectly reports them as equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the values inside the blocks and not just their references.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tostring(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will compare the actual values present in the blocks and not just their references, ensuring correct equality comparison.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` as expected.
