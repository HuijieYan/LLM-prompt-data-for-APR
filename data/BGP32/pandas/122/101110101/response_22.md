### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the comparison logic seems incorrect as it fails the provided test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison evaluation returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The issue might lie in how the function compares blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.
4. To fix the bug, we need to examine the logic of comparing blocks and potentially address any issues in block comparison.
5. Adjust the comparison logic to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Correction
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on their type and location, ensuring a consistent order for comparison.
