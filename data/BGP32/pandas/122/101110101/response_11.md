### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block order. 
2. The failing test creates two DataFrames with different column orders to test the `equals` function, expecting it to return `False`.
3. The error message highlights an assertion error where `True is False`, indicating that the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug likely occurs in the comparison logic of the blocks within the `equals` function.
   
### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. It should compare the blocks in a sorted manner, but the comparison logic is incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the blocks in the `equals` function. We should sort and compare the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs attributes.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, we ensure a consistent comparison method that should fix the bug in the `equals` function.
