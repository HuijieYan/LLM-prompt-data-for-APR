The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely causing the test to fail. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by first checking the lengths of their axes, then comparing each axis individually, consolidating the blocks in both instances, and finally comparing the blocks themselves.

The bug is likely related to the order in which the blocks are sorted for comparison. The bug is likely causing the comparison between `df1.equals(df2)` in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

Here's how it can be fixed:
- Check if the order of blocks being compared is causing the failure.
- Sort the blocks with a method that encompasses more information to ensure a correct order of comparison.
- Make sure to consolidate both instances of `BlockManager` before comparing them.

Based on the provided buggy function, I will correct it by sorting the blocks using a combination of the data type name and `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case by properly comparing the blocks.
