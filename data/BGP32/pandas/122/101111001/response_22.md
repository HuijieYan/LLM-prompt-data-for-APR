### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different data types and values. When checking `df1.equals(df2)`, the test expects `False` since the data in the data frames is not the same but encounters an assertion error.

The bug in the function occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function first sorts the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple of the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. Here, `mgr_locs` is assumed to be a list due to the usage of `as_array.tolist()`. However, `mgr_locs` is an object of type `BlockPlacement` and not directly convertible to a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle converting the `mgr_locs` object into a format that can be used for comparison.
2. Ensure that the conversion operation does not rely on assumptions about the structure of `mgr_locs` but handles it in a way that is consistent with the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Correct handling of mgr_locs
        mgr_locs_list = block.mgr_locs.get_indexer()
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs_list)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `BlockPlacement` object's internal data for comparison, the corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
