### Bug Analysis
In the provided buggy function, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted before comparison.

The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is implemented to extract the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. However, the `.as_array.tolist()` method is incorrectly applied on the `mgr_locs` attribute, which results in a wrong comparison of block locations.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the sorting of blocks based on incorrect `mgr_locs` values due to the improper use of the `as_array.tolist()` method. This leads to the inequality check failing even when the actual data content of the blocks might be equal, resulting in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `mgr_locs` are correctly handled in the `canonicalize` function. Instead of using `.as_array.tolist()`, we can directly access the values of `mgr_locs` and store them in a list for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By using `list(block.mgr_locs)` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we can ensure that the `mgr_locs` are correctly converted to a list for sorting, fixing the bug and enabling the function to pass the failing test.
