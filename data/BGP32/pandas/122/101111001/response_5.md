### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The testcase `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides two `DataFrame` objects that are not equal, but the buggy function fails to correctly identify this and always returns `True`. 

By inspecting the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the function does not handle the comparison of `DataFrame` blocks correctly.

### Bug
The bug is in the logic that compares the blocks of the `DataFrame`. The function is sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to distinguish between blocks properly. This causes the incorrect output of `True`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic of comparing blocks in the `BlockManager` class, specifically the `equals` method. We should ensure that the equality check is done correctly between corresponding blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def are_blocks_equal(block, other_block):
        if block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False
        return block._can_compare(other_block) and block.equals(other_block)

    return all(are_blocks_equal(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks)))
``` 

This corrected version ensures that blocks are compared correctly and that the function returns the correct result when checking the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
