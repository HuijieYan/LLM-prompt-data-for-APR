### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect ordering of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks within each `BlockManager` object by `canonicalize` function, which takes the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of the blocks. When comparing the sorted blocks, it fails to properly compare and categorize the blocks leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their order. We can achieve this by directly comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager` object without sorting them.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances for equality without relying on the block order. This should now pass the failing test provided.
