### Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function goes through several steps to check if the axes, block lengths, and individual blocks are equal between the two `BlockManager` objects. However, the bug arises from the way the blocks are sorted before comparison.

In the provided failing test, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having values `[1, 2]` and `['s', 'd']`, respectively, in `df1`, and `'s'`, `1` and `'d'`, `2` in `df2`. An assertion is made that `df1` should not be equal to `df2`.

At runtime, the function sorts the blocks in each `BlockManager` object based on a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. The sorting is done incorrectly, leading to a failure in correctly identifying the inequality between the two DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on a more relevant criterion for equality comparison, possibly comparing the content of the blocks directly.
2. Ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to sort based on block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.to_list()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content for comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test successfully.
