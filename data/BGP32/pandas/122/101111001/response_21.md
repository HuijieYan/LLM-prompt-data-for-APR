### Analysis:
From the provided buggy function and the failing test, we can observe that the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if they are equal by comparing axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method. The error message highlights that the comparison returns `True` while it is expected to return `False`.

The buggy function seems to compare axes correctly but is sorting the blocks' order by `block.dtype.name` instead of the block values, which is incorrect. Sorting by `block.dtype.name` does not guarantee that the blocks are in a matching order. Hence, the function incorrectly considers the two `BlockManager` instances as equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method. Sorting according to `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not a correct way to determine the equality of blocks since it does not guarantee the correct order of blocks for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks based on their actual values rather than their data type names and block locations. This will ensure that we are comparing blocks in the correct order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will sort the blocks based on their actual values, ensuring correct comparison and addressing the bug causing the failing test.
