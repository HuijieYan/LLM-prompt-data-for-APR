### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The sorting logic in the function to compare blocks leads to incorrect ordering due to the way the `canonicalize` function is implemented. The sorting method doesn't take into account the ordering of columns in a DataFrame, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on the actual column order in the DataFrame. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both the column name and column order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the updated `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column order and name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on both the column order and column name, addressing the issue identified in the failing test.
