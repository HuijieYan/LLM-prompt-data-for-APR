### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises in the comparison process of two `BlockManager` objects in the `equals` function. The function compares the axis, then consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks based on their characteristics, and finally compares each block in the two `BlockManager` objects. However, the bug causes a failure in comparing the blocks correctly, leading to an incorrect evaluation of whether the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

The key issue is that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is incorrect. It compares the `dtype.name` of the block and the `mgr_locs` as a list, but since `mgr_locs` is a `BlockPlacement` object, there is no direct method to convert it to a list for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly create a comparable tuple for sorting the blocks. One approach could be to convert the `BlockPlacement` object, `mgr_locs`, into a list or another comparable object within the `canonicalize` function before creating the sorting keys.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            # Convert BlockPlacement object to a tuple for comparison
            mgr_locs_tuple = tuple(block.mgr_locs.Set._slice())
            return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs_tuple)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
