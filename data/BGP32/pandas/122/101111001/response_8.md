Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their types and locations. Since the two DataFrames in the failing test have different values in corresponding positions, the comparison fails. 

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the actual data values stored in the blocks.
2. The comparison is solely based on the type name and the locations (`mgr_locs`) of the blocks which is causing the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the actual data values in the blocks, rather than just the type name and locations. We should compare the data values within each block to determine if they are equal across the two BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on actual data values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the data values in each block rather than just their types and locations, this corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
