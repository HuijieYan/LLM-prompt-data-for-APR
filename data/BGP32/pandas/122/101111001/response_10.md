### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances by their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal. The test fails with an assertion error.
2. The function compares the axes of `self` and `other`, then consolidates the data to compare the blocks. Sorting is done based on the block type and location to handle unconsolidated blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the test expects the `equals` function to return `False` but gets `True`, leading to an assertion error. The runtime values show that the ordering in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists is incorrect, causing the equality check to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on the criteria defined in the `canonicalize` function. This will align the block order and allow for a proper comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly sorts the blocks for comparison based on block type and location. It should resolve the failing test case.
