### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the comparison between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` within the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function fails due to an issue in the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `True` instead of `False`, which leads to the assertion failure.

The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks in a non-consolidated form by directly using the `==` operator between the blocks. This comparison may not be valid for pandas DataFrames in certain cases, like comparing integer blocks with object blocks, and leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. Instead of performing a direct element-wise equality check between the blocks, we should compare them based on their content. One way to achieve this is by checking if the blocks are equivalent by comparing their elements iteratively.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks and comparing each pair individually within the corrected version, we can ensure a more accurate and robust comparison, fixing the bug. This version should now pass the failing test case.
