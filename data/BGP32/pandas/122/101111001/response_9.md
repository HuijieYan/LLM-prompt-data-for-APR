### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values, but the comparison function `block.equals(oblock)` afterward may fail if the blocks have different types or if blocks are at different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic within the `equals` function. Instead of just relying on sorting and comparing the blocks directly, we can enhance the comparison logic to properly handle different types and locations of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        # Check if the blocks can be compared
        if self.blocks.keys() != other.blocks.keys():
            return False

        for block_key in self.blocks.keys():
            if block_key in other.blocks and not self.blocks[block_key].equals(other.blocks[block_key]):
                return False
        
        return True
``` 

By updating the `equals` function to compare block keys first and then ensure that corresponding blocks are equal, we have addressed the underlying issue causing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test scenario.
