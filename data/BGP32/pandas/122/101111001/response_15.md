### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class where the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`) is incorrect. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This error is due to the incorrect canonicalization of blocks before comparison.

The comparison issue arises from the sorting and canonicalization of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block's data type name and manager locations. However, the manager locations are not compared correctly, leading to the mismatch in results and the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the canonicalization of blocks is done correctly by incorporating both the data type name and the manager locations for a fair comparison between blocks of different types. By correctly sorting the blocks based on these attributes, the `equals` function will be able to accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to also consider the manager locations of the blocks, the `equals` function will now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.
