### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple containing the block's dtype name and the result of converting `block.mgr_locs.as_array` to a list. The issue is that `block.mgr_locs.as_array` is of type `BlockPlacement` which does not have a `as_array` attribute, leading to an AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to correctly extract the required information from the block. We need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to handle the `BlockPlacement` object appropriately by using its properties/methods correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes[0], block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to extract the dtype from the block and use the `mgr_locs` directly without converting it to a list. This modification ensures that the bug causing the AttributeError is fixed.
