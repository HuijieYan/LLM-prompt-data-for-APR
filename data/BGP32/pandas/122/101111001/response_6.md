### Identified Bug:
The bug in the provided function arises from the ordering of blocks in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, but due to the order in which the blocks are added to the DataFrames, they end up in a different order causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks consistently in both DataFrames before comparing them. We will sort the blocks based on the column names to ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by index values
    self_blocks = self.blocks.values()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.values()
    
    self_columns = [b.mgr_locs.blocks[0] for b in self_blocks]
    other_columns = [b.mgr_locs.blocks[0] for b in other_blocks]
    
    self_sorted_blocks = [block for _, block in sorted(zip(self_columns, self_blocks))]
    other_sorted_blocks = [block for _, block in sorted(zip(other_columns, other_blocks))]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on column names before comparing them, we ensure that the order is consistent and the `equals` function will return the correct result.
