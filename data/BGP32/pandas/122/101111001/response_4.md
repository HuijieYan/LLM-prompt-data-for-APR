### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `equals` is caused by the incorrect comparison between two DataFrames (`self` and `other`). The function mistakenly sorts the blocks within the DataFrames based on the data type and locations which leads to the incorrect equality check. This sorting mix-up results in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the DataFrames directly without sorting based on dtype and locations. We can achieve this by iterating over the blocks of each DataFrame and comparing them individually.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

After using this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
