### Potential Error Location
The bug in the provided `equals` function seems to be related to sorting the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute. The comparison between blocks is failing due to a mismatch in the order of block sorting.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes for sorting.
2. If the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have different orders after sorting, the comparison between them will fail, leading to the incorrect equality check.
3. The failing test reveals that the actual assertion compares `True is False`, indicating that the equality check is incorrect due to block ordering mismatches.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Instead of solely relying on the block ordering from sorting, reevaluate the equality criteria between blocks.
2. Adapt the equality comparison between blocks to consider their actual content rather than just their sorting order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape or block1.dtypes != block2.dtypes:
            return False
        return block1.values == block2.values

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equality comparison now focuses on the actual content (shape, dtype, and values) of the blocks rather than relying on the block ordering after sorting. This should address the issue identified in the failing test.
