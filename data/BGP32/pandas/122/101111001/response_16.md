### Analysis
The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two data frames `df1` and `df2` for equality, and it correctly expects them to be unequal. The error message indicates that the equality check returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.

From the runtime values and types of variables provided, it can be seen that both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain two blocks each (an `IntBlock` and an `ObjectBlock`). However, due to the sorting logic using `canonicalize`, the blocks are sorted by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` before the equality check. This sorting step assumes that the blocks are comparable just based on these two criteria.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which only considers the `dtype.name` of the block and its locations (`mgr_locs`). For DataFrame blocks, this may not be sufficient to determine equality accurately. In the given case, the canonicalization does not account for the actual data stored in the blocks leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should consider the actual values stored in the blocks to determine equality accurately. One way to achieve this is to include the block's data values in the canonicalization process. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating `block.values.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison process will consider the actual data values of the blocks. This modification ensures that the equality check for DataFrames correctly compares the content of the blocks, resolving the issue in the failing test.
