### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not properly comparing two DataFrames for equality. In the failing test provided, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with swapped values in columns. The `equals` function should return `False` in this case since the DataFrames are not equal.

However, the buggy implementation of `equals` function fails to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames due to a sorting issue. It incorrectly sorts the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` rather than considering block values which leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the way blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` function. Instead of sorting blocks based on their `dtype.name`, we should consider sorting them based on their actual values.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order based on values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two DataFrames and pass the failing test provided.
