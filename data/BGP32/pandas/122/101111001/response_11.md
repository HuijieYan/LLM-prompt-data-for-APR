### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns ('a', 'b') but with values in a different order. It expects the `equals` function to return `False`.

### Issues
1. The `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects by sorting them based on a tuple combining the block type name and the `mgr_locs`. This sorting can lead to incorrect results when the blocks have different content but similar types and `mgr_locs`.
2. The comparison logic is flawed and does not account for potential differences in the block content, instead relying on block order and type.

### Proposed Fix
Modify the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of the sorted order by block type and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        # Compare each block content directly
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

After making these changes, re-run the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test to confirm that the corrected function passes the test.
