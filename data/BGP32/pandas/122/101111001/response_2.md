### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. However, the bug lies in the sorting mechanism within the function. The function sorts the blocks of each `BlockManager` using the `canonicalize` function, which is defined to create a tuple with the block's dtype and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises because `mgr_locs` is of type `BlockPlacement` and cannot be directly converted to a list for comparison.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to convert `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which results in an AttributeError.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to handle `mgr_locs` properly. Since `mgr_locs` is a `BlockPlacement` object, we should serialize it in a way that allows proper comparison. We can achieve this by updating the `canonicalize` function to serialize `mgr_locs` appropriately without relying on `as_array.tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexers.values()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
