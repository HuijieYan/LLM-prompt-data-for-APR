### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function aims to compare two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal based on multiple conditions like axes, blocks, etc.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different data values and then checks if `df1` equals `df2`. The expected result is `False` since the DataFrames are not equal.

The error occurs due to incorrect DataFrame equality comparison in the buggy function. The function sorts the blocks in the `BlockManager` before comparing them, with the intention to handle unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical data). However, the comparison logic is not correctly handling the distinct DataFrame content.

### Bug
The bug lies in the sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the blocks for comparison. It sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, assuming it's a sufficient condition for comparison. But this approach fails when the DataFrames contain different data types or values but in the same order.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the equality comparison logic to correctly handle DataFrames with different content. This involves comparing the actual data values in the blocks rather than relying solely on the sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all((block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)))
```

In the corrected version, we compare the blocks directly without sorting them first. This change ensures the comparison is based on the actual content rather than just the block order. This modification correctly handles DataFrames with different content as intended.
