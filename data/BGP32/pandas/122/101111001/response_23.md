### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and block content. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two data frames `df1` and `df2` with columns having different data types. The comparison fails because the buggy implementation doesn't handle this case correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from using the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their data types and locations. However, when comparing data frames with columns of different data types (integers and strings), the sorting based on data types causes the comparison to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting blocks based on data types, we can sort them based on block locations and then compare them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_locs(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()

    self_block_locs = list(map(get_block_locs, self.blocks))
    other_block_locs = list(map(get_block_locs, other.blocks))

    matching_blocks = 0
    for loc in self_block_locs:
        if loc in other_block_locs:
            matching_blocks += 1

    return matching_blocks == len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks)
```

By modifying the comparison to check for matching block locations instead of sorting based on data types, the corrected implementation should now handle the comparison correctly, passing the failing test.
