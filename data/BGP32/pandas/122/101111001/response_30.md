### Bug Analysis
In the failing test case, we have two dataframes `df1` and `df2` that are not equal. When the `equals()` method is called on `df1` with `df2` as the argument, the method should return False but instead returns True, leading to the assertion error.

Looking at the buggy code, the comparison logic involves checking the equality of axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. Specifically, the issue lies in the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting is not handling the ordering correctly, resulting in the incorrect comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should make sure that the `canonicalize` function used for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considers the proper attributes to differentiate the blocks.

The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Fixed equals function in BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtypes), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By using the corrected `canonicalize` function based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, we ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly, resolving the bug.
