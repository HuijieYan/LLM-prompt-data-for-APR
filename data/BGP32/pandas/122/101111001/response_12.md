### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function is sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks using the block's data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the bug arises due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks as the type `tuple` is not directly comparable with `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock` types.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple with the data type name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This `tuple` creation does not directly correspond to the block types like `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock`.
  
2. The incorrect comparison arises when trying to compare `block.equals(oblock)` where the `block` and `oblock` have different types, causing the failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types correctly and ensure that we compare blocks of the same type.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda oblock: (type(oblock), oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on the block type and `mgr_locs` information, ensuring that blocks of the same type are compared correctly, resolving the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
