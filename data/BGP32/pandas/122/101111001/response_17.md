### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the fact that the comparison between the two blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) is not aligned correctly. The function is currently sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and location, but the blocks themselves are not being compared correctly. In the failing test case, the two data frames `df1` and `df2` have the same column names but different values, leading to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the blocks is based on the values they contain, rather than just their dtype and location. This can be achieved by comparing the data within each block as part of the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to compare individual blocks
    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        if block.shape != oblock.shape:
            return False
        return block.values.equals(oblock.values)

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `block_equals` function to compare the values within each block, we ensure that the equality check in the `equals` function takes into account the actual data in each block, leading to correct results for comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances as intended.
