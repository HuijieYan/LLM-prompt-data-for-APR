### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from how the blocks are being sorted before comparing them with another `BlockManager` instance. The bug causes the comparison to fail for DataFrames that should be considered equal. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that the comparison incorrectly evaluates to `True`.

The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by data type and manager locations. Since the dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array` together should uniquely identify a block, the sorting is crucial. However, the issue arises from the incorrect usage of `as_array` in the `canonicalize` function. The method `as_array` is being called directly on `mgr_locs` without the proper syntax, leading to an error and incorrect sorting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function should correctly access the `as_array` attribute. This involves ensuring that `mgr_locs` is an instance of `BlockPlacement` and calling `as_array` properly before using it to sort the blocks. By addressing this issue, the sorting will be done correctly, allowing for accurate comparison between `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Corrected the method call

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this correction, the comparison process in the `equals` function should now correctly operate, passing the failing test case provided.
