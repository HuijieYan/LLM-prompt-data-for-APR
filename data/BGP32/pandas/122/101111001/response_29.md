### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects, specifically comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

1. The function starts by comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` objects. This part seems to be correctly implemented.
2. It then consolidates both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects in place, which might be unnecessary for the equality check.
3. The bug seems to occur when sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` objects using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple with the block's name and its `mgr_locs` as a list, but there are issues in how these are handled.
4. During the comparison of the blocks in the sorted order, the bug prevents the correct comparison of corresponding blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `BlockManager` class `equals` function:
1. Remove the unnecessary in-place consolidation of both `self` and `other` objects.
2. Correct the sorting mechanism for blocks. Instead of using `as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, utilize `block.mgr_locs` directly for comparison.
3. Ensure that the comparison of blocks happens after correct sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the sorting mechanism and the comparison of blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
