### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. Looking at the runtime values:
   - The axes of both `self` and `other` are the same.
   - The blocks have different locations but are the same type.
   - The `equals` function does not properly handle the case where blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
4. The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, but the latter is not taking the block's position into account.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the position of the block.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.__repr__())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's position in addition to dtype, the corrected version should now properly handle cases where blocks have the same type but different locations.
