### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes, blocks, and contents are equal. However, the bug causes the comparison to return `True` incorrectly when the blocks have the same data but different locations. This issue arises when consolidating the blocks and then comparing them. The `equals` method relies on sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to identify identical blocks. If the blocks have the same data but different locations, they are considered different blocks.

The failing test case provides DataFrames with the same data but in a different order, causing the `equals` method to wrongly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` when sorting the blocks. This change ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only use `block.dtype.name`, the corrected version ensures that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their locations. This fix addresses the incorrect comparison behavior highlighted in the failing test and described in the GitHub issue.
