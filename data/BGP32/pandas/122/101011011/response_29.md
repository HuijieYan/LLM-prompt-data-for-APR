### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects have the same length. If not, it returns `False`.
3. It then proceeds to check if all corresponding axes are equal using a generator expression, if not, it returns `False`.
4. The function then consolidates the blocks of both objects in place.
5. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks of the two objects to determine their equality.

### Error Analysis
1. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames that have the same columns but in a different order.
2. The expected result is for the `equals` function to return `False` in this case.
3. The failing test triggers an assertion error where the actual result is `True` instead of `False`.
4. The issue arises because the sorting of blocks is done based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, which is not considering the block order correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Since the issue occurs due to blocks not being sorted correctly, we need to modify the sorting criteria to include the block content itself to ensure the correct ordering.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content first, then dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content in addition to the dtype and mgr_locs, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly, and the function should now return the expected result for the failing test.
