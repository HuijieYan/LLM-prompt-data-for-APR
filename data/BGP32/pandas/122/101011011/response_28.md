### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their attributes.
2. The error message indicates that for a specific test case, the comparison `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion failure.
3. In the buggy function, the comparison logic seems correct, but the issue might be related to the way the blocks are sorted and compared.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that there is a bug in the `equals` method where it incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their type name and manager locations in the `canonicalize` function. If blocks have identical content but different locations, they should not be considered equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to take into account the exact content of the blocks rather than just their type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, we bypass the problematic sorting step based on block characteristics and directly compare the blocks' content for equality. This should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` method performs the intended comparison.
