### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The bug is likely arising due to the sorting of blocks before comparison. The sorting is based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If the blocks have the same data type and different locations, they may be sorted differently, causing incorrect equality comparison.
3. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, the function is erroneously returning `True` due to the incorrect comparison logic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where blocks have identical types but different locations correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of directly sorting blocks, we need to compare blocks one by one and ensure that they are equal despite the location differences.
2. We can potentially modify the `equals` function to check for identical data types first and then compare the blocks for equality while ignoring the location differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
            return False
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now iterates through blocks one by one, checking if the blocks have the same data type before comparing them for equality. This approach should address the issue raised in the failing GitHub test and resolve the bug.
