### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` class based on their type name and memory locations. The comparison logic with `canonicalize` function fails to correctly identify differences in the blocks when the blocks have swapped positions in the DataFrames. This leads to incorrect comparisons and results in `equals` function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting blocks based on their type name and memory locations, we should consider the order of the block positions within the DataFrame. By ensuring that we correctly compare blocks based on their positions, we can accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared based on their actual positions within the DataFrame rather than relying on their type name and memory locations.
