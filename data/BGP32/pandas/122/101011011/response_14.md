### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It checks if the axes of the two instances are equal and then compares the blocks within the instances. The issue arises when sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a canonicalization function.
2. The failing test case provides DataFrames with identical values but in different orientations. The test is expected to return `False` because the DataFrames are not equal.
3. The bug occurs because the canonicalization of blocks is not considering the order of blocks within the data structures, leading to incorrect comparisons. This results in the `equals` function mistakenly returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider the order of the blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(blocks):
            return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), idx) for idx, block in enumerate(blocks)]

        self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

        self_blocks.sort()
        other_blocks.sort()

        return all(
            block.equals(other.blocks[oblock_idx]) for (_, _, oblock_idx), block in self_blocks
        )
```

By sorting the blocks after canonicalization and considering the indexes of each block, we can ensure that the comparison accounts for the order of blocks within the data structures. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected.
