### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`. However, in the given runtime values, the `mgr_locs` of the `block` and `oblock` are not consistent due to the different block locations. This inconsistency leads to incorrect ordering and affects the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks are ordered consistently based on their content rather than just their locations. One way to achieve this is by using a combination of the block's data type name and the actual block values to define the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a key for sorting blocks based on dtype name and actual block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    # Sort the blocks based on the defined key
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their data type name and actual values, we ensure a consistent order regardless of block locations. This correction should address the issue raised in the failing test and also resolve the problem reported on GitHub.
