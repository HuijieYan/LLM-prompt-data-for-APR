### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes, blocks, and column data, but the comparison logic is flawed.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it evaluates to `True is False`.
- The runtime values show that the two `BlockManager` objects have the same axes but different block orders.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function tries to compare blocks in different orders, resulting in a false positive when checking equality.
- The sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function may not be enough to ensure correct comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and in the correct order regardless of their initial order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [block.copy() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.copy() for block in other.blocks]
    
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the function will ensure that the blocks are compared in a sorted order to avoid false positives in the equality check. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
