### Error Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue originates from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is incorrect because it sorts the blocks based on their data types and locations; however, it doesn't consider the order of blocks within the lists. This results in a false-positive comparison, leading to the test failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison of blocks should consider both the content and the order of blocks within the lists. Sorting based on data types and locations alone is insufficient.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function needs to be refined to consider both the type name and the order of block data. We can achieve this by including the block's index position as a sorting criterion.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block index for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the index of blocks during sorting in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison accounts for both the type/name of the block and its position within the list. This correction allows for an accurate comparison of blocks in the `equals` method.
