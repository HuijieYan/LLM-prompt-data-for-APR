### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects. It checks the equality of their axes, consolidates them in place, and then compares the number of blocks. After that, it tries to canonicalize the blocks and sort them using a custom key function `canonicalize`.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison done by the `equals` function returns `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The bug likely arises because of how the function canonicalizes and sorts the blocks. The custom key function `canonicalize` may not be properly handling different block locations, causing the equality check to fail.
5. To fix the bug, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function to properly account for different block locations so that identical blocks are not mistakenly marked as different.
6. The corrected version of the `equals` function should handle block locations correctly and sort the blocks accordingly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.values) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block1 == block2 for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is updated to extract block values instead of locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should make the `equals` function behave as expected.
