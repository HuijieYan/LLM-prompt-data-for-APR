### Identifying the Issue
From the error message and the runtime values of the variables, it is clear that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames. The issue seems to be with the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The key problem arises from comparing blocks that are identical but in different locations, causing the comparison to fail.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks that have the same data but are in different locations. The sorting of blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` might not be sufficient to distinguish blocks with similar data but different locations. This leads to incorrect results in some cases where the DataFrames should be considered unequal due to block location differences.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to consider both the data and the block locations. One approach could involve creating a separate comparison logic incorporating both aspects to ensure that similar blocks in different locations are detected as unequal. Additionally, we need to refactor the comparison process to handle these scenarios more effectively.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def sort_key(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `sort_key` function to consider both the `block.values` and `block.mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks. This change ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are now properly distinguished during the comparison process, addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.

By updating the comparison logic to handle block locations effectively, the `equals` function should now yield the expected results and pass the failing tests.
