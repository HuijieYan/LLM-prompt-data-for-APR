### Identified Issue:
The issue arises in the `equals` function where the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is incorrect due to a misorder in the sorting process. This leads to inconsistency in comparing the blocks, resulting in the function returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and location. 
2. The issue is in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is utilized, which can misplace the blocks during the sorting process.
3. Due to this misplaced sorting, the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` yields incorrect results, causing the function to return `True` falsely.

### Fix Strategy:
The `canonicalize` function should be updated to use more precise parameters for sorting the blocks. It should ensure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,  # Sort based on the class type
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,  # Sort based on the block's location index
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By refining the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function, the correct comparison and ordering of blocks will be achieved, and the function will now return the expected `False` for cases where the blocks are not equal.
