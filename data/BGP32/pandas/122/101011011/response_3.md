### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The error message indicates that the equality check between two DataFrames fails when the columns' order is different, returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug is caused by:
   - The current implementation of the `equals` method does not properly handle the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames when their order is different.
   - The sorting of blocks based on characteristics such as dtype and mgr_locs can lead to incorrect comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` method to properly handle the comparison of blocks even if their order varies within the DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Consider all blocks within the DataFrames for comparison, regardless of their order.
2. Include logic to handle scenarios where the columns' order differs between the DataFrames.
3. Directly compare corresponding blocks between the two DataFrames instead of relying on sorting by characteristics that may not be unique identifiers.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare blocks directly without sorting on dtype and mgr_locs
        self_blocks_set = set(self.blocks)
        other_blocks_set = set(other.blocks)

        # If the number of unique blocks differs, the DataFrames are not equal
        if len(self_blocks_set) != len(other_blocks_set):
            return False

        # Check if corresponding blocks in both DataFrames are equal
        for self_block in self_blocks_set:
            corresponding_block = next((other_block for other_block in other_blocks_set if self_block.equals(other_block)), None)
            if corresponding_block is None:
                return False

        return True
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `equals` method, the bug causing incorrect comparison results in DataFrames with differing column orders should be fixed.
