### Identified Issue:
The issue arises from the comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations but identical content.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function compares the blocks in DataFrames for equality. It performs the sorting of the blocks based on types and locations, leading to incorrect results when identical blocks exist in different locations.
2. Due to the sorting based on types and locations, identical blocks with different locations are mistakenly considered unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks based on locations should not be done, as it causes identical blocks in different locations to be considered unequal. Instead, focus on comparing the blocks directly based on their content.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting based on locations in the `canonicalize` function, and directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, the bug causing incorrect equality comparison for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations should be resolved.
