### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.

The function goes through multiple steps to compare the two `BlockManager` instances:

1. It compares the length of `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
2. It then checks if each pair of axes in `self.axes` and `other.axes` are equal.
3. It consolidates the data within `self` and `other`.
4. It compares the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
5. It sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists based on a canonicalized representation of each block.
6. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks and compares each pair.

### Identifying potential error locations

The error could be occurring due to how the `canonicalize` function is defined and used to sort the blocks for comparison. If the sorting logic does not result in the blocks being ordered correctly for comparison, it could lead to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Cause of the bug

The `canonicalize` function is using `block.dtype.name` as part of the tuple for sorting. This sorting key may not be suitable if the blocks have different data types or if `dtype.name` is not unique for blocks with different data. This could result in blocks being sorted in an incorrect order for comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting key provided by `canonicalize` results in a consistent and correct order for the blocks. It might be more reliable to include additional information in the sorting key to differentiate blocks if `dtype.name` alone is not sufficient.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting key to differentiate blocks by data type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a sorting key that includes the block's data type, `dtype.name`, and location, the function should now correctly sort the blocks for comparison and return the expected result for the failing test.
