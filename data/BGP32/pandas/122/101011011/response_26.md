### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, suggesting that the function is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. From the runtime values provided, the function compares the axes of `self` and `other` first, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on a canonicalize function, and finally compares the blocks.
4. The bug seems to be in the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which may not be correctly handling the dtype and locations.
5. The GitHub issue confirms this bug, where identical blocks with different locations are wrongly considered equal.

### Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly consider the type name and locations of the blocks while sorting.
2. To address the bug, correct the `canonicalize` function to include both dtype name and the locations of the blocks.
3. Update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block locations along with dtype name.
4. This adjustment should ensure that even identical blocks with different locations are distinguished during comparison.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the `canonicalize` function and , the corrected version should now properly handle situations where identical blocks differ in locations. This update will resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
