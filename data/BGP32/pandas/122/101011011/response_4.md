### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and individual block equality using the `equals` method.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
3. From the runtime values provided, we can see that the input parameters `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain tuples of different blocks with mismatched locations.
4. The bug occurs because the function compares the blocks in the same order without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks by a canonical representation that includes both the type and location of the blocks before comparing them.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes the block type and locations before performing the equality comparison.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report by ensuring that blocks with identical values but differing locations are correctly identified as not equal.
