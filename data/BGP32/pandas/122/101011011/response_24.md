### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks axes, consolidates in place, and then iterates over blocks for comparison.
4. The buggy behavior is caused by comparing blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which are not sufficient for determining equality in certain cases, resulting in incorrect comparison outcomes.
5. The bug leads to the incorrect assertion failure in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic between blocks is reliable and accurate for determining equality.
2. It's essential to identify a better approach for comparing blocks that guarantees correct results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated equals method in BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return self.blocks == other.blocks  # Directly compare blocks for equality
```

The corrected version directly compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples for equality, which ensures a more robust and accurate comparison. This approach should address the bug and make the `equals` method return the correct results.
