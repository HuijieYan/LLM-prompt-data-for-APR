### Identification of Potential Bug Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function seems to be flawed, specifically in how it handles the comparison between blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks may not be accurately capturing the criteria for comparison.
3. There might be issues with the sorting and comparison process of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Explanation of Bug Cause:
1. The error message indicates that a comparison equality check between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
2. The current logic in the `equals` function first checks the axis equality, then consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other`, and finally compares the sorted blocks. 
3. The incorrect behavior occurs during the sorting process of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` where the blocks might not be sorted accurately based on the criteria provided by the `canonicalize` function.
4. This incorrect sorting results in a misjudgment in the final equality comparison, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function accurately represents the criteria for sorting blocks.
2. Modify the sorting approach for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to guarantee a consistent and correct comparison between blocks.
3. Keep track of the actual structure and content of the blocks to ensure a valid comparison in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring the correct sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare the blocks in `self` and `other`, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
