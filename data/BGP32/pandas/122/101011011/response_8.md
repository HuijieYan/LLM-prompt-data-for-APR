### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` method. The issue is with how the block dtype is being accessed without considering the block type correctly. The `canonicalize` function is currently assuming that all blocks have a `dtype` attribute, which is not true for all types of blocks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the correct handling of different block types. We should check the block type before accessing the `dtype` attribute to ensure we are handling it correctly for each block type.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, ExtensionBlock):
            return block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        elif isinstance(block, FloatBlock):
            return block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        else:
            return None
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added checks within the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types correctly. This modification ensures that the `dtype` attribute is accessed appropriately for each block type, resolving the bug and making the `equals` method work as expected.
