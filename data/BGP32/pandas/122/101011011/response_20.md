### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The bug is triggered when comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` function. In this case, the two DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations, which should result in `equals` returning `False`. However, due to a flaw in the `equals` implementation, the comparison results in `True`, which is incorrect behavior.

The key problematic part of the code is the way blocks are compared. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks are equal logically but have different `mgr_locs` instances, they will be considered not equal, which is incorrect.

### Potential Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the logical equality of the blocks, disregarding differences in the `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then block contents
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, instead of using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, we compare blocks based on their logical contents by directly using the `block` instance itself. This change ensures that blocks with the same logical content are considered equal even if their locations differ.

This corrected version should resolve the bug described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `equals` function behaves correctly when dealing with DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
