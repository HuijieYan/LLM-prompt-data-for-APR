### Explanation of the Bug

The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function is implemented incorrectly. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects for comparison. The bug occurs when `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is called in the `canonicalize` function to generate a key for sorting. This leads to an AttributeError because `block.mgr_locs` does not have an attribute `as_array`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to utilize the existing `block.mgr_locs` attribute without calling `as_array.tolist()`. Instead, we can directly use the `block.mgr_locs` attribute. This approach will prevent the AttributeError and ensure correct comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this correction, the `canonicalize` function will use `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` directly for comparison, avoiding the AttributeError that occurred previously.

This updated version should now resolve the bug and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
