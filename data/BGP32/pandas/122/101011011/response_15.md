### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The failing test indicates that the comparison is not accurate for DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations. The test case provides DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have identical blocks but in a different order.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic may not be handling the case where the blocks are identical but their locations are different.
2. The sorting of blocks done before comparison may ignore block locations.
3. The implementation of the `canonicalize` function could be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. The sorting based on `canonicalize` function does not incorporate block locations, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, amend the `canonicalize` function to include block locations while generating a tuple for comparison. This change would ensure that the equality check considers both block contents and their locations.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include block locations in the tuple
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block locations in the comparison tuples generated by the `canonicalize` function. Consequently, identical blocks with different block locations will be accurately identified as unequal.
