### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates that the test case `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
3. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns but different data types in different positions.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares blocks after they have been sorted based on their dtypes and `mgr_locs`.
5. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a tuple for sorting, but it seems to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle different data types in different positions within the blocks. This results in the function incorrectly determining that the two `BlockManager` instances are equal when they are not.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and the data of the block while sorting.
2. Update the comparison logic to account for different data types in different positions within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Modified to consider dtype.name and data
        return (block.dtype.name, block.to_values().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By fixing the `canonicalize` function to take into account both dtype names and block values for sorting, the `equals` function should now correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
