### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The error message shows that the test case `df1.equals(df2)` is failing with an incorrect assertion.
3. The buggy function sorts and compares blocks within the `BlockManager` instances to check for equality. The comparison seems to fail due to the block order differing between the two instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared accurately by handling the order of blocks properly.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem, where the expected output is `False` but the function currently returns `True` incorrectly.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks while considering block order.
2. Ensure that the sorting mechanism used to match the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is consistent and properly accounts for block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.names[0], block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```  

By updating the comparison logic and block sorting mechanism, the corrected version should handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
