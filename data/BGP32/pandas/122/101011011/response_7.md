### Bug Explanation:
In the provided buggy function, the `canonicalize` function sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the keys generated by the `canonicalize` function which combines the block's data type and its locations. The bug occurs because the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is generating a list of locations that is not hashable, causing the sorted function to throw an error. This error then leads to incorrect sorting, resulting in `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to create hashable keys. One way to achieve this is by converting the list of block locations to a tuple, which is hashable, generating a key that can be used for sorting without errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By converting the list of block locations to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function, the bug causing `df1.equals(df2)` to return `True` incorrectly should be resolved. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
