### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test is checking for the equality of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The test expects the result to be `False`, but due to a bug in the `equals` method, it returns `True`.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class, leading to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function accounts for both the type of block and its location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.to_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Corrected Version:
The above corrected version of the `equals` function modifies the way blocks are compared. It now uses the block type and its location to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly considered equal. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
