### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` demonstrates the issue where the `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with different values.
3. The issue reported on GitHub (`BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations`) also aligns with the failing test case.
4. The bug is caused by not comparing the actual values in the blocks of the DataFrames while checking for equality in the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects. The comparison is based on the `equals` method of the blocks but should actually compare the data within the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to compare the actual block values instead of just checking if the blocks are equal objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by values
    self_blocks = [b.values for b in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [b.values for b in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the block values directly using `np.array_equal`, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly checks for equality based on the data in the blocks rather than just the object references.
