### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class which is a core internal data structure in pandas.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the `equals` method of a DataFrame.
- The GitHub issue reports that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the axes of two BlockManager objects.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks based on dtype and locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not handle the case where blocks are identical but located in different locations properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare block data and order by dtype
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version above includes sorting the blocks based on the actual data stored within them rather than their locations.

Now, running the failing test should pass successfully.
