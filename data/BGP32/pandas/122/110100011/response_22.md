### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is testing the `equals` method on two `DataFrame` objects.
3. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks have identical data but different locations, which goes against the expected behavior of returning `False`.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks before comparing them for equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the sorting of blocks within the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method. The bug causes the comparison to return `True` even when the blocks have identical data but different locations due to sorting by type name and manager locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the sorting strategy within the `equals` method to ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks. We should sort the blocks based on data content rather than their type names and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._data.items()
    other_blocks = other._data.items()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the items in the internal data structure, we can accurately check for block equality without being affected by the locations of the blocks. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
