### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The `equals()` function checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` instances are equal.
3. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that `DataFrame.equals()` returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. This bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances that have the same content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals()` function to compare the content of blocks rather than their locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on their content while comparing.
3. Update the `equals()` function to sort and compare blocks based on content to ensure correct equality comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content to compare
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the `equals()` function will correctly compare the content of blocks within `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations return `False` when compared.
