### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The buggy function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The function fails to correctly compare blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, leading to incorrect results.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames that are not equal, but the `equals` function returns True incorrectly.

### Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length without considering the equality of axes.
2. Sorting of blocks without considering the actual content of the blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug occurs due to the function not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. The sorting of blocks based on dtype name and locations causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered different, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that axes length is taken into consideration after checking if the axes themselves are equal.
2. Modify the sorting mechanism for blocks to consider block content instead of just dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def are_blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.get_blocks_state(mgr_locs=True).equals(block2.get_blocks_state(mgr_locs=True))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block._block_type)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block._block_type)

    return all(are_blocks_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
This corrected version of the `equals` function fixes the comparison logic for blocks and ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified, leading to the function returning the expected results.

### After applying this fix, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
