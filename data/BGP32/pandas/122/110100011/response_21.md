### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames using the `equals` method, which is expected to return `False` when comparing DataFrames with differently ordered columns.
3. The issue reported on GitHub describes the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method, where it wrongly returns `True` even when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks is considered during the comparison of two DataFrames.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises because it doesn't consider the order of blocks when comparing DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but it doesn't guarantee that the order of blocks in `self` and `other` will be the same when performing the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks in `self` and `other` remains the same during comparison. We can achieve this by adding an extra check to compare blocks based on their original order, not just after sorting them.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks_orig_order = self.blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_orig_order, other_blocks)
    )
```

By maintaining the `self_blocks_orig_order` and comparing blocks based on their original order, we ensure that the bug related to the incorrect comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations is addressed.
