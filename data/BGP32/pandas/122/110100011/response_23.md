### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` is checking if `df1` does not equal `df2`.
3. The GitHub issue reports that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to faulty comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to handle comparisons of identical blocks with different locations. We can achieve this by updating the comparisons of blocks based on their type names and manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._ftype.note, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if isinstance(oblock, block.__class__) else False
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block type names and manager locations, and modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` function, we can now properly handle comparisons of identical blocks with different locations. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
