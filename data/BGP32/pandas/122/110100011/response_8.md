### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal. The bug seems to be related to sorting the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` instances before comparing them.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function, which sorts them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
2. Comparing the sorted blocks in a one-to-one manner which may cause issues if the order is different.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from the fact that when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the blocks are being sorted based on a canonicalize function that includes `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This could lead to a scenario where blocks with the same content but in different locations are considered unequal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks based on their content rather than a mixture of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. We should also ensure that the comparison is not dependent on the order of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # ignore order of blocks with the same content when checking equality
    def get_block_content(block):
        return block.get_values()

    self_contents = sorted([get_block_content(block) for block in self.blocks])
    other_contents = sorted([get_block_content(block) for block in other.blocks])

    return self_contents == other_contents
```

### Changes Made:
1. I replaced the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` with sorting based on the content of the blocks themselves.
2. I created a `get_block_content` function to extract the content of each block for comparison.
3. I then checked if the sorted content of `self.blocks` is equal to the sorted content of `other.blocks` to determine equality.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` if their content is the same (ignoring the block order) and `False` otherwise.
