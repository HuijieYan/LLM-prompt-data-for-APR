### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library is responsible for checking the equality of two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file checks if two DataFrames with different data are considered equal using the `equals` method, and it expects the test to fail by returning `False`.
3. The GitHub issue highlighted a bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bugs:
1. The bug may occur when comparing two instances of `BlockManager` where the blocks are identical but have different locations.
2. The current implementation of the `equals` method does not handle the case of blocks with the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to properly handle the case of blocks with identical data but different locations. We can achieve this by first checking if the blocks have the same data and then comparing their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all blocks have the same data and locations
    match = all(
        block1.equals(block2) and np.all(block1.mgr_locs == block2.mgr_locs)
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
    return match
```

The corrected version of the `equals` method now properly handles the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the DataFrames are correctly identified as not equal when the data is in the same order but the locations differ. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
