### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function `equals` is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.
4. The bug is related to the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` before comparison.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` verifies the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function.
6. The GitHub issue describes the incorrect behavior and the expected output.
7. The bug occurs because the function does not handle blocks with different locations properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for better comparison.
2. Sort blocks based on `dtype.name` and block locations before comparison.
3. Update the `equals` function logic to correctly compare blocks.
4. Ensure that the function returns `False` if the blocks have different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations and sorting blocks based on this combined key before comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks exist at different locations and return the expected output.
