### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing because it incorrectly expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` when the data in the two DataFrames are in a different order.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function does not handle the case where the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be in different orders but contain the same data.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` may not correctly handle cases where blocks have equivalent data but different metadata.

### Explanation of Bug:
- The issue arises when the `equals` function compares blocks in different order due to sorting based on `canonicalize`. This results in returning `False`, even if the blocks contain equivalent data.
- As a result, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test fails because it expects a `False` output when comparing two DataFrames with the same elements but in a different order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where blocks may be in different orders but contain the same data.
2. Ensure that the comparison considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just the block metadata.
3. Modify the sorting method to better handle equivalent data blocks but with different metadata distinctions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
        other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
        
        return all(
            np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data)
            for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
        )
```

After updating the `equals` function with the corrected version above, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
