### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, the `equals` function incorrectly returns True instead of False.
4. The cause of the bug lies in how the function handles the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the function compares blocks between two DataFrames. This comparison is implemented using the `equals` method, which is supposed to check the equality of blocks based on their content. However, it fails to account for the scenario where identical blocks exist in the DataFrames but with different locations (possibly due to reindexing or other operations).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. We should ensure that the sorting mechanism accounts for both the type name and the locations of the blocks to differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Combine type name and mgr_locs to differentiate identical blocks with different locations
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fixed version includes a modification in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks are sorted based on both the type name and the locations, which allows the `equals` function to correctly handle cases with identical blocks but different locations. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub.
