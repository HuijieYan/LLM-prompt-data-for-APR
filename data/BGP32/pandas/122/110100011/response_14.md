### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method and expects it to return False.
3. The GitHub issue reports a bug where calling `equals` on identical DataFrames with different block locations returns True instead of False.
4. The bug occurs due to comparing block locations rather than block contents in the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method arises from not considering the content of the blocks while comparing. The sorting of blocks based on block locations causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the block contents instead of block locations. Removing the sorting based on block locations will ensure that identical blocks are correctly deemed equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks based on locations and compares the block contents directly, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly compared.
