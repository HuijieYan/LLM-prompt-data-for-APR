### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which indicates a bug in the `equals` function.

### Bugs in the buggy function:
1. The `canonicalize` function is not correctly defined, causing incorrect ordering of blocks.
2. Due to incorrect ordering, the comparison between blocks is not accurate, leading to the `equals` method returning incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect ordering of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances while comparing them. This incorrect ordering results in blocks with identical data but different locations being considered as not equal, leading to the `equals` method returning `False` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are ordered correctly before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to properly determine the order of blocks based on their dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should return the expected result (`False`).
