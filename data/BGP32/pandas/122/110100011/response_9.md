### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method belonging to the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" is related to the bug in the `equals` function.
   
### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. The issue arises when comparing blocks that should be considered not equal due to having different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the current implementation of the `canonicalize` function. It doesn't take into account the actual locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons between blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block type name and the locations (mgr_locs) of the blocks to distinguish between blocks that may be identical but placed in different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction in place, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class should now properly handle the cases where blocks have different locations, fixing the bug and making the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
