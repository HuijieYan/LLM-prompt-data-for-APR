**Analysis:**
- The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal.
- The comparison is failing because in the case of identical blocks with different locations, the function is incorrectly returning `True`.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with similar data but swapped columns, and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
- The GitHub issue highlights this problem and expects the `equals` function to return `False` in such cases.
- The bug is related to the incorrect handling of identical blocks with different locations during comparison.

**Error location:**
- The error is occurring within the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison.
- The issue arises when the block locations are different, causing identical blocks to be erroneously marked as equal.

**Cause of the bug:**
- The `canonicalize` function incorrectly uses the block's `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to determine equality, causing blocks with different locations to be considered equal.
- Due to this incorrect logic, blocks with identical content but different locations are sorted as equal.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to exclude the block locations from the equality comparison.
- The `canonicalize` function should only consider the content (dtype) of the block for sorting.
- This change will ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not marked as equal during comparison.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # to ensure correct sorting for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function focuses on the content (dtype) of the blocks for comparison, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly distinguished.
