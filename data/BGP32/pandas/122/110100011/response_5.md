### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class within the `managers.py` file is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function is designed to check if the axes lengths are equal, compare the axes, consolidate the blocks, sort and canonicalize the blocks, and then check for equality.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
4. The fix should involve a more robust approach to comparing blocks, considering block locations. This can be achieved by modifying the way blocks are canonicalized and compared.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function's simplistic block comparison. When sorting and comparing the blocks, it does not take into account the actual order or locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect results. As a result, the function wrongly returns `True` when comparing `BlockManager` objects with identical content but different block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function in a way that takes into account the locations of the blocks. This can ensure that when comparing blocks, the comparison considers both the block content and their respective locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Updated Changes:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations by converting `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to `tuple(block.mgr_locs)`.
2. Used `tuple` for `block.mgr_locs` to standardize comparison of block locations.
3. Updated sorting and comparison of blocks based on the modified `canonicalize` function.

With these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now properly compare `BlockManager` objects considering both the block content and their respective locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behavior more accurate.
