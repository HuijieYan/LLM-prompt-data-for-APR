### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function inside the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the blocks for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame objects with different values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` function.
3. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle the scenario where identical blocks with different locations are present in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Before comparing the blocks for equality, we need to sort the blocks based on a canonical representation of the block to handle the scenario where identical blocks with different locations are present.
2. We will modify the `canonicalize` function to create a representation of the block based on its dtype name and locations.
3. Sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using this modified `canonicalize` function before comparing them for equality.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.values.data))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After fixing the bug in the `equals` function, rerunning the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
