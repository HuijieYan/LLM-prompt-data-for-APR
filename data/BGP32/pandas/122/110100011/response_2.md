### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The GitHub issue `BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations` describes the problem as `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `equals` function due to the way blocks are being compared. It is not correctly handling blocks with different locations but identical values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic inside the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. It fails to properly handle different block locations while comparing blocks for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` function to properly compare blocks with different locations. One way to address this issue is to compare the values within the blocks directly, rather than relying on the order of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks based on values instead of locations
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the values within the blocks instead of their locations, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies differences between the DataFrames. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
