### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with identical elements but different locations.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames with columns of different data types are not equal using the `equals` method, which is incorrect.
3. The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to a false positive result and causing the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for blocks with identical elements but different locations, ensuring that the comparison is accurate based on the actual content.

### Solution:
I suggest updating the `equals` function to directly compare the elements of the blocks instead of relying on their order in memory.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Existing code omitted for brevity

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
        return all(
            block.values.tostring() == oblock.values.tostring() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After implementing the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, the failing test should now pass as it correctly handles the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations.
