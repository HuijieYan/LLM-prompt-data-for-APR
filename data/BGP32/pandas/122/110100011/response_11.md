### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is responsible for checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then proceeds to compare their blocks. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks.
3. The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have identical data but are stored in different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function takes into account the location of the blocks as well.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` function. This function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, which is a list of the locations where each block is stored. However, the comparison should consider the actual content of the blocks, not just their type and location.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual data of the blocks for comparison. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the actual values of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected `equals` function will now properly compare the content of the blocks as well as their type and location. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
