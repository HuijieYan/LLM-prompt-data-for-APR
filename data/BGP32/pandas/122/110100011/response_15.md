### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a case where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which may cause identical blocks with different locations to be treated as equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on content rather than sorting them by dtype and location.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to return the actual content of the block (e.g., the whole block as a list) instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Compare the blocks directly without sorting them.
3. Update the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content instead of their dtype and location.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above changes, the `equals` function should now correctly handle cases where two `DataFrame` instances have identical blocks with different locations.
