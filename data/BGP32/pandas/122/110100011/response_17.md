### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is implemented in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different orders and expects `equals` method to return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue describes the scenario where `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. Even if the blocks are identical, since they may have different locations (unconsolidated blocks like Categorical), the comparison incorrectly returns `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the internal content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: str(b.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: str(b.values))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their internal content (`values`) rather than locations. This modification ensures that two blocks with identical content, but different locations, will be considered equal during the comparison.
