### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is a method of the `BlockManager` class which is responsible for comparing two instances of the class for equality.
2. The function is correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances, however, it fails to appropriately handle identical blocks with different locations.
3. The cause of the bug can be identified in the `canonicalize()` function within the `equals()` method which sorts the blocks based on the block type and manager locations. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be treated as unequal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize()` function to consider the content of the blocks for comparison, rather than the locations.
5. We should update the `equals()` method to properly compare the blocks based on their content, ensuring that even blocks with different locations but identical content are considered equal.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` method:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
This updated version compares the blocks based on their content and data type, ensuring that even if the locations are different, identical blocks are considered equal.

Now, with this fix, the provided failing test case should pass successfully.
