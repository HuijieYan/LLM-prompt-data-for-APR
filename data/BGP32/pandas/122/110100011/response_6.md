### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the `equals` function by creating two DataFrames with different values and asserting that they are not equal.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The issue occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on data type and manager locations, which may lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Sorting of blocks based on datatype and manager locations.
2. Comparison of blocks using the `equals` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks in a way that may not guarantee the correct comparison. If identical blocks have different locations due to unconsolidated data, then the comparison may incorrectly return `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison of blocks takes into account their actual content rather than just their datatype and manager locations. We should focus on comparing the values within the blocks rather than their metadata.

### Corrected Version of the Function `equals`:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, instead of sorting the blocks based on datatype and manager locations, we directly compare the values of the blocks using the `equals` method. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their metadata. By comparing the values within the blocks, we address the issue of identical blocks with different locations and ensure that the correct result is returned.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal even if their blocks have different locations.
