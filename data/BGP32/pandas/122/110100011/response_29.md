### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is not handling DataFrame comparison correctly.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method and expects it to return False, but the buggy function doesn't handle the comparison accurately.
3. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" indicates that the `equals` method is not behaving as expected when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations.

### Errors:
1. The `equals` method is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly.
2. The method may return True even when the blocks have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` method arises from not considering the locations of blocks when comparing two DataFrames. If the blocks are identical but in different locations, the method incorrectly returns True.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` method to compare blocks based on their content rather than their locations.
2. Ensure that identical blocks are compared correctly, regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks based on content, ignoring locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(block.values.tobytes()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks between two DataFrames is based on their content rather than their locations. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
