### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is testing the `equals` method of `DataFrame` objects and is expecting a `False` result.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a scenario where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The cause of the bug is the lack of proper handling for identical blocks with different locations during the comparison process within the `equals` method.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle the scenario where blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper handling of block comparisons with identical data but different locations.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider both data equality and block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block._get_block_locs())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return (
        len(self_blocks) == len(other_blocks) 
        and all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
    )
```

After applying this fixed version of the `equals` function, it should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, leading to a passed test and resolving the GitHub issue.
