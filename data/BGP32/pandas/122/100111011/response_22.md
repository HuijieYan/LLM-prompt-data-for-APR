The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` object. The function is incorrectly sorting and comparing blocks based on their data type and memory location, leading to a false positive result in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The root cause is that the `canonicalize` function, used for sorting blocks, only considers the data type and memory locations (`mgr_locs`). When sorting blocks for comparison, it should also take into account the actual data contained within the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the content of the blocks for sorting. Additionally, we need to ensure that the actual content of the blocks is compared in the final `all` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # include block data in canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that the comparison in the final `all` statement involves the actual block data, the function should now correctly handle cases where blocks have identical content but different memory locations.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
