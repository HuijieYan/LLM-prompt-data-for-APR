Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the axes of `self` and `other` for equality.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises because the `equals` function incorrectly validates the equality of `self` and `other` DataFrames. It specifically fails due to the mismatch in the values within the DataFrames while the function wrongly returns `True`.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure correct comparison of axes for equality.
2. Sort and compare the blocks accurately based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After making the above corrections, the function should now correctly compare the DataFrames `self` and `other`, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
