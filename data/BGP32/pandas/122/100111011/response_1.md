### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects represented by `self` and `other` by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic in the function does not consider the actual content of the data blocks. The failing test shows that when the DataFrame `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks but in different locations, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The issue arises from comparing the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists by calling the `equals` method directly on the blocks, which does not consider the internal data content of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` due to only comparing the order of blocks by the `canonicalize` function, without checking the actual data content inside those blocks. If the data blocks are the same but have different locations in the two DataFrame objects, the function incorrectly considers them to be equal.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should not solely rely on their properties but also need to compare the actual data contained within the blocks. One way to achieve this is to create a more robust equality check for the blocks which takes into consideration the actual data.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        # Compare the data within the blocks
        if isinstance(block1, IntBlock) and isinstance(block2, IntBlock):
            return block1.equals(block2)
        if isinstance(block1, ObjectBlock) and isinstance(block2, ObjectBlock):
            return block1.equals(block2)
        # For other block types, consider them equal
        return True

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the `block_equals` function, we can explicitly compare the content of the data blocks based on their specific types. This ensures a more accurate comparison when checking for equality between two DataFrame objects.
