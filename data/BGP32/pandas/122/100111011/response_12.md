### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two blocks of data frame columns for equality.
2. The issue arises in the comparison of the blocks where the location of the elements is not considered.
3. The failing test indicates that when comparing two data frames with elements in different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
4. The runtime values show that the comparison does not take into account the locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks without considering the locations of the elements within the blocks. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation when the elements are in different locations within the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the canonicalization process to include the location of the elements within the blocks for proper comparison.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's content along with the memory locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, block values, and mgr_locs to include element locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.values.toarray().tolist(),
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function includes the `block.values` along with the `block.mgr_locs` to incorporate the content and element locations within the blocks for proper comparison. This modification should address the issue and make the equality comparison more robust.
