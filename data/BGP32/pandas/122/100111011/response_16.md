### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is used to compare two BlockManager objects, `self` and `other`, by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different column order and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, which it should.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it gets `True` instead, leading to the overall test failure.
4. The runtime input/output values indicate the comparison involves axes and blocks from both `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the incorrect behavior where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the way the blocks are canonicalized before comparison in the `equals` function. If blocks have different locations (mgr_locs), they might be considered equal incorrectly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations for comparison. This will ensure that even if blocks have the same dtype name, they are still differentiated based on their actual locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block locations and updating the comparison flow accordingly, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle comparisons even when identical blocks are in different locations.
