### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the buggy code is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their `axes` are of the same length and if their `blocks` are of the same length and have equal contents.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The specific error message mentions that the assertion `True is False` failed, indicating that the comparison done by the `equals` method is incorrect.
4. By analyzing the runtime values and types provided for the buggy function, we can see that the error is likely due to how the `blocks` of the `BlockManager` are being compared. The sorting done based on dtype name and mgr_locs might not be sufficient for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison technique used in the `equals` function, where the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects are sorted based on dtype and manager locations (mgr_locs). This sorting may not adequately distinguish between different blocks within the `BlockManager`. As a result, the comparison fails to identify the actual differences between blocks, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares two `BlockManager` objects, we need to improve the comparison mechanism used for sorting the blocks. One approach could be to compare the actual block data itself rather than just the dtype and mgr_locs. By comparing the block data directly, we can ensure that the equality check considers the content of the blocks, which is essential for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is removed, and the `equals` method now directly compares the blocks using the `compare_blocks` function. This change ensures that the comparison considers the actual block data rather than just dtype and mgr_locs, resolving the bug and allowing the `equals` method to correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
