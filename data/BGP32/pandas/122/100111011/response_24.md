### Error Analysis:
The `equals` function first compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it checks if all axes are equal with `all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))`. If not, it returns `False`.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the comparison between blocks correctly. It sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might give incorrect results if the blocks have the same type but different content. Hence, even if the axes are equal, if the blocks are not in the correct order, it will return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is related to how the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. It fails to consider cases where blocks have the same type but different values, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function compares blocks based on their content rather than just their type and locations. We can modify the comparison logic to check for the equality of the actual values within each block.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    self_blocks = self.blocks.flatten()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.flatten()
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare each block's content for equality rather than just their types, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
