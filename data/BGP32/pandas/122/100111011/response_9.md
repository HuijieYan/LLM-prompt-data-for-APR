### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to check if two `DataFrame` objects have the same content. In the provided test case, `df1` and `df2` have different values in their columns, which should make the `equals` function return `False`.
2. The failure arises from comparing blocks from different locations, leading to incorrect equality.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, which means that the faulty `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic between blocks needs to be adjusted to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than relying on their location within the data frame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their location.
2. Update the comparison logic between blocks to ensure that equal blocks are correctly identified regardless of their position.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to consider block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks and adjusting the block comparison logic, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now return the correct result for comparing two `DataFrame` objects.
