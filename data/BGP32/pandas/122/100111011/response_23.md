### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects representing dataframes. The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two objects are equal. If not, it returns False.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns swapped and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False.
3. The failing test error message indicates that the comparison of dataframes returns True instead of False, causing the assertion to fail.
4. The runtime input/output values show that the function compares the dataframes based on their axes and blocks, where the axes are compared correctly, but the comparison of blocks is incorrect, leading to the wrong result.
5. The GitHub issue identifies the bug related to `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning True when the blocks have the same data but different positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. The sorting and comparison of blocks based on a canonicalization function should be corrected to handle dataframes with the same content but different block positions.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the position of the blocks in the comparison to handle cases where identical blocks are in different positions.
2. Modify the comparison logic in the function to properly sort and compare the blocks to ensure the equality comparison is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks with position included
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the `DataFrame.equals()` function should return False for the provided failing test case.
