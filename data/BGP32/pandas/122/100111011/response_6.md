### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might be problematic due to incorrect sorting or comparison of blocks.
2. The implementation of the `equals` method might not be correctly handling the comparison logic between `self` and `other`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` method. In the given buggy function, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting might not handle the blocks correctly, leading to false positives in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic is accurately performed between the blocks in `self` and `other`. We should focus on ensuring that the sorting and comparison mechanisms are correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary sorting of blocks and directly compares them based on equality. This change should address the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly with the provided failing test.
