### Identify the Bug
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` and then compares them. However, in the failing test case, the two DataFrames have the same blocks, but they are located in different positions, causing the comparison to fail.

### Error Cause
The bug causes the `equals` function to return `False` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the comparison to return `False` but receives `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently. Instead of simply sorting and comparing blocks, we should implement a more nuanced approach that considers block content irrespective of their locations.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Output of the Corrected Function
The corrected function should now correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks that are located differently. This fix should make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
