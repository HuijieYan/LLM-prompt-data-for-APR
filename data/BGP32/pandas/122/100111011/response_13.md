### Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects containing `blocks` and `axes`. It first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, then compares each axis using the `equals` method. After this, it consolidates the blocks of both objects and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks of each object using a canonicalization function and the `equals` method.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two data frames with columns of different types and values. It expects the `equals` method to return `False` since the data frames are not equal.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, which suggests that the `equals` method returned `True` incorrectly.
- The runtime values and types provided show the input parameters and variables inside the `equals` function, where some blocks and axes are in different orders between `self` and `other`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly when comparing data frames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the blocks' comparison being affected by their locations in memory, leading to incorrect equality checks.
- The sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to use the blocks' actual content for comparison instead of their order in memory. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `values.tostring()` method to compare block content rather than locations, we can ensure that identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their memory addresses. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
