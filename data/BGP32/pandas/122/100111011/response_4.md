### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The failing test aims to verify the correct behavior of the `equals` method when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered unequal. However, due to how the function is implemented, it fails to provide the expected output.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. It assumes that blocks are fully consolidated and sorted in the same order, which may not be the case. This assumption leads to incorrect equality checking, resulting in a false positive when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in a way that accommodates unconsolidated blocks and considers their content and locations more accurately. A potential strategy involves updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's content along with its type and locations, making the comparison more robust.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's content (values) in the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison to consider these values, along with the block type and locations, the corrected version of the function should address the issue and correctly identify DataFrames with different block locations as unequal.
