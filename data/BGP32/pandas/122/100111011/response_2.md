### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue arises when comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager` because the comparison does not consider the order of the blocks. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks are identical but in a different order.

### Error Location:
The error is in the comparison of individual blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` due to the lack of consideration for block order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where blocks are identical but have different locations. This leads to a false positive result in the comparison, causing the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic to not only check for equality of blocks but also consider their order within the `BlockManager`. By ensuring that the order is consistent, we can accurately determine if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a consistent criterion, we ensure that our comparison accounts for block order, resolving the issue identified in the failing test case and GitHub report.
