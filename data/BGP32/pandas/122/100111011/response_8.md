### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test case

- The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two objects have the same structure and elements. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are created with different values to assert that they are not equal using the `equals` method. However, the test fails with an assertion error.
- The failing test creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and values, expecting the `equals` method to return `False`.
- The error message states that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True`.

### Identifying potential error locations in the buggy function

1. The first potential issue is in the comparison of axis values while checking the length of axes.
2. The next error might be in the comparison of blocks based on `canonicalize` function.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison logic within the function. When comparing DataFrames, the function should consider the order of columns and their values. However, it fails to handle cases where the column order and values differ, resulting in a false positive equality check.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To address the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison takes into account both the structure and elements of the DataFrames.
2. Modify the comparison logic to compare columns in the correct order, checking both column names and values.
3. Update the `equals` function to correctly identify cases where DataFrames are not equal due to column order or value differences.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_sorted_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_sorted_blocks()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- `get_sorted_blocks` sorts the blocks by columns and values order.
- The comparison now properly handles cases where columns are in different orders or have different values.

By applying these corrections, the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where DataFrames are not equal, resolving the bug.
