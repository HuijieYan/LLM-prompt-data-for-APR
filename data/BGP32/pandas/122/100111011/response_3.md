### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, then consolidating them in place, and finally comparing the blocks within them. The issue arises when comparing the blocks since they are sorted differently leading to incorrect comparison results.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with columns in different orders, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`. However, the buggy function mistakenly returns `True` due to incorrect block comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which generates a key to sort blocks but doesn't handle cases where blocks are in different orders but still equivalent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to reorganize the sorting mechanism of blocks to consider both type name and locations, ensuring that equivalent blocks are correctly sorted for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the function should now properly handle comparisons of `BlockManager` instances according to the expected behavior, passing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
