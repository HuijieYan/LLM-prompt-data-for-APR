### Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` objects. The cause of the issue is that the comparison is based on the order of the blocks rather than the actual values within them. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when the blocks have identical data but differing locations.

To fix this issue:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to compare the values within blocks, not just their order or locations.
2. Modify the comparison in the `equals` function to take into account the actual block content.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `np.array_equal` to compare the values of blocks in the `equals` function, we ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their order or locations.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test, correctly returning `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2` in the provided test case.
