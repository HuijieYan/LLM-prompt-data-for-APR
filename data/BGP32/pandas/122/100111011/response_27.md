### Analysis and Explanation
1. The `equals` function is checking if the axes of `self` and `other` are equal and then proceeds to check if the blocks are equal. The issue arises when the function sorts the blocks based on their type and manager locations, which can cause similar blocks with different locations to be considered as different.
2. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, in which the values are flipped for columns 'a' and 'b', leading to a case where the blocks have the same content but differ in their positions.
3. The failing assertion `assert True is False` occurs because the function incorrectly determines that the two DataFrames are equal when they are not due to the issue in the sorting of blocks based on type and location.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality comparison of blocks accounts for situations where the content is the same but the manager locations are different. We can modify the way the blocks are compared to avoid this sorting issue.
5. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrames based on their blocks' content rather than their sorting based on type and location. This correction should resolve the issue where identical blocks with different locations were wrongly considered as different.
