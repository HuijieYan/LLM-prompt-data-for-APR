### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different value types, expecting `df1` and `df2` not to be equal.
3. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returns `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The failure occurs because the current implementation of the `equals` function does not properly handle situations where blocks have the same content but different locations, leading to incorrect `True` returns.

### Bugs and Potential Fixes:
1. The comparison logic based on sorted blocks may not consider the actual content but rather the order, causing the incorrect result.
2. The failure stems from the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function and comparing blocks directly without considering the content's equality.

### Bug Cause:
The `equals` function incorrectly compares DataFrame blocks based on a block's location rather than the actual content. If two DataFrames have blocks with the same data but different locations, it can mistakenly determine them as unequal due to the sorting logic.

### Proposed Fix:
Revise the `canonicalize` function to ensure it prioritizes the content equality rather than block locations. Update the comparison logic to compare block data directly for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version should address the bug by comparing blocks directly for equality, ensuring that the function returns the correct result and passes the failing test.
