### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` fails to correctly compare the blocks in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames with columns having different data types and values. The expectation is that the `equals` method should return `False` as the DataFrames are not equal.
3. The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the failing assertion is due to the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The runtime values and types of variables inside the function show that the approach to comparing blocks and their locations is invalid.
5. The GitHub issue posted confirms the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method in handling identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the flawed comparison logic within the `equals` method, specifically the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on block type name and manager locations. This sorting mechanism fails to account for cases where identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be modified to consider the equality of blocks directly without relying on sorting. The comparison should be based on the blocks themselves rather than their types and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without sorting based on type name and location, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now handle the equality comparison of `BlockManager` objects appropriately, passing the failing test and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
