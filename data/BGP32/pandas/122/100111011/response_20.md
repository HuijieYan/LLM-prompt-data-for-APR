### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is expected to compare two `DataFrame` objects and return `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise. 
2. The error message indicates that the function is erroneously returning `True` for two non-identical data frames.
3. The input data frames `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types which is the cause of failure.
4. The function needs to be modified to account for comparing columns with different data types which currently results in an incorrect comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `equals` function to explicitly check for columns with different data types and return `False` in such cases.
2. Update the logic of the function to account for data type differences while comparing data frames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if set(self.dtypes) != set(other.dtypes):  # check for different data types
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The modified version includes a check for the data types of the columns during comparison, ensuring that columns with different data types are not incorrectly marked as equal. This should resolve the issue and the failing test case.
