### Error Cause:
The buggy function fails because it incorrectly compares DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `.equals()` method. The function assumes that the order of the columns matters when comparing DataFrames, leading to a false positive comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to handle DataFrame comparison correctly by ignoring the order of the columns.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns):
        return False

    if not all(self[col].equals(other[col]) for col in self.columns):
        return False
    
    # Check row order since column order is already checked
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function correctly compares DataFrames by directly checking if the columns are the same and then comparing the content of each column. Additionally, it compares the row order since the column order is no longer considered in the comparison.

The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to DataFrame comparison.
