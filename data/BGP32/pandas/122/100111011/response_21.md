## Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. However, the current implementation does not handle the scenario where the order of blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances is different but the content is the same.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns 'a' and 'b' having swapped values between the dataframes. The `equals` method should return False in this case since the dataframes are not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the comparison returned True instead of False.
4. The issue on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior and provides an example that shows the expected output should be False when checking the equality of two dataframes with swapped values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `equals` method to sort the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance before comparing them. This ensures that even if the order of blocks is different between two `BlockManager` instances, they will still be considered equal if the block content matches.
2. Update the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function to include both the data type and the content of the blocks to facilitate accurate comparison.
3. After sorting the blocks, compare them one by one to check equality.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        key = (str(block.dtype), block.values)
        return key

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both data type and block values, the corrected `equals` method should now handle cases where the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances is different but the content is the same, fixing the bug.
