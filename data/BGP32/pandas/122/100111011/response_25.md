### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames with columns in different orders, expecting `False` as the return value.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, the issue arises from comparing blocks in a different order due to the sorting mechanism in the function. This causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. When comparing the blocks, the sorting can mismatch the locations of blocks, leading to an incorrect result of `True`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are matched correctly in the `equals` function. We should compare the blocks based on their position rather than their type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
