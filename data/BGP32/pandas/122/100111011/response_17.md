### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but same keys. It expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the buggy function is not handling this scenario correctly.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, indicating that the buggy function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The runtime input/output values show the comparison between the BlockManagers' axes and blocks, where there is a mismatch in the data, but the function is still returning `True`.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals()` method is returning `True` incorrectly in this situation.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison step where the function is not correctly handling the case where the blocks have different data but the same locations.

### Fix:
To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to check both data and location when comparing the blocks. We can include a check within the loop to verify the data point equivalence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function will now properly compare both data and locations of the blocks, ensuring that it returns `False` when encountering differing data values.
