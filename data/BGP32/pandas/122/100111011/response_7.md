### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, checking if they are equal.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that it expects the method call `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared. The dataframe objects `df1` and `df2` have the same data, but in different columns, causing the equality check to fail incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs (block locations) needs to be adjusted to correctly determine equality under variations in block ordering.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when sorting the blocks based on dtype.name and manager locations, generating mismatches when comparing identical blocks.
The issue is caused by the sorting of blocks based solely on dtype.name and mgr_locs, leading to incorrect comparisons and the function returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include more information for distinguishing between blocks. We can concatenate `dtype.name`, `mgr_locs`, and `values` to create a tuple key for sorting the blocks, ensuring a more precise comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining dtype.name, mgr_locs, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass as the blocks will be correctly sorted and compared for equality.
