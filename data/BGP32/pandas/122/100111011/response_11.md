### Analysis:
The `equals` function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances, which represent the internal data structures of DataFrames in pandas. The function checks if the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal, then iterates over the blocks within each BlockManager and compares them. The bug seems to arise from not correctly handling the equality check of the blocks, leading to the incorrect assertion failure in the test.

### Issue:
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and asserts that they are not equal. However, the buggy `equals` function fails to correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManagers, leading to a wrong equality check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the way the `equals` function compares the blocks within the BlockManagers. It assumes that sorting the blocks by their data type and locations is sufficient for comparison. However, in cases where the blocks have the same data but in different locations (as in the failing test), the comparison fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic within the `equals` function. Instead of just sorting the blocks by data type and location, we should also compare the actual data of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManagers is done by directly comparing the data of each block. This should address the issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
