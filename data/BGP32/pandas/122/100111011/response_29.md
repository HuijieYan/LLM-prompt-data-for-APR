### Error Analysis:
- The `equals` method in the buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects. It checks if the axes of the two objects are of equal length and if all the axes are equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks within the objects and compares the blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different column data types but similar column names, causing the `equals` method to wrongly return `True` instead of `False`.
- The error message shows that the assertion fails because the expected result is `False` but the method returns `True`.
- The runtime values of variables within the function show that the input values are not reflected correctly in the return values, indicating a problem with comparing the blocks.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False` for similar blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the method's underlying comparison strategy not correctly handling cases where the block locations differ but the content is the same, leading to a false positive in comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison method within the `equals` function needs to be adjusted to consider cases where the block locations may differ but the content is the same and still return `False` in such scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the block values along with block type for equality
    return all(
        block.__class__ == oblock.__class__ and block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the comparison logic to include checking the class types with exact block content comparison, the corrected `equals` function should now return the correct result and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
