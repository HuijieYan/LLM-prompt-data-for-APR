## Analysis
- The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
- The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different data types in the columns and then expects them to be unequal.
- The error message points out that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
- The expected input/output values indicate the expected states of different variables during the execution of the failing test.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug is caused by the way the `equals()` function is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function is not considering the data type mismatch in the columns of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- The function needs to ensure that not only the blocks are equal in terms of content but also that the data types of corresponding columns match between the `BlockManager` instances.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals()` function:
1. Before comparing the blocks, check if the data types of the corresponding columns are the same between the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. If the data types are not the same, return `False`.
3. Only proceed with the block comparison if the data types match.

## Updated Function with Bug Fix
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the data types of corresponding columns match
    if any(self.blocks[i].dtype != other.blocks[i].dtype for i in range(len(self.blocks))):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks only if data types match
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By adding the check for data type consistency before comparing blocks in the `equals()` function, the bug should be fixed. Running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should now pass as expected.
