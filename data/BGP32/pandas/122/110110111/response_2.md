### Explanation of the Bug

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if they are equal. The bug arises because the function is sorting the blocks before comparing them, which can lead to incorrect results. 

1. The buggy function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. If they have a different length, it immediately returns `False`.

2. Then it checks if each axis from one `BlockManager` equals the corresponding axis of the other `BlockManager`. If any pair of axes is not equal, it returns `False`.

3. Next, it consolidates both `BlockManager` instances in place.

4. After that, it compares the length of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. If they have a different number of blocks, it returns `False`.

5. The crucial part is when the function sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the block's data type name and location. This sorting can lead to incorrect results if the blocks are equal but in different locations.

6. Finally, it compares each block from one `BlockManager` with the corresponding block from the other `BlockManager`. This comparison can fail due to the sorting done in the previous step.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to avoid sorting the blocks when comparing them. One approach is to compare blocks based on some unique identifier other than sorting by data type name and location. 

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        any(
            block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks
        ) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

This corrected version compares each block from one `BlockManager` with all blocks from the other `BlockManager`. It ensures that the two instances are considered equal if all blocks match, regardless of their order or location.

By implementing this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
