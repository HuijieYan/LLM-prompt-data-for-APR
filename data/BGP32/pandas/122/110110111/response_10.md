### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug occurs in the line where the function checks if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have different lengths. However, the bug is caused by mistakenly comparing the blocks directly instead of considering their content.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by comparing the blocks directly in the `equals` function without considering the actual content inside the blocks. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) with mismatched values within columns. When comparing `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function, it wrongly returns `True` because the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. This results in the assertion error in the test.

The expected behavior should be that the function returns `False` for cases where the blocks have identical structure but different content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare the content of the blocks instead of just comparing the block instances directly. We should iterate through the blocks and compare them properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort blocks by content and compare them
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected implementation sorts the blocks by their content before comparing them, ensuring that blocks with identical structures but different content are handled correctly. This should make the `equals` function behave as expected and pass the failing test.
