The issue arises from the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class inside the `managers.py` file of pandas. The function fails when comparing two DataFrames with the same columns but different data values, returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Analysis:
1. The function compares the axes of the two BlockManager instances (`self` and `other`) and then proceeds to compare the blocks within these instances. The comparison logic for blocks is incorrect.
2. The canonicalization function that sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations can lead to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals()` function doesn't correctly handle scenarios where the contents of two DataFrames are different but the order of blocks within them is the same. Thus, it mistakenly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager instances (`self` and `other`) accounts for the actual data values and not just the block order.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on content, not order or location
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After correcting the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class, the failing test should now pass without asserting a false positive. This fix allows for accurate comparison based on the content of the blocks rather than their order, thereby resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
