### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The bug arises due to the inconsistency in comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks before comparing them but fails to consider the block locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not account for the block locations when sorting the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for blocks in the `equals` function to consider both the block type and the block locations before making the comparison. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By modifying the sorting key to consider both the block type name and block locations, the corrected function properly handles cases where identical blocks exist with different locations. This change will ensure that the function returns the expected results and passes the failing test.
