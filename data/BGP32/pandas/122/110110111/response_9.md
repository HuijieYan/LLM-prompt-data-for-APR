The issue in the `equals` function arises because it erroneously returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations. The function performs block-wise comparison and consolidation before comparing the blocks, leading to the wrong result in this specific case.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The buggy function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with different block locations because it doesn't consider the block locations during the comparison.
2. Due to the inconsistency in block locations, the function mistakenly concludes that the blocks are the same even if their locations differ.
3. The failing test aims to verify this specific case and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix this issue, the function should take block locations into account when comparing the blocks.
2. Ensure that the comparison considers not only the block content but also the block locations to identify identical blocks correctly.
3. Update the sorting mechanism for blocks to use both the type name and the block locations to achieve a consistent order for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))  # Consider block locations
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By addressing the block location comparison issue within the `equals` function, the corrected version should now provide the expected output for the failing test case and resolve the reported bug on GitHub.
