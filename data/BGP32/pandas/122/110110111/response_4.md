### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. **Error Location**: The issue lies in how the function sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations which can lead to inconsistencies in the block orders when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
   - The comparison logic in the function fails to correctly identify the equality of blocks if their order is different between the two `BlockManager` instances.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Instead of sorting blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, you can compare each block directly without sorting.
   - The comparison should account for blocks being in different orders within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare all blocks in the same order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing blocks in the same order without relying on sorting, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly identify when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal, as expected.
