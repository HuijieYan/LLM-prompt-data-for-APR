## Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects named `self` and `other`.
2. The function initially compares the number of axes in `self` and `other` objects.
3. Then, it checks if all axes are equal using `equals` method of each axis.
4. The function then consolidates the blocks in both objects in-place.
5. It proceeds to compare the number of blocks in `self` and `other` objects.
6. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both objects based on a canonicalized function and compares each block for equality.

## Bug
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the comparison of blocks in an inconsistent order. The function sorts the blocks in both objects based on the type name and manager locations, but it does not account for the order in which blocks have been added. This causes the function to return `True` for blocks that are similar but in different order, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the blocks are compared in the correct order. One way to do this is to sort the blocks based on their indexes before comparing them. By maintaining a consistent order, we can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

## Updated Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This updated version of the `equals` function will sort the blocks based on their manager locations before comparing them, ensuring a consistent order and fixing the bug in the comparison logic.
