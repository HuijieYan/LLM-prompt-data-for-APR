### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test:

- The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
- The failing test is the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
- The test is checking if two DataFrames are not equal by calling the `equals` method on them and expecting it to return `False`.
- The error message states that the assertion failed as `True is False`.
- The expected input values for the buggy function include different DataFrames that are not equal in terms of values but are structurally similar.
- The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with the same structure but different values.

### Identifying the bug location:

The bug is likely occurring in the comparison logic of the `equals` method where it fails to properly distinguish between blocks with different locations but identical values.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs because the comparison logic in the `equals` method does not take into account the location of blocks. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, it ignores the block locations which can lead to incorrect results when two instances have blocks with the same content but different locations.

The failing test provides an example where two DataFrames have different values but in the same structure. The `equals` method fails to correctly identify them as unequal due to the lack of consideration for block locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to consider the block locations when comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. By ensuring that the comparison includes block locations, the method will be able to correctly identify DataFrames with the same structure but different block locations as unequal.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now considers the block locations in addition to the content when comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. This fix ensures that DataFrames with the same structure but different block locations are correctly identified as unequal.
