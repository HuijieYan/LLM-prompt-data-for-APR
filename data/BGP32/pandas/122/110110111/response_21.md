## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances based on their axes and blocks. If the two instances have different axes or blocks, it should return `False`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with the same column names but different values in those columns. The `equals` function is expected to return `False` for these DataFrames.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, as the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The function is sorting the self and other blocks based on a canonicalization function, but there seems to be an issue in the equality comparison.
5. The failing test expects the `equals` function to return `False` as the DataFrames have different values in the columns.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that before comparing the blocks, the axes of both instances are checked for equality. If they are not equal, return `False`.
2. Then, proceed to compare and sort the blocks based on the canonicalization method.
3. Check that the comparison between the sorted self and other blocks is correct and returns `False` if any discrepancies are found.

## Bug Fix for the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding a check for axes equality in the beginning, we can ensure that the comparison is only done if the axes are the same. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on the canonicalization method should yield the correct comparison results, satisfying the failing test case.
