### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The function compares the axes, consolidates blocks, sorts blocks, and then compares each block between the two instances.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and then asserts that the `equals` method returns `False`, which indicates that the two DataFrames are not equal.
3. The error message shows that the failing assertion is `assert True is False`, where the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to the inconsistent handling of block sorting and comparison in the `equals` function. The function does not correctly handle the case where blocks are swapped and still considers them equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done accurately by iterating through each block and checking their equivalence.

### Proposed Fix:
I will modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to accurately compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. By comparing blocks individually, we can correctly identify cases where blocks are different even if the axes match.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_blocks(blocks_list):
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        return sorted(blocks_list, key=canonicalize)

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By modifying the function to correctly sort and compare blocks individually, we ensure that the `equals` method accurately determines the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
