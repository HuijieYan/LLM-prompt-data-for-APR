### Explanation of the Bug

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check whether two `BlockManager`s are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and consolidating them if necessary.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with different values but matching columns. The test then asserts that calling the `equals` method on `df1` with `df2` as a parameter should return `False`. However, the buggy function returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to the test failure.

The primary cause of this bug is related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The blocks are sorted and compared based on their type name and manager locations, but the comparison results in incorrect equality due to the flawed comparison logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the comparison logic between the blocks needs to be adjusted in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. By refining the sorting and comparison procedure for the blocks, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize blocks based on type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a refined `canonicalize` function that accurately sorts and compares the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test case.
