### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` library is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails, indicating a bug in the `equals` function.
3. The error message shows that the comparison resulted in `True is False` which is incorrect.
4. The expected input/output values suggest that the bug is likely due to not properly handling the comparison of different data types in the blocks of the `BlockManager`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic to consider the data types when comparing blocks.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    axes_equal = all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))
    if not axes_equal:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.shape))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.shape))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their types and shapes, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly even if the blocks have different data types. This correction will address the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected.

This correction should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub regarding falsely returning `True` when comparing `DataFrame` blocks with different locations.
