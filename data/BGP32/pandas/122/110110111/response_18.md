## Bug Analysis

1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class within `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing the issue.
2. **Test Code**: The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. **Error Message**: The assertion error indicates that `assert True is False` is failing.
4. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - Expected Input: Two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' having different values.
   - Expected Output: The `equals` function should return `False`.
5. **GitHub Issue**: The issue on GitHub reports a similar problem with DataFrame equality check returning True incorrectly.

## Bug Location

The bug seems to be in the logic of comparing block data within the `equals` function. It tries to compare sorted blocks, but the blocks may have unconsolidated data that's not handled correctly.

## Bug Explanation

1. The `equals` function first compares the number of axes. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
2. Then, it compares the axes themselves. If any pair is not equal, it returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates the blocks of both `self` and `other`.
4. It checks if the number of blocks in both structures is equal. If not, it returns `False`.
5. The function then tries to sort the blocks based on a provided key function `canonicalize`, which seems to be key to correct data comparison.
6. Finally, it checks each pair of blocks and uses the `equals` method of blocks for comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison handles unconsolidated blocks correctly. Additionally, the sorting mechanism of blocks based on `canonicalize` needs to differentiate between blocks. We can consider revising the block comparison logic to check for block type and locs for a more accurate comparison.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,  # Differentiates block types
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(),  # Use the byte representation of locs
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison between unconsolidated blocks based on block type and by converting location data to byte format for accurate differentiation.

By applying this fix, the DataFrame equality check should return `False` as expected in the failing test case, resolving the bug.
