### Bug Fix:

Based on the provided information, the issue arises because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly, which causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, considering their dtype and location information. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to generate a key that includes both the dtype name and the manager locations of the block. This will make the comparison of blocks more accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class definitions...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Modified canonicalize function to include manager locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexer))
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using a combination of dtype name and manager locations to canonically sort the blocks before comparison, we can ensure that the `equals` function accurately detects differences in block locations while comparing DataFrames. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should make the failing test pass successfully.
