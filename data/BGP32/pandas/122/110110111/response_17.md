The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing two DataFrames with the same data but in different column positions. The function currently compares the blocks directly without considering the ordering. To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the blocks are equivalent but have different locations due to column reordering.


## Correction to the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # create canonicalized blocks by column name
    self_cols = [objmgr_locs for objmgr_locs in self.placements]
    other_cols = [objmgr_locs for objmgr_locs in other.placements]
    self_columns = [self.blocks[i] for i in self_cols]
    other_columns = [other.blocks[i] for i in other_cols]
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_columns, other_columns)
    )
```

By canonicalizing the blocks based on column names, this corrected version of the `equals` function should correctly handle cases where the blocks are equivalent but in different locations due to column reordering. The function compares the blocks based on the column names, ensuring that DataFrames with the same data in different column positions are correctly identified as not equal.

With this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test function should now pass successfully, returning the expected value of `False` when comparing the two DataFrames with swapped column values.
