After analyzing the buggy function, its relationship with the buggy class, the failing test, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, we can see that the bug occurs due to the comparison of DataFrame blocks with different locations.

The bug is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. In particular, the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This bug results in the failing test we provided, where it expects the `equals` function to return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic between blocks. Instead of relying on the sorted order of the blocks, we need to compare the blocks directly based on their content while ignoring the specific locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly based on content, ignoring location
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other.blocks:
            return False

    return True
```

With this modification, we directly compare the content of each block between the two DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is valid regardless of the specific locations of the blocks.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub about the incorrect behavior of `equals` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
