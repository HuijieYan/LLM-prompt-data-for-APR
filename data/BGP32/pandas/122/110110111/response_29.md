## Analysis
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects if they are sorted differently. The issue arises because the code is comparing the blocks directly instead of comparing based on a canonical representation of the block.

## Bug Location
The bug arises in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects directly without considering the order in which the blocks are stored.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the use of a direct comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`. When the blocks are stored in different orders in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the direct comparison fails even though the data within the blocks is the same.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks in a canonical order so that blocks with the same data are considered equal regardless of their order in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.

## Revised Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalizing the blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype, block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version introduces a `canonicalize` function that creates a tuple representing the block, taking into account the block type, dtype, and values. By sorting the blocks before comparison, we guarantee that equivalent blocks are considered equal.

Now, the `equals` function should correctly compare `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
