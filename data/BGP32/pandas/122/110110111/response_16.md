### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function, expecting it to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The expected input/output values indicate the correct values and types of variables during the function's execution.

### Error Cause:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks in two different data structures without considering the order of the blocks. This results in a wrong comparison and leads to the function returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the order of blocks during comparison. We can modify the function to sort the blocks based on a canonical attribute before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both the type name and the location, the function ensures that the blocks are compared in the correct order, fixing the bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly identified as equal.
