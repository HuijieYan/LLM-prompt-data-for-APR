The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class fails when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations. The issue arises because the function does not properly handle checking block equality based on the block locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison. Furthermore, when comparing blocks for equality, we should consider the block contents along with their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().nbytes, block.shape, block._get_block_number(), block.get_values().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are including block sizes, shape, block number, and the block values in the `canonicalize` function. This addition ensures that blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

By incorporating these changes, the `equals()` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` and address the issue reported on GitHub related to identical blocks with different locations.
