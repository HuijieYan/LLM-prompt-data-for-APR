## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The error arises when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

## Error location
The error mainly lies in the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. 

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames created with different data types for columns 'a' and 'b'. The `equals` method is expected to return `False` as the DataFrames have different data types for the same columns, but it incorrectly returns `True`.

The buggy function's logic first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects correctly. Then, it compares the blocks using the `equals` method. However, the issue arises when the blocks are being sorted and compared based on a tuple of data type name and manager locations (to handle unconsolidated blocks). This sorting is causing the function to consider the two DataFrames equal, even when their block data types are different.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function that is used for sorting the blocks. Instead of comparing the data type name, we should focus on comparing the actual data values within the blocks. This change will ensure that the comparison considers the block's content rather than just the type name, leading to a correct equality check.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
# Fixing the buggy function equals in the BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new canonicalize function for sorting blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.to_numpy().tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks based on their actual content, ensuring that DataFrames with different column data types are considered unequal.
