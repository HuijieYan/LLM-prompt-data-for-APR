### Fixing the Bug
The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals()` method, resulting in a `True` return instead of the expected `False` when the blocks have identical content but different locations. The issue stems from the way the `equals()` method compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. This function should take into account not only the block's type name but also its content for proper comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on its content
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, NumericBlock):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function will compare the blocks in a way that considers the content rather than just the type name and locations. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
