The buggy function `equals` is not comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances correctly, leading to a failure in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue arises because the function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it does not take into account the actual values within the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the block along with dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This way, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their metadata.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the values of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison will now consider the actual content of the blocks, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
