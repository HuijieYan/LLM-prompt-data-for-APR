### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` with mismatched values, and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
3. The failing test error message shows that the assertion failed because `True is False`, indicating that the buggy `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return `False` for mismatched `BlockManager` instances.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug in the Code:
The bug arises due to the improper comparison of blocks with different locations. The `canonicalize` function attempts to order the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but the manager locations are not correctly compared.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. One way to resolve this issue is to convert the manager locations to a tuple before comparison. This change should ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered before comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By converting the manager locations to a tuple before comparison in the `canonicalize` function, the blocks will be correctly ordered and compared, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
