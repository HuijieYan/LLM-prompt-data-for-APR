## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values for columns `a` and `b`, then checks if they are not equal using the `equals` method.
4. The error message shows that the assertion failed since it expected `True` but received `False`.
5. The expected output is for the `equals` function to return `False` since the two dataframes are not equal.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` method compares `Block` objects directly which causes the comparison to fail even when the dataframes have different values in the columns. This happens because the blocks are sorted by a tuple combining the type name and locator, leading to non-matching blocks being considered as equal.

The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and locator, causing identical blocks with different locations to be presented as different blocks, resulting in a false positive comparison.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to avoid sorting by locator.
2. Keep the block order based on dtype only for comparison.
3. Compare blocks based on their values rather than sorting by type and locator.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values[0])
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values[0])
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the comparison will be based on the block values rather than their types or locations, ensuring correct behavior.

This update should fix the issue reported on GitHub about wrongly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
