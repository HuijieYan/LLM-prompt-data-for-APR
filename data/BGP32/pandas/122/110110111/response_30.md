The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class originates from the comparison logic between two `BlockManager` instances. 

### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method first compares the axes of both `self` and `other` instances. If the lengths and labels of the axes are not equal, the function returns `False`.
2. It then proceeds to consolidate both instances in place, sorts the blocks in the instances by a canonicalization function, and compares the blocks of the two instances.
3. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function, where it attempts to use `block.dtype.name` which could potentially lead to incorrect sorting and comparison as the dtype name is not sufficient for distinguishing categorical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to enhance the comparison strategy to properly consider the equality of blocks within different locations. One approach is to match blocks by dtype and then compare each block's values. This way, even if the blocks are at different locations, they can be correctly identified as equal if their data is the same.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will now compare the values of blocks rather than just their dtype, ensuring that the equality check is performed correctly even when blocks are at different locations.

This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
