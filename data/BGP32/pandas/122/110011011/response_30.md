### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their attributes. 
2. The error occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, where the blocks are sorted based on dtype name and manager locations. This can lead to incorrect results in case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` DataFrame objects is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function when dealing with identical blocks in different locations.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison mechanism for blocks within the `BlockManager` objects to accurately determine equality.
2. Instead of sorting and comparing based on dtype name and manager locations, we should consider a more robust approach to compare the blocks.
   
### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the blocks directly without sorting them based on dtype name and manager locations, ensuring correctness in equality comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
