### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class checks for equality between two instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug arises when comparing two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, where the order of columns is switched. The method erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method, where the sorting of blocks is based on the combination of type name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparisons, especially with unconsolidated blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on more reliable criteria, possibly only on the type name.
5. By accurately comparing blocks, the corrected function should return the expected result for the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After fixing the bug as shown above, the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method will be based solely on the type name. This change should resolve the incorrect equality comparison issue and make the function behave as expected.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test to ensure that it now returns the correct output.
