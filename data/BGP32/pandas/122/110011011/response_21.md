### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the contents of two `BlockManager` instances, which represent different data structures within pandas.
2. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates the data, sorts and compares the blocks inside each `BlockManager`.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` DataFrames is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The initial comparison of axis lengths and subsequent comparison of each block in the `BlockManager` instances needs to be revised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to correctly handle the comparison of different blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Ensure that the equality check involves comparing the block contents effectively.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.make_block(new_blocks=block.blocks, new_axes=block.axes).values.tolist(), block.items.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values and items, and ensuring proper comparison for content equality, the corrected function should now address the bug and pass the failing test case.
