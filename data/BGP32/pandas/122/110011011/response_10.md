### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. 
2. The failing tests show that the comparison fails even when the axes are equal due to a mismatch in block order.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The `equals` function first checks if axes are equal, then consolidates the data internally and compares the blocks. The bug arises from differences in the block order causing false positive equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them. This ensures that the order of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects does not affect the equality result.
2. We need to create a canonicalization method to sort the blocks based on block type and location.
3. After sorting the blocks, we can then compare them for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their canonical representation before comparing, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now correctly handle cases where the block order differs but the actual content is the same. This should resolve the failing test and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
