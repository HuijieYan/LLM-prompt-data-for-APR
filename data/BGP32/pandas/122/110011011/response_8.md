### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects. It first checks if the axes of the two BlockManagers are of equal length, and then iterates over each axis to check if they are equal.
2. The issue seems to stem from the comparison of blocks within the BlockManagers. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, which includes the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting order may not match the expected block order leading to false positives.
3. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, which have swapped columns. The expectation is for `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is returning `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly without leading to false positives.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block's labels along with dtype for a more accurate sorting criteria.
2. Utilize these updated sorting criteria in sorting the blocks before comparison.
3. This change should ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and the function returns the expected results for DataFrames with swapped columns.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block labels and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.blknos)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block labels in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on a combination of dtype, block locations, and labels, reducing the likelihood of false positives in the comparison.
