### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. From the runtime values provided, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison involving blocks of different types but with identical data (int64 and object blocks with a different order).
4. The GitHub issue confirms the problem where the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical data but different block locations.
5. To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be modified to consider data equality even if block order or location differs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider data equality irrespective of block order.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on dtype and data to ensure correct equality checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype and data values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above corrected version, the issue where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as unequal should be resolved. This modification ensures that the comparison takes into account the data values and dtype, leading to correct equality checking for BlockManager objects.
