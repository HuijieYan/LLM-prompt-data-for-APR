### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of axes length: `if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):`
2. The comparison of individual axes using `equals` method: `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):`

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the internal blocks of two DataFrames. The method first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two DataFrames are equal, then it iterates over each axis and checks for equality using the `equals` method which involves the comparison of the blocks.

In this case, the issue arises when the blocks are compared in the line:
```python
return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
Due to some inconsistencies or variations in block locations, even if the blocks within the DataFrames are the same, they may not be recognized as equal causing the method to incorrectly return `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for the block locations in a more precise manner. By ensuring that the block order is canonicalized properly, we can accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and block data to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, the comparison between blocks now includes the block values as well, ensuring that the equality check is done based on both the block data and their locations. This modification should resolve the issue and make the `equals` method function correctly.
