### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and if the blocks' content in each manager is equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returned `True`, which is incorrect.
3. The bug seems to be caused by the way the blocks are ordered and compared within the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner before comparing them to address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks when they have different locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` instances in a consistent way before comparing them.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's index as well to ensure a proper sorting order.
3. Make sure to compare the block data in a uniform manner after sorting to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block data for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their dtype, mgr_locs, and values during comparison, this corrected version should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that comparing two `BlockManager` instances using the `equals` method behaves as expected.
