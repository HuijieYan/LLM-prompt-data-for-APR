### Analysis
The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first compares the `axes` of the two instances, then consolidates them, and finally compares the `blocks` within the instances.

From the error message and runtime values, we can see that the function is not returning the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` instances representing DataFrames. The function is considering the same blocks with different locations as equal, which is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the comparison logic inside the `equals()` function. In particular, the canonicalization of blocks does not take into account the locations of the blocks. As a result, identical blocks with different locations are being considered equal.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to enhance the canonicalization of blocks in a way that takes into account both the block types (e.g., `dtype.name`) and the block locations (e.g., `mgr_locs`) in the comparison process. By considering both block contents and locations, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but located differently are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using type, data, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block values along with the block `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` in the canonicalization process, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
