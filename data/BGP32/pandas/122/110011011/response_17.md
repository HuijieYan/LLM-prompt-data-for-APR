### Bug Analysis:

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and data blocks. The issue arises when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails because the comparison wrongly evaluates to `True`.

Looking at the runtime values and types provided, we see that the blocks in `self` and `other` have the same data but different locations, causing the `equals` function to give an incorrect result.

### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on their content without considering their locations. While comparing, the function should not only check if the content is the same but also if the content is correctly placed in the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include both the block content and its location. This ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, content, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block's content, type, and locations in the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that blocks are compared including their correct locations, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
