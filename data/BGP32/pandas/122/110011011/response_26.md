### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test is asserting that two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) are not equal, but the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`.
3. The bug occurs because the function fails to compare the objects properly, leading to a false positive result.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks to ensure consistent comparisons. However, the bug might be related to how block equality is checked.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on all relevant attributes to determine true equality.
   
### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._data, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction , the bug that caused the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly is fixed, and it should now provide the expected behavior.
