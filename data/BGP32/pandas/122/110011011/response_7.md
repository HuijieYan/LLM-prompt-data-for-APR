### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length in `equals` function between `self` and `other`.
2. Comparison of axes equality using `equals` method in a loop.
3. Comparison of the number of blocks in `self` and `other`.
4. Sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function.
5. Comparison of individual blocks using `equals` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function first checks the lengths of axes to ensure they are the same, but in the case described, the axes are of the same length. Then, it proceeds to compare the equality of axes using the `equals` method which fails to identify the axes of `self` and `other` as different.

The comparison then continues with the number of blocks, which could be the same but with a different structure, leading to a false positive result. The sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function and subsequent comparison of individual blocks using `equals` method may further contribute to the incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify the comparison of axis content and ensure that both `self` and `other` have the same order and structure.
2. Implement a robust comparison mechanism for blocks considering their content, data type, and structure.
3. Update the sorting mechanism to properly handle different block structures for a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.items()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.items()

    for label, block in self_blocks:
        if label not in other_blocks or not block.equals(other_blocks[label]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures a more thorough comparison of the axes and blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects, correctly identifying the cases where they are not equal.
