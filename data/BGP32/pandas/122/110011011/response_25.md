### Error Analysis:
- The `equals()` function is used to check the equality between two `BlockManager` instances, comparing their axes and blocks.
- The error originates from the comparison logic of the `equals()` function, where it fails to correctly handle blocks with different locations. This results in the function returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2` (as per the provided GitHub issue).
- The comparison logic within the function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks without considering the location variance, leading to the erroneous result.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function compares blocks based on their data type and manager locations without considering the actual data within the blocks and how their order might affect equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison logic to consider the actual data within the blocks, ensuring it accounts for the differences in block locations.
- We have to update the `canonicalize()` function to include the block's data in addition to the data type and manager locations for accurate comparison.
- Modify the block comparison section within a loop to check for the actual block data equality rather than relying only on block type and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the `canonicalize()` function to consider the block data as well in the comparison.
- Updated the sorting and comparison logic within the loop to check for data equality between the blocks.

By implementing these changes, the `equals()` function should now correctly handle the comparison of `BlockManager` instances and address the issue reported on GitHub.
