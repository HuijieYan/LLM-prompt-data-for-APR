### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The comparison is based on the equality of axes and blocks within each object.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.
- The `equals` function first checks the equality of axes, then consolidates the block data within each object before comparing the blocks.
- The bug seems to arise due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect block comparison.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The sorting order based on dtype and mgr_locs might not correctly distinguish blocks, especially for unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, avoid relying solely on dtype and mgr_locs for block sorting, as it may not provide a reliable comparison metric.
- Consider alternative methods for determining block equivalence that do not rely on potentially misleading features like dtype names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare blocks without unnecessary sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing blocks without sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs, this corrected version should address the issue and ensure correct comparison of `BlockManager` objects in the `equals` function.
