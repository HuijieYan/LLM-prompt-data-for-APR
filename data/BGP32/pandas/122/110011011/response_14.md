### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two `DataFrame` instances fails, returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The issue seems to stem from the comparison logic where the ordering of blocks might not be considered correctly.
4. The error was raised in the test case due to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the ordering of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. When sorting the blocks before comparison, the key combination of `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` neglects an essential distinction between blocks leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the ordering of blocks should consider only the `block.dtype.name` for canonicalization to correctly identify blocks regardless of their location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly.
