### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks, returning `True` when the blocks are identical but located differently.
2. The failing test indicated that it expected `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but instead, it was evaluated as `True`.
3. The buggy function sorts the blocks before comparison, but due to different locations within the blocks, the comparison of the blocks fails, causing the function to return `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check for block equality without considering their location or order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that it only considers the type name for sorting blocks, not their locations.
2. Use the modified `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparison.
3. Update the `equals` function to return `False` only if the sorted blocks are not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block types only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their block types only and return `False` when the blocks are not equal. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
