### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
2. The error message shows that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` but it is currently returning `True`.
3. The input values and types provided cover the relevant variables used in the function, including axes, blocks, and block details.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the DataFrame method `equals()` is returning True incorrectly for the provided test case.
   
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the blocks have identical content but are located at different positions within the BlockManager.
- The sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function might not ensure correct comparison due to different block locations.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare block content instead of location.
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the actual data within the blocks rather than their locations.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to compare block content instead of location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should properly compare the content of blocks within the BlockManager objects, ensuring that the `equals()` method behaves as expected.
