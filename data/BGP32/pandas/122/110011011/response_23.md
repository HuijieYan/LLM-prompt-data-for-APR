### Analysis:
1. **Bug in the function `equals`**: The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug causing the comparison to return True even when the blocks have different locations. This bug is leading to failing test cases as shown in the error message.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug seems to be in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function, specifically in the comparison logic inside the `canonicalize` function where the ordering is based on dtype name and manager locations, which does not handle the scenario of blocks with identical data but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations to ensure a consistent order. However, if the blocks have the same data but different locations (as in the failing test case), the comparison fails since it expects all blocks to be in the same order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual data values within the blocks instead of just the dtype name and manager locations. By comparing the data content, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_array().tobytes()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to serialize the block data into bytes and comparing these bytes, we ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations will be considered equal. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
