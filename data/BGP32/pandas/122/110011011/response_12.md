### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates and sorts the blocks based on type and locations within the manager to perform the comparison.
   
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the differences between the two instances of `BlockManager`.

3. From the provided runtime values and types, it can be seen that the function is correctly comparing the axes and the lengths of the blocks but is not sorting the blocks properly based on their properties.

4. The bug seems to be related to the way the blocks are being sorted before the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the way the blocks are sorted in the `equals` function to ensure that they are ordered consistently for comparison.
2. Utilize a better sorting mechanism that takes into consideration the block's properties like dtype and mgr_locs to avoid false positive comparisons.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes[0].name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version will properly sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before performing the comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not falsely matched.
