### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of Pandas.
- The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between the two instances is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Location:
1. The comparison between the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances may be incorrect.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` might not work as intended.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the sorting and comparison of the blocks. It is comparing the internal representation of the blocks (`dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`) which may not guarantee correct equality for different instances with the same data.
- In the failing case, the comparison fails where the blocks are swapped between the two instances, causing the check to return `True` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing:
- Instead of relying solely on the comparison of dtype name and `mgr_locs` which may vary between identical blocks, consider comparing the actual data stored in the blocks.
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the data within the blocks for equality.
- Check equality of the real data inside the blocks instead of their internal representations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual block data for equality, the corrected version of the function should now correctly identify differences between two instances of `BlockManager`.
