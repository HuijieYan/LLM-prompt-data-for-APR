### Explanation:

1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, compares the number of blocks they contain, sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, and finally compares each block for equality.
   
2. The error message is indicating that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This discrepancy suggests that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is not working as expected.

3. From the runtime values and types provided, it is evident that the issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is being applied to the blocks for sorting. The `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call is not providing the expected output, causing the blocks to be sorted incorrectly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent representation of the blocks for proper sorting. One way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to work reliably with the block's internal data structures, ensuring that the sorting based on block type name and manager locations is consistent and accurate.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `type(block).__name__` and `str(block.mgr_locs)` to generate a consistent sort key for each block. This modification ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type name and locations, providing a reliable comparison result.
