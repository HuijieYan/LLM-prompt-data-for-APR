### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The function seems to be comparing the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` instances, which contain blocks of data. The comparison logic might not be accurate due to the way the `blocks` are sorted and compared.

### Bug Location:
1. The erroneous logic is likely present in the `equals` function where the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted and compared block by block.
2. The issue seems to stem from the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is expected to return a tuple containing the block's `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`.
2. Sorting the blocks based on this information may not accurately represent the equality of the data blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of sorting and comparing block by block based on `canonicalize`, a better approach would be to compare the blocks directly.
2. Comparing the blocks directly would ensure that the data within each block is evaluated for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Ensure the blocks are consolidated before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare each block for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality, the function should now accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
