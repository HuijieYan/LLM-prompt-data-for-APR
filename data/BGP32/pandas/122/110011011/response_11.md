### Analysis:
1. **Issue Description**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames that have identical block values but different block locations.
2. **Error Location**: The error seems to be happening in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The issue arises because the `equals` function compares blocks based on a sorted order after consolidating them.
   - Identical blocks with different locations are sorted differently resulting in a false positive comparison.
4. **Suggested Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on actual values rather than their order.
   - Avoid sorting the blocks based on their types and locations during the comparison.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on values directly
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual values rather than their types or locations, the `equals` function will now return `False` correctly in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
