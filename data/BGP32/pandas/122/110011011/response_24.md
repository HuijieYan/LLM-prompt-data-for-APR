### Analysis:
The `equals()` function is comparing two BlockManager instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs when identifying the equality of blocks due to ordering differences arising from the way blocks are sorted. This leads to wrong results when comparing two identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize()` function, resulting in different locations of blocks being considered unequal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals()` function to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the sorting of blocks by type name and locations leading to unexpected outcomes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on type name alone, disregarding specific block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using type name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the type name only, the corrected version ensures that identical blocks are properly identified as equal, resolving the issue of returning unexpected `True` for DataFrames with blocks in different locations.
