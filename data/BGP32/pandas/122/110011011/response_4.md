### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` might not provide the expected result for identical blocks with different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function might not be correctly handling the block's locations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `equals` fails to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. Due to the comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` after sorting them based on type name and locations, the function may wrongly return `True` for seemingly identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how blocks are compared. One way to approach this could be to compare identical blocks regardless of their locations. We can achieve this by altering the comparison logic in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting based on block locations and only sorts blocks based on their dtype names before comparing them. This should ensure that the `equals` function handles identical blocks with different locations correctly.
