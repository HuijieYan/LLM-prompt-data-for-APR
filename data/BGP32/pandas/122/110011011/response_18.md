### Analysis:
The buggy `equals()` function is implemented in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances by first comparing their axes, then consolidating them, and finally comparing their blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison is yielding `True` when it should be `False`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The comparison of axes might fail to accurately determine inequality.
2. The sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs might not handle unconsolidated blocks properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate comparison of axes.
2. Update block sorting to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # update the canonicalize function to handle unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'consolidate'):
            # consolidate the block before canonicalization
            block = block.consolidate()
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks and potentially consolidate them before sorting, we can ensure accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
