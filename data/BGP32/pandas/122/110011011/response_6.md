### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes and blocks of two instances. 
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing when the data in the axes and blocks are in different orders.
3. The function fails to correctly compare the blocks due to the sorting process based on `canonicalize` function and doesn't consider the correct order in which the data appears.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to account for the order in which the data appears rather than just sorting based on certain characteristics.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np  # for array comparison

# Buggy function to fix
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content, not just order
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.mgr_locs.row, x.mgr_locs.col))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.mgr_locs.row, x.mgr_locs.col))
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, other_block.values) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the row and column indices before comparing their values using `np.array_equal()`, we ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just the order.

This should fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect equality comparison of DataFrame blocks.
