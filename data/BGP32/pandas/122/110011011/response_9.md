### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison of axes lengths between `self` and `other`.
2. Comparison of axes using the `equals` method.
3. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from the comparison logic in the `equals` function. When comparing the axes of `self` and `other`, the function erroneously returns `True` if the lengths match, but the axes themselves are not equal. This causes the function to give incorrect results, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic between the axes of `self` and `other`. Instead of comparing just the lengths and calling the `equals` method on each pair of axes, we should directly compare the axes themselves. Additionally, we should ensure that the block comparison after sorting is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version directly compares each pair of axes to ensure they are equal. Additionally, it ensures that the number of blocks matches before proceeding to compare the blocks. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test.
