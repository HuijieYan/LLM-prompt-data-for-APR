### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function compares the axes lengths, then consolidates both instances in place, and finally compares the blocks.
3. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, it returns `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug causes the incorrect comparison of blocks due to the sorting mechanism used.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way blocks are compared in the `equals` function.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block keys
    self_keys = [(block.mgr_locs[0] if len(block.mgr_locs) > 0 else None) for block in self.blocks]
    other_keys = [(block.mgr_locs[0] if len(block.mgr_locs) > 0 else None) for block in other.blocks]
    
    self_blocks = [block for _, block in sorted(zip(self_keys, self.blocks))]
    other_blocks = [block for _, block in sorted(zip(other_keys, other.blocks))]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on block keys (in this case, the first manager location), we can ensure that identical blocks in different positions are correctly compared.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
