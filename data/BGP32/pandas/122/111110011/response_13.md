### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function compares two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in the same columns and expects `equals` method to return False. The error message shows that the assertion fails as it expects `True is False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the exact problem where `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug Reason:
The bug exists in the `equals` method where it compares sorted blocks from two BlockManager instances without considering different locations of blocks. It doesn't properly handle the equality check when the order of blocks differs in the two instances.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider not just the content of the blocks but also their positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this correction should address the bug and make the `equals` method function as expected, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
