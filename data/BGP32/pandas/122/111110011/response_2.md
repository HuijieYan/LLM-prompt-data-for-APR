### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axis, blocks, and block order.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns "a" and "b" having different data types and values, and then asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` function.
3. The failing test error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue points out that this bug causes `DataFrame.equals()` to wrongly return `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is in the comparison logic of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from the way blocks are sorted and compared for equality without considering the block locations, leading to incorrect evaluation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks to consider both the dtype name and the block locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations in the `canonicalize` function along with dtype and values, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled during comparisons. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
