### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and their contents.
2. The function uses a sorting mechanism to compare the blocks present in the `BlockManager` objects.
3. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to check if two DataFrames are equal or not but is failing due to the buggy behavior of the `equals` function.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, as it's currently returning `True` when it should return `False`.
5. The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" reports the same issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used inside the `equals` function considers the block's dtype name and manager locations (via `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`) to compare the blocks. This comparison logic can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal, leading to `equals` erroneously returning `True` when comparing two seemingly equal `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix involves modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks while ignoring the location information, focusing solely on the dtype names of the blocks for a more accurate equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now compare `BlockManager` instances solely based on the dtype of the blocks, ensuring that blocks with the same dtype are considered equal regardless of their locations.
