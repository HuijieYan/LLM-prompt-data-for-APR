### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison logic involves checking the equality of the axes, consolidating the blocks, and then comparing individual blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides an example where two DataFrames are intentionally created with different values in corresponding columns to test the `equals` function.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison incorrectly resulted in `True` instead of `False` when two DataFrames with different values were compared.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function `equals` may arise from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The sorting and comparing of blocks using tuple combinations of type names and manager locations might not work correctly for distinguishing between blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class because the comparison logic is incorrectly implemented when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. In particular, the sorting of blocks based on a combination of type names and manager locations (`mgr_locs`) may not correctly differentiate between blocks which are actually different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This can be achieved by revising the sorting condition used to compare blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block)).encode('utf-8')

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use the type name and a unique representation of the block as the sorting key, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly handle comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This updated logic ensures that blocks with different content but identical types are considered not equal.
