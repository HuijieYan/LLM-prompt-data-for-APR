### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` compares two instances of `BlockManager` class for equality.
2. The buggy function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal and if the number of blocks in the two instances are equal.
3. The bug arises from the comparison of individual blocks in the two instances. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly when the blocks have the same content but different locations.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the bug by creating two DataFrames where columns have swapped values and asserts that they are not equal.
5. The provided error message shows that the `equals` function returned `True` incorrectly.
6. The GitHub issue describes the problem where the `equals` method is returning `True` even when the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tolist(), block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes the creation of tuples based on block content and dtype for comparison. This way, the `equals` function now correctly checks for equality even if the blocks have the same content but different locations.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass as the `equals` function will correctly identify that the DataFrames have different values in columns even if the values are swapped.
