### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their internal attributes like `axes` and `blocks`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different data but the same columns and checks if `equals()` returns `False`, which it should in this case.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the method returned `True` instead of the expected `False`.
5. The corresponding GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where `equals()` wrongly returns `True` even for different block locations.
  
### Bug:
The bug in the `equals()` function arises from not properly considering block locations when comparing `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the blocks based on their characteristics like `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, but it does not account for different block orders. This leads to incorrect results when comparing `BlockManager` instances with the same blocks but in different positions.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to consider block locations while comparing the blocks. One way to ensure correct comparison is to sort the blocks before performing the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks with proper consideration of block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this correction, the `equals()` function should now properly handle comparisons between `BlockManager` instances that have the same blocks with different locations, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
