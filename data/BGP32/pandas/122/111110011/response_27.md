### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The buggy function compares two instances of `BlockManager` class and checks for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different data types in columns and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, which it should.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed as it evaluated to `True is False`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the bug in the `equals` method leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method is caused by the comparison of `blocks` within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug originates from the sorting mechanism used before comparison of the blocks. The sorting key `canonicalize` function involves converting the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to a list, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing blocks with identical data but different internal representations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the sorting key `canonicalize` function should be modified to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their internal representation. By directly comparing the block content without converting to a list, we can ensure that the equality check between blocks is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly using `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` for comparison without involving any transformation of data representations, we can ensure the correct equality check between the two `BlockManager` instances. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
