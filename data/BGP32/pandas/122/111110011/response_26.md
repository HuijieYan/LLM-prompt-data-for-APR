### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in the `test_internals.py` file creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns of different types and values to test the `equals()` method. It expects the method to return `False` because the columns have different data types.
3. The error message shows that the `assert` statement failed because the `equals()` method returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue describes the bug where the `equals()` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the flawed comparison logic within the `equals()` method. It fails to correctly identify when two instances of `BlockManager` have identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect `True` result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class. We should ensure that the comparison properly handles cases where blocks have the same content but are located differently within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._ref_locs, block.values, block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals()` method now properly handles the comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances, taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This fix should resolve the bug and make the `equals()` method return the expected result when comparing instances with different block locations.
