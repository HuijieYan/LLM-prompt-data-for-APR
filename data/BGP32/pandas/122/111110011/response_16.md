### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and block content.
3. The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with the same blocks but different block locations, leading to a failed test.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to consider the block content without depending on the block locations.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.is_datetimelike))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values, x.is_datetimelike))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting key to only consider block content and properties that determine equality, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now correctly compare `BlockManager` instances. This fix should make the failing test pass and address the issue reported on GitHub.
