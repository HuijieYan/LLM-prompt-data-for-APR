### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where identical blocks exist but have different locations.
2. The error likely lies in the logic for canonicalizing and comparing the blocks within the function.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different orders and expects `equals` to return `False`, but due to the bug, it does not.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison considers the block data accurately without being affected by their locations.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `equals` function below.

### Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The changes made include using the `items` attribute of `BlockManager` blocks for sorting instead of the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the blocks are compared based on content rather than location, resolving the bug.

Now, running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
