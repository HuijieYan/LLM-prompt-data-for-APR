### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, which is part of the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on the equality of their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values and asserts that their equality should return False, but it currently returns True.
4. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` method is not working as expected.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the `DataFrame.equals()` method is returning True incorrectly due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation of the `equals` method arises from the comparison logic on the sorted blocks of the `BlockManager`. The failing test provides an example case where the equality check should return False but fails to do so.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the equality comparison logic between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison should correctly identify situations where identical blocks have different locations and return False in those cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals function in BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a key that combines type name and ids
    def block_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    
    # Compare blocks with different locations
    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks with different locations should work correctly, returning False in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
