### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing two DataFrames with different values in columns, and the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames with values that are not equal but the `equals` method is returning `True`.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be an issue in the implementation of the `equals` method where it does not properly handle the case of comparing DataFrames with different values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the blocks of the DataFrames correctly to determine if they are equal.

### Correction:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Previous methods...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
            return False
        
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
        
        return all(
            block.pairwise_equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Explanation:
1. I added a check at the beginning of the method to ensure that `other` is an instance of `BlockManager`.
2. I modified the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the memory address of the blocks using `id(x)` to compare the blocks properly.
3. I replaced the `equals` comparison with a new method `pairwise_equals` which will accurately compare blocks in the DataFrames.
4. This correction should address the issue where the `equals` method was returning `True` incorrectly and should now properly compare the DataFrames. 

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
