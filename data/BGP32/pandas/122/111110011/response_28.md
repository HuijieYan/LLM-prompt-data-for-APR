### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` (presumably representing DataFrames) for equality by sorting and comparing their blocks. 
2. The issue is related to the way blocks are compared, especially when there are unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in a different order and expects `equals` to return `False`, but it fails because the comparison logic doesn't handle this case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider different orders of columns in the DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function which fails to account for different orders of columns in the DataFrames. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the column names along with the dtype name for each block. By considering both the dtype and column names, we can ensure that the comparison is done correctly even when the columns are in a different order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (", ".join(block.dtypes.index), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By including the column names in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version of `equals` function should now correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal even if the columns are in a different order. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
