### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking axes, consolidating blocks, and comparing the blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two dataframes with different values and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
4. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
5. The GitHub issue describes the same problem and the expectation of the result.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `equals` in `BlockManager` class does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. It sorts the blocks based on type name and location but fails to consider the actual values when comparing the blocks.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be updated to consider the actual values in the blocks, not just their type names and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block._reindex(other_blocks[iblock].items).equals(other_blocks[iblock])
        for iblock, block in enumerate(self_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected `equals` function, it should now properly compare the blocks based on their actual values rather than just their type names and locations.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
