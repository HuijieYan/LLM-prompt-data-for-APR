## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` but fails to perform a correct comparison due to the issue in how blocks are compared.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames with swapped columns and expects them to be unequal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns `True`.
3. The bug occurs when the `equals` method in `BlockManager` compares blocks based on the order of their dtype names and manager locations. Due to unconsolidated blocks, the order might differ even if the blocks are the same.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the case where unconsolidated blocks cause the order to vary.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype and data to ensure consistency
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to base the order on the block values and their locations, we ensure consistency in comparing blocks even with varying manager locations, thereby fixing the bug.
