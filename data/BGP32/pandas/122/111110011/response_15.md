### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` using their axes and blocks attributes to determine equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` attempts to compare two different DataFrames that have different data types in the columns but still expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
3. The failing test displays an `AssertionError` because the expected output is `False` but it receives `True`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.
  
### Error Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` method where it sorts the blocks using a canonicalization function that does not consider the case where blocks might have the same content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalization function to consider the actual data content of the blocks for comparison, not just their dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data, not just dtype and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.internal_values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method will compare the actual data values in the blocks for equality, ensuring that even if the blocks have identical content but different locations, the comparison will still yield `False` as expected.
