### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to check for equality between two instances of the same class. However, it fails to differentiate between blocks with identical data but different locations. This results in the function improperly returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have the same data but different column order.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of axes length.
2. Comparison of axes equality.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider the block locations when checking for equality. When two DataFrames have identical data but different block locations (like in the failing test), the function erroneously returns `True` because it compares the blocks solely based on content and not their actual positions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account both the content and the locations of the blocks. One possible approach is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block type, content, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.__array_interface__["data"][0])
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block location as part of the canonicalization process. Now the comparison will properly consider both the content and locations of the blocks when determining equality. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
