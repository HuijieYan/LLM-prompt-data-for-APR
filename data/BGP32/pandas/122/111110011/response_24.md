### Explanation:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if the blocks within them are equal.
- The bug occurs when the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.
- The bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail as it expects the `equals` function to return `False` when the blocks are not equal.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `equals` function's logic where it tries to compare blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison does not take into account the different locations of blocks, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function to include information about block locations or indices. This way, when comparing blocks, the function considers both the type of block and its location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to include block type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now correctly compare blocks and return the expected equality result.
