### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to compare two instances with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns in different order and expects them to be not equal. However, the buggy implementation of `equals` method incorrectly returns True for these cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic in the `equals` method correctly handles cases where the block location is different but the actual data is the same.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.uid: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.uid: block for block in other.blocks}

    return all(self_blocks[block_uid].equals(other_blocks.get(block_uid)) for block_uid in self_blocks)
```

This revised `equals` method now compares blocks by unique identifiers (`uid`) rather than their positions. By using a dictionary to store blocks based on their `uid`, we ensure that the comparison considers blocks with identical data but different locations as equal.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved.
