### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class. This function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in both objects, sorts the blocks, and then checks if each block is equal for both objects.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in a different order and expects them to be not equal. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the fact that the `equals()` method calls `self._consolidate_inplace()` for both objects before comparing their blocks. This causes the blocks to be arranged differently even if they are logically equal, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to prevent the consolidation of blocks before comparing them. We should sort the blocks based on their characteristics directly without altering their positions in memory.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by characteristics for comparison
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    if len(self_blocks_sorted) != len(other_blocks_sorted):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

By directly sorting the blocks without consolidating them before comparison, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
