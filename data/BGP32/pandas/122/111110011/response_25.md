### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances by sorting their blocks and then checking if each block equals the corresponding block in the other instance. The issue seems to be related to the sorting and comparison mechanism for blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames with different values for columns `'a'` and `'b`, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing because `True is False`, meaning the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly handles cases where identical blocks have different locations.
5. We should modify the comparison mechanism to handle these cases specifically.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the comparison mechanism in the `equals` function not correctly handling cases where identical blocks have different locations. The comparison logic is based on sorting blocks and checking their equality, which fails when blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison mechanism within the `equals` function to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. One possible approach is to compare the values within blocks directly while maintaining the order of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the `values` within blocks directly instead of sorting blocks based on block type and locations. This approach ensures that we compare the actual values in blocks, handling cases where identical blocks may have different locations. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the `equals` function work as expected for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
