### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class for equality. However, it is erroneously returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations. This issue was reported on GitHub with a failing test that demonstrates the problem.

### Error:
The `equals()` function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation of the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class does not account for the possibility of identical blocks having different locations due to how the blocks are compared. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to appropriately handle the comparison of blocks with the same data but different locations. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks to ensure they are compared in a consistent order. This way, even if the blocks are in different locations internally, they will be considered equal if their data is the same.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes the block type and locations, the corrected function should now properly compare the blocks for equality even if they have different internal locations. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
