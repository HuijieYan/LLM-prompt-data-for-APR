### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column order to test the equality check.
3. The error message from the failing test shows that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion fails, indicating that the `equals()` method incorrectly returns True instead of False.

### Identified Issue:
1. The bug occurs because the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class does not handle cases where the block locations are different but the contents are the same.

### Suggested Fix:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` method to compare blocks based on their content, regardless of their location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_numeric_data().values.tolist()
    other_blocks = other.get_numeric_data().values.tolist()

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` method compares the numeric blocks of the BlockManager instances for equality directly, resolving the issue where blocks with different locations but identical content were not considered equal.
