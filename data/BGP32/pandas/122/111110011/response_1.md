### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`, check if their axes are equal, consolidate them in place, sort the blocks, and then compare the blocks one by one.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame instances with columns `a` and `b` in a different order and then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False.
3. The error message shows that the comparison is returning True instead of False, indicating that the buggy function is not correctly handling the comparison of DataFrame blocks with different locations.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the bug occurs when comparing DataFrame blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the failure of the `BlockManager.equals` function to properly account for DataFrame blocks with identical content but different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly handle the scenario where blocks are identical but in different locations. One approach could be to update the `canonicalize` function or adjust the block comparison process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values_hash())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version enhances the `canonicalize` function to include the hash values of the block values in addition to the dtype name. By using the `get_values_hash()` method, we ensure that even if the blocks are in different locations but have the same content, they will be correctly identified as equal.
