### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It first checks if their axes have the same lengths and then compares the individual blocks in a specific order.

2. **Error Location**: The error in the function seems to be related to how it compares the blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects.

3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects. The function compares blocks based on their data type and manager locations. However, in the failing test case, the function returns `True` instead of `False` because the blocks have identical data but in different locations. This does not align with the intended logic of the function, leading to the failure.

4. **Strategy for Fixing Bug**: To resolve the bug, we should modify the comparison logic of the blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing blocks based on data type and manager locations, we need to compare them more strictly to ensure that the data contents match exactly.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare each block in the same order
    for block_idx in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[block_idx].equals(other_blocks[block_idx]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks in `BlockManager` objects strictly by comparing each block individually to ensure they match exactly.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass successfully.
