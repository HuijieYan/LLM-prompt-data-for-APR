### Explanation:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating the blocks within each object, sorting them based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, and finally checking if the sorted blocks are equal.

### Issues:
1. The comparison logic is flawed, as it only compares the shapes of the axes and then proceeds to consolidate the blocks before comparing them, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The merging of blocks before the comparison may lead to internal changes and false positives in equality checks.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Compare the axes of both objects first without consolidating the blocks.
2. If the axes are equal, then proceed to compare the blocks directly without consolidation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison will directly check the axes equality and then directly compare the blocks without consolidation, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread and resolving the failing test case.
