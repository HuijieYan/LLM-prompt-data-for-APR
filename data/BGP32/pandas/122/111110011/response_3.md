### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas` library. It compares two block managers for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be in the comparison logic of self and other axes, the consolidation of blocks, and the comparison of individual blocks.
3. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` even when the axes and blocks of the two block managers are not equal. This leads to failing tests like `test_dataframe_not_equal` which expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but due to the bug, it returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is correct and comprehensive. This involves verifying the equality of axes, consolidating blocks for both self and other managers, sorting blocks before comparison, and comparing individual blocks correctly.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By fixing the comparison logic and sorting blocks based on dtype and locations, this corrected version should resolve the issue of `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
