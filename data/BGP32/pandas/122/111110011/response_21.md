### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks if the shapes of the axes are the same, then consolidates the blocks in each manager and sorts the blocks before comparing them for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, due to the bug in the `equals` function, the comparison wrongly returns `True`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the bug causes the comparison to return `True`, leading to the test failure.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where the bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function compares the blocks correctly and returns the expected result.

### Updated `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_canonical = [(b.block.values, b.values[0], b.dtype) for b in self.blocks]
    other_canonical = [(b.block.values, b.values[0], b.dtype) for b in other.blocks]

    return self_canonical == other_canonical
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to store the actual block values in `self_canonical` and `other_canonical`, we ensure that blocks specifically are being compared correctly rather than just the order. This change should address the bug and make the function return the expected results.
