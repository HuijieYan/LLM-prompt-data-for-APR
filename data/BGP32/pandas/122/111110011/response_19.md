### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates the data in both instances, and finally compares the blocks from both instances.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
4. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by not handling unconsolidated blocks properly, resulting in incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them to avoid issues with unconsolidated blocks affecting the equality check between two instances of the `BlockManager` class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        block._consolidate_inplace()  # Consolidate the block before comparison
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consolidating the blocks before comparison and ensuring that unconsolidated blocks do not affect the equality check, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
