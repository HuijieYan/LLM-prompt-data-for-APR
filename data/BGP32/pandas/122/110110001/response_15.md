### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class, responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two different DataFrame instances and compares them using the `equals` method, which should return `False` if the DataFrames are not equal.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`, which means the `equals` method is not functioning correctly.
- The issue seems to be with how the blocks are being compared within the `equals` method.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` method.
2. The method used to canonicalize blocks for comparison purposes.
3. Sorting of blocks for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. The method is sorting the blocks using a custom key `canonicalize`, which combines the type name and locations of blocks. If the block order is different between the two `BlockManager` instances being compared, the method may incorrectly return `True`, indicating the instances are equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between blocks is done in a consistent manner disregarding their order. One way to achieve this is by iterating over each block rather than relying on block order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_sorted_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_sorted_blocks()
    
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other_blocks) for block in self_blocks
    )
    
def get_sorted_blocks(self):
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    return sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
```

By iterating over each block in `self_blocks` and checking if it matches with any block in `other_blocks`, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by the order of blocks. The `get_sorted_blocks` function sorts the blocks consistently based on the key `canonicalize`, ensuring a reliable comparison mechanism.
