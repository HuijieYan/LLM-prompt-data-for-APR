### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method and expects them to be not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` method where the ordering of columns in the DataFrames is not properly handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not consider the order of columns when comparing two DataFrames. The comparison is based on the order of blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists, which can lead to incorrect results when the columns are in a different order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances or DataFrames considers the columns in the correct order. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks based on the column order before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column order for correct comparison
    def get_column_names(blocks):
        return [block_items[0] for block_items in blocks[0].items]

    self_column_names = get_column_names(self.blocks)
    other_column_names = get_column_names(other.blocks)

    if self_column_names != other_column_names:
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected version, we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on the column order for comparison. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method work correctly for comparing two `BlockManager` instances or DataFrames.
