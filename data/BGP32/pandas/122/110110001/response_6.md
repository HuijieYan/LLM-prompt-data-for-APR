### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is meant to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and block data.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two different DataFrames with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different order of data. Then it asserts that the `equals` method of the DataFrames should return `False`.
3. The error message shows an assertion error because the `equals` method of the DataFrame is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug is likely related to how the function is comparing the axes and blocks for equality. The issue could be in the logic used to sort the blocks before comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function compares the axes correctly and sorts the blocks consistently.

### Correction:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After replacing the buggy `equals` function with the corrected version provided above, the function should be able to compare the `BlockManager` instances correctly, addressing the issue and passing the failing test.
