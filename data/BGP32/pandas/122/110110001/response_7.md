### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method defined within the `BlockManager` class.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns swapped and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, which is expected to return `False`.
- The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the actual result (`True`) was not equal to the expected result (`False`). This suggests that the `equals` method is not correctly handling the comparison between the two dataframes.

### Issues:
1. The `equals` method of `BlockManager` is comparing the internal properties of the object instead of the actual content.
2. The sorting and canonicalization of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` are not sufficient for comparing the equality of DataFrame objects.

### Bug Cause:
The `equals` method is comparing the internal block properties of the `BlockManager` objects instead of comparing the content of the DataFrame. This leads to incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames where the order of the values in columns is different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `equals` method to compare the actual content of the DataFrames instead of internal block properties.
2. Use a direct comparison of the values in each dataframe to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    for col in self.axes[1]:  # Assuming columns are always in second axis
        if list(self[col]) != list(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated version compares the shape of the two DataFrames first and then compares each column in the DataFrames directly by converting them into lists for comparison. If any column does not match, the function returns `False`. If all columns match, it returns `True` indicating equality.
