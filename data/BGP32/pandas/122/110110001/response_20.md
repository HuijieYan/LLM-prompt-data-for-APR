### Analysis:
1. The `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file contains a `equals` method that compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values and expects them to be unequal.
3. The error message indicates that the equality comparison (`assert df1.equals(df2) is False`) is failing because it returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug seems to be in how the `canonicalize` function is handling the ordering of blocks for comparison.
  
### Bug Cause:
1. The error is likely occurring because the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function is not working correctly, leading to incorrect results in the equality comparison.
2. In the failing test, the two `DataFrame` objects have different values for column `a` and `b`, which should make them unequal. However, due to the incorrect sorting in the `equals` method, they are incorrectly considered equal.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, correct the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper ordering of blocks for comparison.
2. Modify the `equals` method to handle the comparison of blocks accurately based on their sorted order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block type and locations information properly, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now compare the `BlockManager` objects correctly based on their blocks, resolving the bug.
