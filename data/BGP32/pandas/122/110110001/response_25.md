### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing the blocks within them. The function sorts the blocks based on type name and block locations for canonicalization before comparing.
2. The failing test function creates two Pandas DataFrames with different values in columns 'a' and 'b' and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method of Pandas DataFrames.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True is False` when comparing the DataFrames created in the test.
4. The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to comparing the DataFrames based on their content without considering the order or type of data.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames based on sorted values and types.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames by sorting the data before performing the equality check.
2. Sort the DataFrames based on columns and values before comparison.
3. Update the function to return `True` only if all the sorted blocks are equal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on types and values before comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
