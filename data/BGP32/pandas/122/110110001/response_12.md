### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and content.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data types for columns `'a'` and `'b'`, then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`.
4. The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` method where it compares the sorted blocks of the `BlockManager` objects directly without taking into consideration the column-wise comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the contents of the blocks in addition to the block order.
2. We should iterate over the columns and compare the corresponding blocks of the columns to ensure accurate comparison.
3. Sorting the blocks should still be done to ensure consistent comparison of the data frames.

### Corrected Version of `equals` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.astype(str).values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks column-wise
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class will compare the contents of the blocks column-wise, ensuring accurate comparison of `BlockManager` objects. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
