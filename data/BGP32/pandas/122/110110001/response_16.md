### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The error message indicates that the equality comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) is not working as expected. It seems to be asserting that `df1` is equal to `df2`, which is not the case.
4. The bug likely lies in the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The method is comparing two sets of blocks in a DataFrame. Since the comparison logic inside `equals` does not consider the content of the pandas DataFrame correctly, it leads to the incorrect result.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class compares the blocks directly without considering the content of the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, but this does not account for the actual values in the blocks when determining equality.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values within the blocks of the DataFrames and ensure consistent sorting for comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        (self_block == other_block).all() for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By extracting the values of the blocks and comparing them element-wise using `(self_block == other_block).all()`, we ensure that the values within the blocks are compared correctly for equality. This correction should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` method functions correctly for DataFrame comparison.
