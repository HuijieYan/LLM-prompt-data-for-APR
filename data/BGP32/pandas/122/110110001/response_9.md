### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file of the Pandas test suite tries to assert that two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the two DataFrames are being considered equal when they are expected to be different.
4. The bug is likely in the implementation of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It seems to be comparing the blocks based on their memory locations, which might not be correct for comparing the actual content of the DataFrames.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method to compare the block content instead of their memory locations.

### Solution:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtypes.to_dict()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version above, the `canonicalize` function now extracts the block data types as a dictionary instead of relying on memory locations. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, making the `equals` method more reliable for comparing DataFrames.
