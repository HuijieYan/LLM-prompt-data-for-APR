### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py`.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the equality comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method.
3. The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, due to a bug in the `equals` method, it is not returning the correct result.
4. The bug stems from the fact that the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns of different types in a different order. The `equals` method fails to handle this correctly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to correctly handle DataFrames with columns in different orders and of different types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Sort the columns of the DataFrames before performing the equality check.
2. Check if the shape of the DataFrames is the same before proceeding with the equality comparison.
3. Check the equality of the columns after sorting.
4. Return `False` if any of the comparisons fail.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Sort columns to handle columns of different types and different order
    columns_order_self = sorted(self.axes[1])
    columns_order_other = sorted(other.axes[1])
    
    # Check if shapes are the same
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    
    # Check if columns are the same
    if columns_order_self != columns_order_other:
        return False

    # Check equality of data blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtypes, x.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtypes, x.index))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `equals` method with the corrected version above, the method should now be able to correctly handle DataFrames with columns of different types in different orders and pass the failing test.
