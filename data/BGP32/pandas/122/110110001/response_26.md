### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is testing the behavior of `df1.equals(df2)` where `df1` and `df2` are two `DataFrame` objects with different data.
3. The failing test is asserting that the result of `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`, but the current implementation of the `equals` method is not correctly handling the comparison of the two `DataFrame` objects.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the equality of blocks is determined and how the sorting is done in the `equals` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the blocks are compared for equality. The `canonicalize` function tries to sort the blocks by their data type and location. This sorting logic is incorrect, as it may not always match the assumed equality between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the way blocks are compared for equality. Each block should be checked for equality directly without sorting them based on their type and location. We should iterate over the blocks in the order they appear in the original blocks list.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Directly compare block equality without sorting
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
        )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will directly compare each block of the two `BlockManager` objects for equality without sorting them by type and location. This should fix the bug and make the method correctly compare the two `BlockManager` objects.
