The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

### Error Analysis:
1. The error in the function is that it incorrectly compares the data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises from block comparison where the dtypes and locations of blocks are not compared correctly.
2. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same structure are created. The assertion checks if `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`.
3. The error message states that the actual comparison result is `True`, which is incorrect. This is because the `equals` function is not implemented correctly to handle the comparison of blocks with different values.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to enhance the block comparison logic within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison should be based on the values within the blocks rather than just the attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Modify the canonicalization to include block values
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block values and updating the comparison inside the `all` function to compare block values, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of `BlockManager` instances.
