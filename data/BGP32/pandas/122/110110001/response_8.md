### Analysis:
- The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method, but the comparison is failing.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because the objects are considered equal when they are not supposed to be.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` method.
2. The block consolidation before comparison.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by an issue with how the `equals` method handles the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances. It seems that the comparison logic is not correctly checking for equality based on the underlying data structure, leading to the incorrect result in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison in the `equals` method correctly checks for equality based on the data within the `BlockManager` objects.
2. Make sure that any necessary preprocessing (like block consolidation or sorting) is done before comparison.
3. Debug the `BlockManager` class to identify any inconsistencies or errors in the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the block consolidation is done before comparison, and the comparison logic compares the blocks properly to determine equality between two `BlockManager` instances. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
