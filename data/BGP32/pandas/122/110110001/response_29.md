### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
- The `equals` method is used to check whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` which is checking for inequality between two DataFrames.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True is False`.

### Potential Error:
- The `equals` method is not comparing the actual data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects, but is only comparing the axes and the dtype of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
- The `equals` method compares the axis and dtype of the internal blocks, but it does not check the actual values within those blocks. Therefore, even if the internal data blocks are different, it might return `True` if the axes and dtype match.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
- Modify the `equals` method to compare the actual values within the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects.
- Update the comparison processes to involve verifying the equality of the actual data within the internal blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by actual data values
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

Now, the corrected `equals` method compares the actual data values within the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the equality check includes the internal data and not just axes and dtype. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
