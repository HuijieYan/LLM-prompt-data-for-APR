### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. **Buggy Class Docs**: The `BlockManager` class manages labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays for DataFrame and Series.
3. **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in columns "a" and "b" and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method.
4. **Error Message**: The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not returning a predictable and unique value for each block. When comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the sorting might not be done correctly based on the dtype names and `mgr_locs` due to unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function produces a unique and predictable key for each block. This could involve including additional properties of the block that can distinguish it uniquely. Alternatively, we can modify the equality check method to directly compare the block properties rather than relying on sorting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1._is_equal(block2)

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I replaced the block comparison with a custom `block_equals` function that directly compares the blocks based on the `_is_equal` method (which is hypothetical for demonstration). This way, we can ensure that the comparison is done accurately without relying on sorting.
