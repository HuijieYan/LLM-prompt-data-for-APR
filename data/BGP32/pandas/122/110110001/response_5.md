### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` from the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is trying to assert that two different DataFrames are not equal by using the `equals()` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because `assert True is False`, which means that the `equals()` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The bug is likely in the logic of comparing individual blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way blocks are compared within the `equals()` method. The comparison of blocks is not done correctly, leading to wrong evaluation of equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, we compare the blocks within them correctly. One possible solution is to compare the sorted blocks based on their type name and location within the manager.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After fixing the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class, the corrected version should ensure that two `BlockManager` objects are compared correctly based on their blocks. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
