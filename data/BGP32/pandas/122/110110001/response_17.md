### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two pandas DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in columns `a` and `b`, and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug is likely occurring in the `equals` function due to incorrect comparison logic or ordering of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the comparison logic between the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. Ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparison.
3. Verify that the axes are compared properly.
4. Make necessary adjustments to ensure that the equality comparison works as expected.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.ftype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of `BlockManager` objects based on axes and blocks should work correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
