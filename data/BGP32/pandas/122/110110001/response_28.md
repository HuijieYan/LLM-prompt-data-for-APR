### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is attempting to check whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the test file is trying to assert that two DataFrames are not equal, but the equality check with the `equals` function is failing.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is evaluating to `True is False`.
4. The bug is likely due to how the two DataFrames are compared within the `equals` function of `BlockManager`. It seems that the issue could be related to how the blocks are being compared or sorted.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks in a consistent way to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. The issue might be with how the blocks are being sorted and checked for equality within the function. We should ensure that the sorting mechanism is reliable and compares the blocks effectively.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the axes and then the blocks, sorting them based on type and values, and checking their equality in the corrected version of the `equals` function should fix the bug and ensure that the equality check between two `BlockManager` objects is accurate.
