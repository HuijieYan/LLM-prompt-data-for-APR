1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class within the `managers.py` file is the `equals` method, which is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file is checking if two `DataFrame` objects are not equal, which relies on the `equals` method provided by `BlockManager`.

2. The potential error in the `equals` method lies in the sorting of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. If the data in the blocks is not in a proper order, this sorting might cause issues when comparing blocks.

3. The error occurs due to the fact that the equality check involves sorting the blocks in a way that may cause incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This leads to the error message indicating that `True` is being compared with `False`, which is not the expected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done in a way that does not introduce any inconsistency in the comparison process. One way to achieve this is by comparing the blocks directly without sorting them, as the order of blocks should not affect the equality check.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks without sorting them, ensuring a proper equality check between two `BlockManager` objects. With this modification, the failing test should pass successfully.
