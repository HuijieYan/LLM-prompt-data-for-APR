### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals()` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is testing the equality of two DataFrames using the `equals()` method, which is resulting in an assertion error.
- The error message indicates that the equality comparison is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`, leading to the test failure.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies within the implementation of the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class.
- The method is not handling the comparison of DataFrames correctly, resulting in a false positive when comparing two DataFrames that are actually not equal.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by comparing DataFrames directly within the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class.
- The method is not designed to correctly compare two DataFrames, hence the incorrect result.
- The sorting of blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs` may not be necessary for DataFrame equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of relying on the `equals()` method for DataFrames within the `BlockManager` class, a new approach should be taken to compare DataFrames effectively.
- The comparison logic should be updated to compare the values within the DataFrames directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare DataFrame values
    self_values = pd.concat([block.values for block in self.blocks], ignore_index=True)
    other_values = pd.concat([block.values for block in other.blocks], ignore_index=True)

    return self_values.equals(other_values)
```

### Corrections Made:
- Updated the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class to compare the concatenated values of both DataFrames directly.
- Concatenated the block values of each DataFrame to compare them accurately.
- Removed the sorting of blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`, as it is not necessary for DataFrame equality comparison.
