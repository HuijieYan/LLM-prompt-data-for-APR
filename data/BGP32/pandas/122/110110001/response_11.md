### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking various components like `axes`, `blocks`, etc.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and expects them to be not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the two DataFrames were considered equal when they should not be based on the test logic.
4. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function that does not correctly handle the comparison of the values within the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare the values within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

With the corrected implementation, the `equals` function will now compare the values within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances instead of comparing the blocks directly. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
