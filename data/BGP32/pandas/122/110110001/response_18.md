### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file 'pandas/core/internals/managers.py'.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in 'pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py' is failing with an assertion error as the `equals` method is not providing the expected result.
3. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, which have different data types in their columns and expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return False.
4. The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks based on their data types and locations rather than their actual values.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The `equals` method should compare blocks based on their actual data values instead of their types and locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on their index locations for comparison.
3. Update the `canonicalize` function to extract and sort the block values for comparison.
4. Modify the comparison logic to check for equality based on the sorted block values.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison will be done based on the actual data values of the blocks, allowing for correct comparison of DataFrames with different data type column values.
