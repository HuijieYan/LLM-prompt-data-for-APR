### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` creates two dataframes with different values for the columns.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug is likely in the `equals` method implementation when comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager`.
   
### Bug:
The bug is likely occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class when comparing blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The method fails to properly compare the data blocks resulting in unexpected `True` value, leading to the failing test.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are compared in the `equals` method. We need to ensure that the equality comparison is done correctly for each block in both `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks using a suitable method (such as comparing `dtypes` and `mgr_locs`), the corrected version of the `equals` method should now properly compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
