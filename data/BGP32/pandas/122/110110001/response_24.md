### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and other properties are the same.
   
2. **Test Code:** The failing test is checking if the `equals` function correctly identifies that two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) are not equal.
   
3. **Error Message:** The error message indicates that the assertion fails with `True is False`, highlighting that the two DataFrames are considered equal incorrectly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the comparison process within the `equals` function. Since the code is comparing the blocks without considering the actual data within the blocks, it fails to correctly identify when the contents of the DataFrames are not equal.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The current implementation of `canonicalize` only considers the type name and `mgr_locs`, which are not sufficient to determine the equality of the blocks when comparing DataFrames. Additionally, the `equals` method should not be directly comparing two `BlockManager` instances, but rather should compare the data inside the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. We should iterate over the blocks and check the equality of each block's data directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block data directly
    return all(
        pd.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now compare the actual data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the equality check considers the content of the DataFrames rather than just their structure.
