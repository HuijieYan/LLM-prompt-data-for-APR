### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, it is currently not working correctly and causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.
2. The error in the `equals` function seems to stem from the comparison logic where it is sorting the blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations, which might not be correct for comparing two `DataFrame` objects.
   
### Error Cause:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is using a sorting mechanism based on block properties like dtype name and manager locations to compare two instances. This approach is incorrect for comparing `DataFrame` objects since they should be compared based on the values and labels of the data they contain. This leads to inaccurate comparisons and the test failure.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the contents of the `DataFrame` objects instead of the internal block properties. The comparison should be based on the data values and columns/rows of the `DataFrame` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    self_values = self.values
    other_values = other.values
    return np.array_equal(self_values, other_values)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the shapes of the two `DataFrame` objects are the same.
- Then we check if the row and column labels (index and columns) are equal.
- Finally, we compare the values contained in the `DataFrame` objects using NumPy's `array_equal` function to ensure equality.
- This approach correctly compares the content of the `DataFrame` objects for equality.
