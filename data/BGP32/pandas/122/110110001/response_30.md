### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the file `managers.py`.
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if the `equals` method behaves as expected on two DataFrames with different data.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it compares `True` to `False`, suggesting that the `equals` method is not working correctly.
4. The bug might be related to how the function is comparing the blocks of the two dataframes.

### Bug Cause:
The issue is likely occurring when comparing the blocks of the dataframes in the `equals` function. The implementation of the `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of the blocks, resulting in incorrect evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `equals` function, specifically the comparison of individual blocks. Ensure that the sorting and comparison logic for blocks is correctly implemented to identify any differences between the two dataframes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())  # Change to indexer

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))  # Compare block values
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function and comparing the block values directly, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly compare two DataFrames. This correction should address the bug reported and make the failing test pass.
