### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, but it fails.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`.
- The error message suggests that the `NDFrame.equals` method is being called on the two DataFrames, and the comparison is inconsistent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be returning consistent values for block canonicalization.
2. The way blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` function could be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to occur in the `equals` method when comparing two BlockManagers. The inconsistency arises due to the sorting and comparison of blocks based on the canonicalization function. The sorting order and the `equals` comparison of blocks do not properly account for the differences between the two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly in the `equals` method. This involves checking the equality of the axes, consolidating the blocks, sorting the blocks based on a consistent canonicalization function, and then comparing each pair of blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts().items(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison of two BlockManagers should be done correctly, ensuring that the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes without any assertion errors.
