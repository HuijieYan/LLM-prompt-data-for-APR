#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas` library.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` compares two `DataFrame` objects and expects them to not be equal based on mismatched values in columns.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because `True` is being compared to `False`, pointing to an issue with the `equals` method not correctly identifying inequality between the two `DataFrames`.
4. The bug appears to be caused by the `equals` method not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different values in columns properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to handle the comparison of blocks with different values.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle blocks with different values. We can achieve this by adding a check to compare the actual values in the blocks.
2. Update the `equals` method to use the modified `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the blocks in different DataFrames.

#### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now compares the values in the block along with `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to ensure correct comparison of blocks. This modification helps to accurately compare DataFrames based on their content.
