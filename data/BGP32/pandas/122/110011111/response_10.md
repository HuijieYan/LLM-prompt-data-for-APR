### Fixing the Bug

#### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal by comparing the axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed as it does not handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

#### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks are in different locations within the BlockManager objects.
2. Modify the canonicalization process to ensure that the equality comparison considers the actual block data rather than just the location.

#### Updated/Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly to handle identical blocks in different locations
    self_block_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, other_block_data[i]) for i, block_data in enumerate(self_block_data)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the actual block data within the BlockManager objects is compared for equality, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations.

By using `np.array_equal()` to compare the block data directly, the function now correctly handles scenarios where blocks are the same but in different locations.

This fix aligns with the expectation that the `equals()` function should return `False` when comparing two BlockManager objects with identical blocks but different locations.
