### Bug Explanation
The bug is related to the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises when the function is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, specifically when sorting the blocks based on their type name and location. Due to the way the blocks are sorted, the comparison results in `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism for the blocks needs to be adjusted to consider the block content rather than just the type name and location. By comparing the actual data within the blocks, we can ensure that the `equals` function produces the correct result based on the content of the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block.values))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block.values))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content, allowing for a proper comparison between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison now takes into account the actual block values rather than just their type name and location.
