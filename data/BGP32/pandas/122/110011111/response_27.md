### Fixing the Bug

#### Bug Explanation:
The code is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the bug arises when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The issue is that the comparison function does not consider the block locations, resulting in incorrect equality comparison.

#### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle the block comparison. We should consider both the block type names and manager locations to ensure a correct equality check between blocks.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by considering both the block type names and manager locations for comparison. Now, the equality check between `BlockManager` instances should work as expected.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue should now pass, returning the expected output of `False` for the `df3.equals(df4)` comparison.
