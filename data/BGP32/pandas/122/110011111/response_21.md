### Bug Fix
The bug in the `equals` function stems from sorting the blocks based on their dtype names and locations, causing the comparison to fail for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

To fix this issue, we need to sort the blocks based on dtype alone.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fixing the equals function in the BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the dtype to ensure consistent sorting for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing only based on the dtype of the blocks, we ensure that equivalent DataFrames with blocks in different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
