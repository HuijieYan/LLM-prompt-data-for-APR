### Bug Fix

#### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class where it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different block locations. The issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames.

#### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `equals` function not correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.
- Due to the incorrect order of the blocks, the function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to test failures.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks is consistent between the two DataFrames being compared. By sorting the blocks based on a canonical tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs`, we can guarantee that the comparison is accurate.

### Updated Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison of DataFrames with different block locations will now correctly return `False` as expected. This adjustment addresses the bug reported on GitHub, ensuring the `equals` function behaves as intended.
