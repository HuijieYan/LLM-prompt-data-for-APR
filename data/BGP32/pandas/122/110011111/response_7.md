### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with identical data but different locations, leading to a false positive result (returning `True` instead of the expected `False`).

The root cause of the bug lies in how the function handles the comparison of blocks. It fails to account for the actual data contents of the blocks and instead relies on comparing the structure of the blocks. This causes blocks with identical data but different locations to be considered different.

To resolve this, the function needs to ensure that it compares the actual data within the blocks, not just their structures, to accurately determine equality.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, it needs to compare the data content of the blocks instead of only their structures. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic within the function. By comparing the data values directly, we can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by iterating over them and checking for equality
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, each block is compared directly for equality by checking their data content. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
