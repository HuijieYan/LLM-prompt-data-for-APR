### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class stems from the comparison logic between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises when comparing the blocks inside each `BlockManager`. The comparison logic does not consider the order of the blocks, leading to a false positive result when comparing blocks with different locations but the same content.

The error message indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` when comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have different values but with the same columns. This behavior goes against the expected output, as the DataFrames are not equal in terms of content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, it is necessary to modify the comparison logic to consider the contents of the blocks in order, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize and sort blocks based on dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block_values.equals(other_block_values) 
        for block_values, other_block_values in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on their locations and values, ensuring a consistent comparison between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison should now correctly reflect the equality based on block contents and locations.
