### Bug analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks the axes of the BlockManagers and then the blocks themselves. The issue arises from inaccurate comparison of blocks due to variations in locations.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function erroneously returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The bug is caused by not considering the mgr_locs (locations of the blocks) when sorting the blocks for comparison. As a result, identical blocks with different locations can be mistakenly flagged as unequal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the blocks are sorted and compared in the `equals` function to properly account for block locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include mgr_locs along with dtype for more accurate block comparison.
2. Update the sorting process of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by incorporating the comparisons based on both dtype and mgr_locs.
3. After sorting, compare the blocks using `equals` method to determine the equality accurately.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
      
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By incorporating the mgr_locs when sorting the blocks, the corrected function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances based on both dtype and block locations to determine their equality.
