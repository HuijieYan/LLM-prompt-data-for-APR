### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances without considering the locations of the blocks. The function wrongly returns `True` when blocks have the same data but are stored in a different location within the `BlockManager`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison accounts for the actual content of the blocks irrespective of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block._consolidate() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block._consolidate() for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances are consolidated by calling `_consolidate()` on each block before comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal.
2. The comparison is now based on the consolidated blocks, thus resolving the issue with the wrong `True` return.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly return `False` for the provided dataframes in the test case mentioned in the GitHub Issue.
