### Bug Explanation

The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly returns `True` when two `BlockManager` objects have identical blocks but in different locations.

The issue is identified in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple using the dtype name and block locations to ensure consistent sorting. However, this approach fails to correctly compare blocks that are identical but have different positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should not rely on their ordering but rather on their content. The `equals` function should directly compare corresponding blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting them, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle cases where blocks have identical content but different locations.
