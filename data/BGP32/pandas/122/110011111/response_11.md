### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare the equality of two instances based on their attributes.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the comparison returned `True` incorrectly.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks within the instances are compared for equality.
4. The comparison involves sorting the blocks by type and locations, which could lead to the wrong result if the blocks have the same data but in different locations.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of blocks to ensure that the comparison considers the data within the blocks and not just their type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the `values` of the blocks rather than just the types and locations, the corrected version ensures a proper comparison of the data within the blocks, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
