### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class where the equality of two `BlockManager` instances is checked. The issue arises due to the comparison of blocks in two different orders, resulting in mistakenly returning `True` when the blocks are actually not equal based on their content and locations.

In the failing test case provided:
- Two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` are created with columns having different data types in a different order.
- The `equals` function is called on `df1` and `df2`, expecting `False`.
- The comparison erroneously returns `True`, triggering the assertion error.

The root cause of the bug lies in the ordering of blocks during comparison. Sorting the blocks before comparison based on a canonicalized key needs to be implemented to ensure that equivalent block types are lined up correctly for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance before comparing them. This sorting should be based on a canonical form to ensure that blocks are ordered consistently for accurate comparison. We will update the `equals` function to sort both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before the comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a canonicalize function to sort blocks consistently for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple((block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice()) for block in block)
    
    # Sort the blocks within each BlockManager instance
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance will be sorted before comparison, resolving the issue of blocks having identical content but different locations being incorrectly considered as equal.
