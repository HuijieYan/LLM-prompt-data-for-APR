### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises when checking the equality of blocks within each `BlockManager`. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing blocks with different locations but the same data.

The failing test case provides two `DataFrame` objects with different data in each column. The test asserts that the `equals` function should return `False` since the data in the columns is not the same.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs when the function compares the blocks inside each `BlockManager`.
2. The function uses the `equals` method of each block, which does not consider the possibility of blocks with identical data but different locations being treated as equal.
3. This results in the function erroneously returning `True` for cases where two `BlockManagers` have blocks with different locations but the same data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. We should not rely solely on the block's equality based on dtype and mgr_locs. Instead, we should compare the actual block data to ensure correctness.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version compares the block data by converting the block values to a `bytes` object for comparison, ensuring that blocks with different locations but identical data are correctly recognized as different.
