### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship with Buggy Class**: The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file.
   
2. **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be in the `equals` function where it compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug results in the incorrect comparison of `BlockManager` instances due to a misalignment in block order checking.
   - The error message highlights that the equality check between two dataframes is returning `True` but is expected to return `False`.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - The issue is a result of not correctly comparing the blocks of `BlockManager` objects. To fix it:
     - Sort the blocks based on a canonicalize function that ensures blocks are ordered correctly for comparison.
     - Update the equality check to compare sorted blocks and fix the misalignment. 

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly align and compare blocks of `BlockManager` objects, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
