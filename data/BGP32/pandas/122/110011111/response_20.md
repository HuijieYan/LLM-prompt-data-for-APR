The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in a non-canonical order due to the sorting step based on block type and location. The issue stems from the fact that when sorting blocks, it doesn't consider the data within the blocks. The `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` do not match in the respective `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. 

To fix this bug, one possible strategy is to sort the blocks based on both type and the actual data within the blocks, rather than just the type and location. This way, the blocks will be compared correctly based on the actual content they hold.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to consider block data for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, blocks are now sorted based on their values, type, and location, ensuring that the comparison between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects returns the correct result.
