### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the sorting method used to compare the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.

When comparing blocks, the function sorts the blocks based on a combination of the type name and manager locations. However, in some cases, due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks, the blocks might appear equal but have different manager locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison method in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Instead of solely relying on sorting based on block type and manager locations, we should compare the blocks directly. This change will ensure that even unconsolidated blocks with different locations are correctly identified as non-equal.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances, the corrected function will properly handle the comparison even when blocks have different locations due to unconsolidated states. This modification should resolve the bug indicated in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
