### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug seems to be related to mistakenly returning `True` when the two objects are actually not equal.

1. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then it consolidates the blocks within each object and finally compares the blocks for equality.
2. The issue arises from how blocks are compared for equality after consolidation, causing the function to return `True` instead of `False` when the blocks have the same values but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks for equality takes into account not only the values within the blocks but also their locations. This approach will prevent the function from incorrectly returning `True` in cases where blocks have identical values but different positions.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure blocks are equal based on values and positions
    def equal_blocks(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda oblock: (oblock.dtype.name, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(equal_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function now verifies the equality of blocks not only based on values but also by considering their locations. This change addresses the initial bug where the function incorrectly returned `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
