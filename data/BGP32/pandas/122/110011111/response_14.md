### Bug Explanation:
The buggy `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the blocks inside the `BlockManager` objects. The issue is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks when the order changes but the content remains the same. This issue is leading to incorrect equality checks for `BlockManager` objects, resulting in failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic for blocks inside `BlockManager` objects. Instead of relying on the order of blocks for equality checks, we should compare the content of each block to ensure their equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks contents, not the order
    self_block_dict = {block._id: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_dict = {block._id: block for block in other.blocks}

    return all(
        block_id in other_block_dict
        and self_block_dict[block_id].equals(other_block_dict[block_id])
        for block_id in self_block_dict
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We create dictionaries of block IDs mapping to blocks for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects.
- We then iterate over the block IDs of the `self` blocks, check if the block ID exists in the `other` blocks, and compare the blocks' content using `equals` method.
- This approach ensures that the comparison is based on the block content rather than the block order.

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test case.
