### Analysis:
1. **Bug**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to properly check for equality when the blocks have different positions.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug occurs in the `equals` function where the blocks are being compared in a loop. The comparison is based on the order of blocks, which can be different even for identical blocks.

3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The error arises because the function assumes that sorting the blocks by `canonicalize` will ensure equality. However, `canonicalize` is based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which may not be sufficient to distinguish blocks.
   - The issue is related to the order of these blocks, leading to false positives in cases where blocks are equivalent but positioned differently.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Modify the comparison logic to ensure that blocks are truly equal, regardless of their order or positions.
   - Consider equality at a block level rather than overall order.

### Bug-Fixed Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.shape)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.shape)

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By updating the comparison logic to individually compare blocks within the `BlockManager`, the fixed function will accurately determine equality. This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and ensures that `equals` function correctly identifies differences between `BlockManager` instances.
