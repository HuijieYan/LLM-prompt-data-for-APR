### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because `True is False`, which implies that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. Looking at the runtime input/output values, we see that despite the blocks having different locations, the comparison is failing to account for this difference, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.
4. The GitHub issue further highlights the problem by expecting the output to be `False`, aligning with the failing test case.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to make modifications to the comparison logic to consider block locations while performing the equality check.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check for equality between blocks considering locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding a check for the block locations in addition to the equality comparison of the blocks, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies when blocks with different locations should be considered unequal. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
