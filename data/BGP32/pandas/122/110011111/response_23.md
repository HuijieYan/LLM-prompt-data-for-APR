### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The `equals()` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their attributes like `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that the function incorrectly returns `True`.
3. The runtime values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` show that the blocks are ordered differently in the two objects (IntBlock vs. ObjectBlock).
4. The comparison method used in the function is based on a sorted order of blocks, which is causing the incorrect result.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the function compares blocks in a sorted order based on their type and locations. However, the input dataframes have blocks in different orders, leading to a false similarity evaluation.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual data values in the blocks rather than their order. We can achieve this by directly comparing block elements without relying on sorting. 

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks directly
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now compares the values of blocks directly, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks. This change should fix the bug and make the function return the correct equality result.
