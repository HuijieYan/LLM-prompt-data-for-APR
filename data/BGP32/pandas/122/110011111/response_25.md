### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects to check if their data is equal. 
- The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub also highlights this bug where it fails a simple test case.
- The runtime values and expected values of the input variables, axes, and blocks indicate that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is not working as expected.

### Error:
The bug arises from the comparison logic in the `equals` function. The comparison of blocks with different orderings due to how they are sorted based on type name and `mgr_locs` can lead to incorrect equality results.

### Fix Strategy:
- Implement a more robust comparison strategy in the `equals` function that considers the actual data of the blocks rather than just the ordering based on type names and `mgr_locs`.
- Modify the sorting in a way that ensures accurate comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function enhances the block comparison by sorting based on the actual values within the blocks. This change ensures a more accurate comparison, fixing the bug where the wrong equality result was returned.
