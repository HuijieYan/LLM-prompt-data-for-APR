### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. **Error Message**: The failing test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`, leading to the assertion failure.

3. **Issue**: The bug arises in the comparison logic of the blocks. The blocks are not correctly compared by their content but by their dtype name and mgr_locs. This causes the function to return `True` erroneously even when the content of the blocks is different.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Modify the comparison logic to compare the content of the blocks instead of dtype name and mgr_locs.
   - Update the `equals` function to iterate over blocks in the expected order and compare them content-wise.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorted blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version includes iterating over the blocks and comparing their content. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies when the blocks are not equal, resulting in the expected behavior.
