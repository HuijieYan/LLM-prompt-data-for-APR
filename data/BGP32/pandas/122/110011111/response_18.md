### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises when comparing the `blocks` attribute of the two instances. The comparison logic does not account for potential differences in block locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers both the dtype name and the location of the blocks. By sorting the blocks based on a tuple combination of dtype name and manager locations, we can achieve a consistent and correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting and comparing the blocks based on both dtype name and manager locations, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected results.
