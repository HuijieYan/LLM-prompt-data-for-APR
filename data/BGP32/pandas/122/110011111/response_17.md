### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be related to comparing DataFrame objects where the blocks have the same data but are in different locations. The bug may arise due to the comparison not being block-location aware.
2. To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to ensure that it compares the blocks in a way that considers their data as well as their order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])  # Updated to sort based on the first value in the block
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values[0])  # Updated to sort based on the first value in the block
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes modifying how the blocks are sorted before comparison. By sorting the blocks based on the first value in each block, we ensure that data with the same values but different locations are treated as equal. This change should address the bug pointed out in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.

Please execute the corrected function with the failing test to confirm the bug fix.
