### Explanation:
1. The `equals` function is comparing if two `BlockManager` instances are equal, based on their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic does not account for the case where the blocks have the same data but are in different order within the `blocks` list of each `BlockManager`. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks are swapped within the `BlockManager`.
   
2. The buggy function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. The `canonicalize` function converts the `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing. Since the `mgr_locs` are not directly comparable in the original form, converting them to a list for comparison causes the issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the `mgr_locs` appropriately without conversion to a list. This can be achieved by comparing the objects directly rather than converting them to a list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `mgr_locs` objects directly without conversion, the corrected version of the function should handle cases where the same data blocks are in different locations correctly.
