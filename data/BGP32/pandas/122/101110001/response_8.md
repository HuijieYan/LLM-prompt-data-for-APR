### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block content.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` is attempting to assert that two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True is False`, which means that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug in the function arises due to incorrect comparison logic when sorting and comparing blocks of the `BlockManager`.
5. The issue might be related to comparing blocks that should be considered equal but are not due to sorting differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly accounts for categorical and unconsolidated blocks.
2. Check the sorting mechanism for blocks and ensure that it correctly identifies blocks without altering the order that affects equality comparison.
3. Make sure that the comparison between blocks is done with appropriate criteria that truly reflect equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block keys and location metadata
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the sorting and comparing of blocks are done correctly considering block type and location metadata, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
