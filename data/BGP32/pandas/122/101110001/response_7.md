### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes match, then sorting and comparing their blocks.
2. The error occurs because the function `equals` is comparing data frames `df1` and `df2` generated in the failing test function instead of comparing `BlockManager` objects.
3. The error message `assert True is False` is triggered because the comparison between `df1.equals(df2)` (which is expected to be False) returns True, leading to the assertion failure.
4. To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare `BlockManager` objects in a way that correctly handles the internal blocks for comparison.
5. The corrected version will involve comparing the internal data blocks of the `BlockManager` objects rather than comparing the entire DataFrame objects.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = list(self.axes), list(other.axes)  # Convert axes to list for comparison
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the comparison of internal data blocks within `BlockManager` objects and ensures that the comparison is done correctly.
