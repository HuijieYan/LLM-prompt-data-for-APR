### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is an implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes, and blocks but it wrongly returns `True` whenever lengths mismatch, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different data values and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the comparison returns `True` incorrectly.
4. The bug is caused by the premature return statement in the function when the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` are not equal.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the premature return statements and consolidate the two `BlockManager` objects before comparing them to ensure a valid comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()  # Consolidating both objects before comparison
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the premature return statements and consolidating both `BlockManager` objects before comparison, we ensure a fair and accurate comparison. This should fix the bug and make the corrected function pass the failing test successfully.
