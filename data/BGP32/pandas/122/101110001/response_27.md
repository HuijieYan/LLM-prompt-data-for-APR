### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is overridden by the existing `equals` function in the same class. This leads to a conflict where the correct implementation of equality comparison is not being used when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The existing implementation of `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is flawed because it does not compare the actual data contained in the blocks but instead relies on sorting and comparing the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data but with the same column names. It asserts that the `equals` method of the first DataFrame should return `False` when compared to the second DataFrame, but due to the issue in the `equals` method, the test fails.
4. The bug can be fixed by using a different method of comparing the data within the blocks rather than relying on sorting them based on dtype and manager locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` method to compare the data within the blocks directly using Pandas' internal comparison mechanisms. This will ensure that the equality comparison is based on the actual content of the DataFrames rather than their metadata.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False

    # Compare each data block directly
    for s_block, o_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not s_block.values.equals(o_block.values):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By implementing the corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison is done based on the actual content of the blocks, ensuring that the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass successfully.
