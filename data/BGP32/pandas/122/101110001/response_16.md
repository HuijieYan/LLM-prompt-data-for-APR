### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, sorting the blocks, and then comparing the sorted blocks. The issue is likely with the sorting or comparison of blocks.

### Bug:
The bug arises because the code is comparing dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method which internally calls the `equals` function of `BlockManager` class. The comparison fails because the ordering of columns in the dataframes is different.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison mechanism in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison should be based on the values of the dataframes rather than the column order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare values of underlying data
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_data, other_data)
    )
```

By comparing the values directly, we ensure that the comparison is independent of the ordering of columns in the dataframes. This should fix the bug and make the corrected `equals` function pass the failing test.
