### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block ordering.
2. The bug lies in the implementation of the `equals` function where it fails to correctly compare the underlying data blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.
3. The failing test is trying to compare two `DataFrames` that have different values but should not be considered equal. The error message indicates that the equality assertion failed because the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects and ensure that their order and contents are consistent.
5. We need to update the canonicalization logic for comparing blocks and implement a better comparison strategy based on the contents of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Convert the block data to a tuple for comparison
        return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we convert the block data to bytes before creating the canonicalized tuple for comparison. This ensures a proper comparison between the blocks and fixes the bug that caused incorrect comparisons. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
