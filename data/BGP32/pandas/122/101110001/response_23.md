### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The comparison involves sorting the blocks within each `BlockManager` object based on a canonicalization function and then comparing each block.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, which means the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are being considered equal when they should not be.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the canonicalization function within the `equals` method where it is trying to sort the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. Since the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have columns with different types, sorting based on `dtype.name` might not produce the desired outcome for column rearrangement checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider a different approach to canonicalize blocks for comparison within the `equals` method. Instead of purely relying on the `dtype.name`, we should also consider factors like column names for a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.columns.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` method that considers column names in addition to the block locations for canonicalization, the buggy behavior should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
