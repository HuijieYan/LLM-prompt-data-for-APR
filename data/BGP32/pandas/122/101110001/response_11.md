### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file under the `pandas/core/internals` directory. This function is called to compare two `BlockManager` objects' equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` constructs two pandas DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values for the columns, then checks if `df1` equals `df2`. This test assertion is expected to fail.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True` is not equal to `False`.
4. The bug in the `equals` function is related to comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager`. It sorts the blocks by type and locations before comparing them. However, in the test case, the DataFrames are simple and should fail the equality check without considering block sorting.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to directly compare data without sorting the blocks.

### Updated `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block._data.equals(oblock._data) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
- I modified the `equals` function to compare the data stored in the blocks directly instead of sorting blocks based on type and locations before comparison. This change ensures that the test will fail as expected for simple DataFrame comparisons.
- With this change, the check `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` in the failing test will pass because the DataFrame contents are different, and the blocks are directly compared for equality.
