### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file.
- The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is validating the `equals` method by creating two dataframes with different values for the same columns.
- The error message indicates that the comparison made by `df1.equals(df2)` is returning True instead of False, which is the reason for the assertion error.
- The issue seems to be with the `equals` method not considering the content of the dataframes correctly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not produce a consistent and meaningful representation of the blocks to compare them accurately, leading to incorrect results when using the `zip` operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to create a consistent representation of the blocks for comparison.
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method is done accurately based on the sorted, canonicalized blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update canonicalize function for consistent representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.index, block.columns)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected `canonicalize` function that considers `values`, `index`, and `columns` of each block, the `equals` method should now correctly compare dataframes and pass the failing test case.
