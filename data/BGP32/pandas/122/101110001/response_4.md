### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The buggy function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by comparing their attributes. If any attribute mismatches, it returns `False`.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function is considering the order of elements in the columns while comparing two DataFrames. The failing test case is comparing two DataFrames where columns are in a different order. This comparison results in a False assertion due to the ordering difference, even though the DataFrames contain the same data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the DataFrames without considering the order of the columns.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks_names = {block.mgr_locs.index for block in self.blocks}
        other_blocks_names = {block.mgr_locs.index for block in other.blocks}
        
        return self_blocks_names == other_blocks_names
```

This corrected version compares the indices of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects to determine equality, without considering the ordering of columns.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass successfully.
