### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The purpose of this method is to check for equality between two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two different data frames and expecting them to be not equal, but the `equals` method is returning True. This is leading to an assertion error.
4. The bug is likely in the way the blocks are being compared and sorted.
5. The error message shows that the comparison is leading to True instead of False, indicating the equality check is incorrect.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `canonicalize` function where the sorting key is created using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting key is not suitable for comparing and sorting blocks, leading to incorrect results during the equality check.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to develop a more appropriate way to compare and sort the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances. We can use a custom key for sorting the blocks that involves comparing the data within the blocks itself, rather than just relying on the block attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Custom function to compare and sort blocks based on content
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1._values.equals(block2._values)  # Compare the actual data
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._values)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison and sorting of blocks will be based on the actual values within the blocks rather than on attributes like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This should resolve the bug and make the method correctly identify the inequality in the failing test.
