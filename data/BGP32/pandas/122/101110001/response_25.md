### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.
3. The bug occurs due to a mismatch in the data type values between `df1` and `df2` data frames in the failing test function. The comparison of columns in different orders leads to the incorrect result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly without considering the order of columns.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # sort blocks based on canonical values
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.items())))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.items())))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values, we ensure that the comparison is independent of the order of columns in the data frames, leading to a correct equality check. This corrected version of the `equals` method should pass the failing test.
