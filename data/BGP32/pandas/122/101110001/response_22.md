### Analysis:
1. The bug is located in the implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class in `managers.py`.
2. The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` based on their internal axes, blocks, and block attributes.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two different DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, with different data values, which should result in a `False` response.
4. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect comparison logic or handling of the internal blocks of the BlockManager instances. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` which means the comparison logic in the buggy `equals` function is resulting in an incorrect boolean value.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the comparison logic in the `equals` function, ensuring that it correctly compares the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Approach:
- We need to ensure that comparisons between the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are done properly and return the correct result based on the contents of the blocks.
- We can simplify the comparison process by comparing the underlying data of the internal blocks directly, rather than using a custom `canonicalize` function to sort them based on dtype and mgr_locs.
- Update the comparison logic to compare the internal blocks directly using either their equality methods or data equality.
- Once the comparison logic is updated, the corrected function should return `False` for the given failing test where `df1` and `df2` have different data values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the values of the blocks directly using `np.array_equal`, we ensure that the equality check is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than any metadata or internal attributes.
