1. **Analysis**:
    - The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
    - The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block content equality.
    - The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two `DataFrame` instances where the values are not equal and asserts that their equality check using `equals` should return `False`.
    - The error message indicates that the equality check is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.

2. **Bug Location**:
    - The issue lies in the logic used to compare blocks within the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.
    - Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the comparison of data blocks between the two instances, resulting in incorrect equality evaluations.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
    - The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` function.
    - When comparing blocks, the function lacks the ability to detect unequal values in corresponding blocks.
    - Due to this flaw, even when the axes are not equal in the `DataFrame` instances, the function erroneously evaluates them as equal.

4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
    - To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to compare the content of corresponding blocks within the two `BlockManager` instances.
    - This can be achieved by iterating over the sorted blocks in each `BlockManager` instance and comparing them in a pairwise manner.
    - Additionally, the function should incorporate logic to handle cases where the number of blocks is not equal in the two instances.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block.iget_block_id())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare block content pairwise
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By making the modifications as suggested above and iterating over the sorted blocks for comparison, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
