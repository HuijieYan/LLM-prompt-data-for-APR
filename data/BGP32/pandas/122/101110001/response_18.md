### Analysis:
1. The "equals" function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
2. The failing test attempts to compare two instances of `DataFrame` which internally utilize `BlockManager`.
3. The failing test gives an error indicating that `True` is being compared with `False`, and it provides information about the data in the dataframes being compared.
4. The error occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.

### Potential Error Location:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function where the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances are compared.
2. The sorting logic of the block data before comparison may lead to mismatched comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function should compare the contents of the two `BlockManager` instances, but the current implementation is not handling the comparison correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the comparison logic to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Ensure that the sorting of the blocks does not affect the comparison logic negatively.
3. Modify the comparison logic to compare the contents of the blocks effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False

        return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison logic directly iterates over the blocks to compare them, ensuring a proper comparison.
