### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is named `equals` and is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.
2. The `equals` function wrongly overwrites another `equals` function in the same class. This is incorrect and violates proper method overloading.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data to test for inequality. The error message shows that the comparison is incorrectly evaluated as `True is False`.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, which is not comparing the contents of the blocks correctly.
5. To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be refactored to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances instead of attempting to do this directly within the class itself.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def block_manager_equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

# Update the class to use the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing functions remain unchanged
    
    # Use the corrected function name and implementation
    def block_manager_equals(self, other):
        return block_manager_equals(self, other)
```

By separating the equality check logic into a standalone function and updating the class to use this corrected function, the issue should be resolved. Now the comparison will correctly compare the blocks within `BlockManager` instances, leading to a valid evaluation in the failing test.
