### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class within the `managers.py` file of Pandas.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality, checking whether their axes and blocks are equal.
3. The failing test tries to compare two dataframes with different values for columns `a` and `b`, expecting the `equals` method to return `False`.
4. The buggy function currently consolidates the axes in-place for both instances during the comparison, leading to a mismatch in comparison results.
5. The issue lies in modifying the internal state of the objects while performing the equivalence check, which can alter their state and lead to incorrect comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid modifying the internal state of the objects during the equality check to ensure consistency in the comparison results.
2. Perform the necessary operations to prepare the data for comparison without affecting the original instances.
3. Sort the blocks based on a canonicalization function for a consistent order comparison.
4. Compare the blocks after sorting without altering the original data structures.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Prepare blocks for comparison
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values.__hash__(), x.values.tolist()))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values.__hash__(), x.values.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

This corrected version ensures that the original blocks are not modified during the comparison, leading to consistent and accurate results.
