### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects represented by `self` and `other`.
2. The function checks the equality of axes, consolidates blocks in place, and then compares the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns `'a'` and `'b'` having different values. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` based on the values in the DataFrames.
4. The actual bug occurs due to the comparison of the DataFrames within the function where the equality check logic is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function. The function is comparing blocks using the `equals` method directly without considering the values present in the blocks. This compares the memory addresses of the blocks rather than their content, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the block values of the DataFrames rather than comparing the blocks directly within the `equals` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block values, not the blocks themselves
    self_blocks = self.get_blocks_values()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks_values()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, `get_blocks_values()` is a hypothetical function that would extract the actual values from the blocks of `BlockManager`. By comparing these values in the blocks, we ensure a correct equality comparison.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
