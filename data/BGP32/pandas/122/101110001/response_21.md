## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The `equals` function calls `canonicalize` to sort and compare the blocks within the `self` and `other` objects.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two different DataFrames.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, showing the comparison of the two DataFrames and the method being called.

## Bug in Function
The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrames that are not equal. The function fails to compare the DataFrames based on their values, leading to incorrect equality checks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the contents of the DataFrames element-wise to determine equality correctly. We need to modify the `equals` function to compare the DataFrames' values, not just the internal blocks.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return False

    if len(self) != len(other) or len(self.columns) != len(other.columns):
        return False

    for col_self, col_other in zip(self.columns, other.columns):
        if not col_self == col_other:
            return False

        # Compare values element-wise
        for i in range(len(self)):
            if self._data[col_self][i] != other._data[col_other][i]:
                return False

    return True
``` 

By comparing the DataFrames element-wise in the corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed. The function now checks the equality based on the DataFrame's values, ensuring a correct comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
