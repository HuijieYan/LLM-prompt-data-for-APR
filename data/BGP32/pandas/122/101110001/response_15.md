1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method checks if two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not by comparing their axes and blocks. If there is a mismatch in the axes lengths or if the blocks are not equal, the method returns `False`. However, the buggy part lies in the comparison of the blocks. The blocks are sorted and then compared which is causing the failure.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the blocks after sorting them based on a tuple of block properties.

3. The cause of the bug is that sorting the blocks based on a combination of properties like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` causes a mismatch when comparing dissimilar DataFrames. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is failing because the equality check between the two DataFrames is returning `True` instead of `False`.

4. To fix this bug, we can simplify the block comparison in the `equals` method. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks based on multiple properties, we can directly compare the blocks without any sorting operation.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of blocks based on properties and directly compares the blocks in the order they appear in the `blocks` list, ensuring that the comparison between DataFrames is done correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
