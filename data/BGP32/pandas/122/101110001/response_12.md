### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method.
2. The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking the axes and blocks for equality.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column values and checks if the `equals` method returns `False` as expected. The error message indicates that the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the inequality between the DataFrames due to the sorting operation on blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
5. To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to better represent the block characteristics that determine equality. 

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtypes), hash(block.values.tobytes()))
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to use the `dtypes` and a hash of the block values, we create a more reliable representation of the blocks for equality comparison. This correction ensures that the `equals` method functions correctly and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass without any issues.
