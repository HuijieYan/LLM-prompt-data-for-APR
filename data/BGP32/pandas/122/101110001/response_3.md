### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different column order and asserts that calling `equals` on `df1` and `df2` should return False.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with the message showing that True is returned instead of False. This error is due to incorrect equivalence checking in the `equals` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `equal` method to consider the order of columns while comparing the dataframes.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Updated comparison to consider column order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ) and self.columns.equals(other.columns)
```

By including the condition `and self.columns.equals(other.columns)` in the return statement, we now ensure that the column order is considered when comparing two dataframes in the corrected `equals` method. This modification will fix the bug causing the failing test to pass.
