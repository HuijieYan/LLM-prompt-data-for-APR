### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns of different types and values, expecting them to be unequal.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The bug might be related to how the blocks are being compared for equality, specifically with respect to handling mixed-type columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method compares the blocks' equality based on their type name and memory locations. When comparing blocks from `DataFrame` objects, the comparison doesn't handle mixed-type columns correctly, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider the blocks' data content for comparison, in addition to their type and memory locations.
2. Modify the comparison logic to account for the values in the blocks while checking for equality.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block values and modifying the comparison logic, the corrected version should handle mixed-type columns correctly and pass the failing test.
