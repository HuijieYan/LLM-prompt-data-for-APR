### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It compares the axes, blocks, and their components to determine if the objects are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values in columns `a` and `b` and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed due to the DataFrames being considered equal.
4. The bug lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function where it sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which combines `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` but doesn't handle the case where the DataFrames have different values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the values in the blocks are different while sorting and comparing them.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values in the blocks during sorting.
2. Keep comparing the blocks element-wise to determine the equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs as_array().tolist(), block.values.tolist())  # Sort based on locations and values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block values along with their locations during sorting, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle cases where the blocks have different values. This change will ensure that the `equals` method properly determines the equality between two `BlockManager` objects, fixing the bug.
