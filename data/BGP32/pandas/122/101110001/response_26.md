### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of the class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue seems to be in the block comparison logic. The comparison of blocks is based on the `equals` method of each block, which is causing the failure.
3. The failing test is trying to compare two dataframes with different data, expecting them to be unequal, but the buggy implementation does not handle this case correctly.
4. The bug can be fixed by comparing the values within the blocks of both instances rather than using the `equals` method directly on the entire block.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Instead of relying on the `equals` method of blocks, compare the values within the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
                return False

        return True
```

After making the above change, the `equals` function should compare the blocks based on their values rather than calling the `equals` method directly, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
