### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is an `equals` function that compares two instances of `BlockManager`. The function is comparing the axes, consolidating inplace, sorting blocks, and then checking if each block is equal in both instances.
2. The error seems to be originating from how the function is comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. The failing test is trying to assert that two `DataFrames` are not equal using the `equals` function, but the function incorrectly returns True when comparing the blocks.
4. The bug is caused by comparing the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which does not guarantee correct comparison between different data frames.
5. To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on the actual content of the blocks instead of sorting by dtype names and locations.


### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the blocks without sorting them based on dtype names and `mgr_locs`. This fix will ensure that the correct content of the blocks is compared between the two `BlockManager` instances.
