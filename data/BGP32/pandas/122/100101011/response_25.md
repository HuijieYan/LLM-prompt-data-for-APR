### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. If there is a mismatch in the number of axes or blocks, it returns False. It then sorts and compares the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.
- In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns but in a different order, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Error Location:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` function does not account for column order; it only considers the exact match of axes and blocks.

### Bug Cause:
- The `equals` function incorrectly assumes that the order of columns in the DataFrames should match during the comparison. This assumption leads to a False positive situation when comparing DataFrames with the same columns but in different orders.

### Fix Strategy:
- The comparison should consider the columns irrespective of their order. One possible fix is to sort the columns before comparing.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    columns_equal = all(self.name in other_axes for self.name in self.axes[0].names)
    if not columns_equal:
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

- This corrected version first checks if all columns in `self` are present in `other` before the comparison.
- This change allows for comparing DataFrames with the same columns but in different orders, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

By applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly identify the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` as not equal when tested, aligning with the expectations specified in the issue report.
