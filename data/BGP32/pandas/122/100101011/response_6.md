### Analysis:
The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be arising from the comparison of blocks in a non-canonicalized order, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of blocks in non-canonicalized order.
2. Lack of handling specific block types (e.g., `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`) properly in the comparison logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
When comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, the sorting based on `canonicalize` function is not handling the block types effectively (e.g., `IntBlock` vs. `ObjectBlock`). This leads to incorrect results where blocks with the same data content but different types might be considered unequal, causing the function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Strategies for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly differentiate between different block types.
2. Ensure that the comparison logic takes into account the block types when sorting and comparing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type (`IntBlock`, `ObjectBlock`, etc.) in the sorting mechanism. It ensures that blocks with the same content but different types are correctly compared. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function work as intended.
