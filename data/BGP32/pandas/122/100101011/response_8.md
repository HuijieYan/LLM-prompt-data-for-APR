### Analysis:
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by first checking the equality of their axes and then comparing individual blocks. However, the current implementation fails to consider the case where identical blocks might have different locations, leading to incorrect results as observed in the failing test.

### Error location:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations for comparison. This sorting may lead to false negatives when blocks with the same content but different locations are compared.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not adequately distinguish identical blocks with different locations. As a result, the equality check in the `equals` function fails incorrectly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address this bug, the `canonicalize` function should include unique identifiers for blocks, such as an index, to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not incorrectly considered unequal.

### Correction:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that includes an index to differentiate blocks with the same content but different locations:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order by type name and unique index
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = [(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(other.blocks)]

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including a unique index for each block in the sorting process, the corrected function can accurately differentiate between identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue as reported on GitHub.
