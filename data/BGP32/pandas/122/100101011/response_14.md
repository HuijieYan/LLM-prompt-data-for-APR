### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The function first compares the axes of `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
- Then, it checks if all blocks in `self` and `other` are equal by sorting them based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
- The bug occurs because the function does not adequately check for the equality of blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug is in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.
- The function should compare blocks individually based on their dtype and mgr_locs to ensure correctness.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have identical blocks but with different locations, causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return `False`.
- The function does not consider block locations when comparing, leading to false negatives in equality checks.
- Due to the sorting mechanism based on dtype name and mgr_locs, blocks with different locations are not correctly compared, resulting in a wrong equality evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Enhance the block comparison logic to consider both dtype name and mgr_locs.
2. Update the equality check in a way that accounts for identical blocks with different locations.
3. Ensure that comparing blocks is done accurately to handle cases like the one in the failing test scenario.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the block sorting mechanism in the `equals` function to correctly handle blocks' locations, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function now considers both the dtype name and mgr_locs for block comparisons, ensuring accurate equality checks for `BlockManager` objects.
