### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to how the `canonicalize` function is used to organize and compare the blocks.

### Identified Issue:
The bug arises from the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function, specifically the sorting of blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The incorrect sorting can lead to identical blocks with different locations being equated, causing the incorrect result.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals()` function to return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, violating the expected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to provide a more accurate comparison and sorting mechanism for the blocks. The comparison should consider all attributes that define a block uniquely to avoid false positives.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on block identifier
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now considers the unique identifier `id(block)` in addition to `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array`. This change ensures that blocks are properly sorted and compared, eliminating the issue of identical blocks with different locations being wrongly equated.
