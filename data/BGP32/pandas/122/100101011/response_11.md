### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManagers `self` and `other` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to occur when comparing blocks with similar content but different locations.
3. The function checks if the number of axes and blocks match between `self` and `other`.
4. It then sorts the blocks based on type name and locations before comparing them, which could lead to incorrect comparisons.
5. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with swapped columns and expects `equals` to return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused due to the sorting of blocks based on type name and locations in the `canonicalize` function.
2. This sorting does not consider the actual content of the blocks but only their type and locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. In the failing test, the content of the blocks is the same, but their locations differ, causing `equals` to incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their type name and locations.
2. Ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their locations.
3. Update the comparison algorithm to accurately identify differences in the data being compared.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if all corresponding blocks are equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        # Compare the actual content of the blocks
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By updating the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks, the corrected function should now correctly identify differences in blocks, ensuring that DataFrames with swapped columns are correctly identified as not equal.
