### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The sorting is based on the combination of the dtype name and `mgr_locs` of the block. The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames that have the same blocks but with different locations. The current implementation uses sorting based on `mgr_locs`, causing the `equals` function to return True even if the blocks are actually different.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function is using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting, which leads to incorrect comparisons when two blocks are identical in content but have different locations.
2. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same data but in different column orders, causing the faulty comparison to return True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function needs to be adjusted to correctly compare blocks even when they have different positions or locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype.name only for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to use only the `dtype.name` for sorting, the corrected version of the function should now accurately compare blocks based on data content rather than their locations or positions. This fix ensures that DataFrame comparisons considering only the content of the data within the blocks, as intended.
