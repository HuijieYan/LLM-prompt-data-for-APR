### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is meant to compare two BlockManagers, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the length of axes and if they match, it then proceeds to compare each axis individually and the blocks within those axes.
3. The bug is likely in the block comparison section where it sorts the blocks based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which fails to differentiate between blocks that are identical but located in different places.
4. The failing test compares two DataFrames with swapped column values and expects the result to be `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The `equals` function's sorting approach is flawed as it does not consider the actual data within the blocks but only the dtype name and location, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to include the actual block values, not just dtype name and mgr_locs. Sorting should be based on more meaningful information to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining block.values and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison includes the actual block values using `np.array_equal` and ensures the consistency of block locations with `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)`. This enhanced comparison should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
