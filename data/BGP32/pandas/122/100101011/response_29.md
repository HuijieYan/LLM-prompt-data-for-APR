### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes and blocks. 
2. The function seems to be incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks, leading to incorrect equality checking.
3. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames with columns in a different order, expecting `False`.
4. The bug seems to be caused by the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on type and location. This sorting could lead to incorrect comparisons.
5. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the column order in the DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the comparison logic in the `equals` function is affected by the sorting done using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting method causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the blocks directly without sorting based on type and location.
2. Ensure that the comparison handles DataFrame columns in different orders correctly.
3. Adjust the equality check to consider the values in the blocks for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub. This modification preserves the original comparison logic while fixing the bug related to block sorting.
