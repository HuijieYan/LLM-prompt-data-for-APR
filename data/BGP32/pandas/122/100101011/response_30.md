### Error Location:
The error in the `equals` function is likely caused by not considering the order of blocks when comparing the data frames. The function sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` separately based on block properties but compares them without regard to the relative block order. This leads to incorrect results when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on their properties, such as `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, without considering the order of blocks between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This can cause identical blocks in different positions to be considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks between `self` and `other` DataFrames in the same order. We can modify the `equals` function to zip the blocks in `self` and `other` based on their order of appearance and then compare them one by one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version zips the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` directly for comparison, ensuring that blocks are compared in the correct order. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave as expected in the failing test case.
