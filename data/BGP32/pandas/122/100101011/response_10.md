### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function checks if the lengths of the axes are equal and then proceeds to compare each axis using `equals` method.
3. The function then consolidates both objects in place, sorts their blocks using a `canonicalize` function, and compares each pair of blocks for equality.
4. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns swapped and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method, which should return `False`.
5. The runtime values and types for the inputs and variables inside the function need to be carefully analyzed to identify the bug in the comparison logic.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the `canonicalize` function where it should use `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This difference causes incorrect canonicalization and leads to the comparison failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect usage of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the canonicalization function, which results in a wrong comparison of block locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the described change in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison logic will work correctly, and the function should now pass the failing test properly, thereby resolving the reported issue.
