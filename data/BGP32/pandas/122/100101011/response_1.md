### Analysis:
- The buggy `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are the same.
- Then it iterates over the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, sorting them based on a canonicalization function before comparing them for equality.
- The bug in this function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` even when the input `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks based on the canonicalization may lead to erroneous results.
3. The comparison logic for the blocks after sorting.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug leads to incorrect equality comparison results due to improper handling of the block order and canonicalization. The incorrect comparison logic based on the sorting criteria causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic for axes to ensure correct dimensionality comparison.
2. Rethink the sorting criteria for the blocks to ensure that blocks are compared accurately.
3. Review the block comparison process to guarantee equivalence of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Compare the axes for equality
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison based on blocks after sorting each block based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the comparison logic for axes and refining the sorting and comparison of blocks, the corrected version of the function should now return the correct equality results, fixing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
