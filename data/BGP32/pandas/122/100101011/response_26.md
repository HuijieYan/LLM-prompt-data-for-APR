### Error Location:
The error is likely in the `canonicalize` function where `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is incorrectly used to compare block locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison method used in `canonicalize` to sort blocks based on their locations. The buggy implementation mistakenly used `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to identify block locations which resulted in generating incorrect internal block representations for comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to accurately capture unique block locations using a more robust approach.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, id(block))

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now effectively captures unique block locations using the `id(block)` method for comparison, ensuring accurate identification of blocks with different internal representations.
