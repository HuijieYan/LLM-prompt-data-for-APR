### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManagers by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames with different values in corresponding columns.
3. The issue on GitHub reports that the `equals` function wrongly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. However, this fails to handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `canonicalize` function only considers the dtype name and manager locations. Hence, for identical blocks with different locations, the comparison based solely on these attributes fails.
- This leads to the function returning True incorrectly in cases where the blocks are actually different.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison should consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their dtype and locations. We should compare the content (data) of the blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def content_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(content_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version compares the actual values in the blocks using the `content_equal` function, ensuring a proper comparison based on the block content rather than just attributes like dtype and locations.
