### Bug Explanation
The issue is caused by the `canonicalize` function not correctly comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function only uses `block.dtype.name` for comparison, not factoring in the block's `mgr_locs`. This results in identical blocks with different locations being considered equal erroneously.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to include `block.mgr_locs` in the comparison inside the `canonicalize` function. By considering both the `dtype` name and `mgr_locs` as the identifying factors for equality, we can accurately differentiate blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs as_lists())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version considers both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` in the comparison, ensuring that blocks with different locations will not be erroneously considered as equal.
