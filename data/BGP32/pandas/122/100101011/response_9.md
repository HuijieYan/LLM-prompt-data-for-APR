### Analysis:
1. The "equals" function compares two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block content.
2. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" creates two DataFrames with different values in corresponding columns and expects the "equals" function to return False.
3. The bug causes the function to return True even when the blocks have different values due to how the blocks are sorted based on dtype and mgr_locs.
4. The issue on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior of the function where it should return False for DataFrames with different block values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug lies in the sorting mechanism used in the function to compare blocks. The sorting based on block dtype and mgr_locs does not consider the actual block values, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to consider the actual block values for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting mechanism for blocks, directly comparing the blocks based on their values rather than their dtype and mgr_locs. This change ensures that the function compares the actual values within the blocks, providing the correct comparison result.
