### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes lengths, then comparing each axis and finally comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The buggy function fails to correctly handle the case where the blocks have the same content but different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to arise from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` which could lead to identical blocks with different locations being considered as equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not distinguishing between blocks with the same content but different locations. This leads to the incorrect evaluation of equality between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function considers both `dtype.name` and the actual content of the blocks while sorting. This will prevent identical blocks with different locations from being considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and content to include mgr_locs for distinguishing blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances based on both `dtype.name` and the actual content, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are not incorrectly deemed equal.
