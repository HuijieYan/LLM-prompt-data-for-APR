### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` based on their ordering in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug is specifically due to the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks. This can lead to incorrect equality results for DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in such a way that it considers the content of the blocks rather than their ordering. One approach is to loop through the blocks and compare them directly.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` without sorting based on any criteria, hence providing the correct equality assessment.
