### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. It checks if the axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks and compares them based on their data type name and location.
2. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns having different data types. The expected behavior is that it should return `False` as the dataframes are not equal.
3. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function which combines the data type name and `mgr_locs` (block locations). If two identical blocks have different locations, the comparison may fail.
4. To fix the bug, we should enhance the comparison logic to consider the data within the blocks instead of just their types and locations.

### Bug Cause:
The current bug occurs because the `equals` function relies on block locations in addition to data type for comparison. This can cause it to incorrectly return `True` even when the underlying data in equivalent blocks is different, as observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix:
We should modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual block data, removing the dependence on block locations. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified version compares the block data directly. This change ensures that even if the blocks are at different locations, as long as the data matches, the function will correctly return `False` for non-matching dataframes.

By making this adjustment, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
