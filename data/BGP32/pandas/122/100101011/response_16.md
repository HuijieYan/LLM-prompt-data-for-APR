### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances in a pandas DataFrame. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of the `blocks` attribute within the `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks before comparing them based on a canonicalization function.

#### Identified Error:
The bug arises from comparing blocks that may have identical content but different locations due to the sorting process. This leads to false negatives where the function incorrectly returns `False` for dataframes that should be considered equal.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. When blocks are identical but have different `mgr_locs`, they are treated as unequal due to the sorting operation. This issue is evident in the failing test where two dataframes with identical content but different column order are incorrectly deemed unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function to only consider the content of the blocks for comparison. We should avoid using `mgr_locs` to determine block equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Output of the Failing Test:
With the corrected `equals` function, the failing test should now pass as it correctly identifies the dataframes `df1` and `df2` as not equal due to their different column order.
