### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic based on the `canonicalize` function is incorrect as it combines the type name and manager locations without considering the actual content of the blocks. This leads to the function incorrectly identifying blocks with different values but similar locations as equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks within `BlockManager` objects, we need to modify the comparison logic. Instead of relying solely on the block type name and manager locations, the comparison should include the content of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function that incorporates the content of the blocks in the comparison:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Include block values for accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to include block values along with the type name and manager locations. By doing so, the function now properly compares the content of the blocks to determine equality. This fix should resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
