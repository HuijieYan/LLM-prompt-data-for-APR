### Error Location:
The error in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function where it returns a tuple that combines the dtype name and the locations of blocks, using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue arises from the fact that `mgr_locs.as_array` is returning different values for identical blocks with different locations, leading to a false positive comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function treats blocks as equal based on their dtype and locations, which can be different for identical blocks in different locations. This leads to a false positive comparison in the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values within the blocks instead of just their dtype and locations. By comparing block values directly, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly classified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the correction applied, the `canonicalize` function now compares block values directly by converting them to bytes. This ensures that blocks are compared based on their actual values rather than just their dtype and locations, resolving the issue of false positive comparisons for identical blocks with different locations.
