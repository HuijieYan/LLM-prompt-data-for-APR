### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `equals()` compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function is failing to correctly compare identical blocks with different locations due to the unsorted nature of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists are sorted by the `canonicalize()` function, which abstracts block information into a tuple `(dtype.name, mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. If identical blocks have different locations, they will be considered different due to this sorting strategy, leading to a false negative in the equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks directly without sorting them based on location. This can be achieved by comparing blocks by taking into account only the block content. We should sort the blocks based on the column name or index as a common identifier, ensuring that blocks with the same content are recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.items)[0])  # Sort by the first item (column name/index)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.items)[0])  # Sort by the first item (column name/index)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated Corrected Version of the `equals()` Function
In the corrected version:
- Removed the block location from the sorting key to only consider content.
- Sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the common identifier, such as the column name or index, ensuring identical blocks are recognized as equal.
- Used lambda functions to extract the common identifier for sorting.
- Remaining logic is kept intact.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly compare identical blocks with different locations.
