### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects, representing different axes and blocks within a DataFrame.
2. The function checks the lengths of axes, compares each axis, consolidates inplace, checks the block lengths, and finally canonicalizes and compares the blocks.
3. The bug is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations due to inconsistent handling of block comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers their actual content rather than their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the comparison of blocks in the `canonicalize` function, which relies too much on the locations of blocks rather than their actual contents. This results in incorrect `True` returns when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to prioritize comparing the actual content of blocks rather than just their locations.
2. Make sure that the comparison of blocks correctly handles all types of blocks, including those with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to compare block content instead of locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare actual block content, the corrected version should handle the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test case provided.
