### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking the equality between two `BlockManager` objects. The function first compares the axes of the two objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks within each object. The issue arises when the blocks are sorted based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes. This sorting can lead to different block orders even when the blocks themselves are identical.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes without taking into consideration the actual value within the blocks.
2. As a result, identical blocks with different locations can be sorted differently, leading to a false positive when determining equality.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks by their content rather than by their attributes. This ensures that the equality check considers the actual data within the blocks, rather than their location or dtype.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on values rather than attributes
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this corrected version, the `equals` function should now consider the actual values within the blocks for sorting and comparison, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
