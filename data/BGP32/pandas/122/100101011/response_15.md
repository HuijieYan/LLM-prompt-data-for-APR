### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal and then sorting and comparing their blocks.
2. The test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different data and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical data but differ in locations.
4. The cause of the bug is the sorting based on the combination of data type name and manager locations, which can lead to mismatched comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `canonicalize` sorts the blocks based on a combination of data type name and manager locations, leading to incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Only consider the dtype for sorting, not the locations
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this update, the corrected function should compare blocks based only on their data type names, disregarding their locations. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.
