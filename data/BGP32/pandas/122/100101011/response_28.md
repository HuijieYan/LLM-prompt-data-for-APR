### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is related to how the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is made. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which combines the data type name and manager locations of each block. This method can lead to incorrect results when the blocks have the same data but in different locations.

### Error Location:
The main issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that combines data type name and manager locations to determine equality. This approach fails to handle cases where blocks have identical data but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function incorrectly relies on ordering blocks based on their canonicalized representation, which is prone to failing when identical blocks have different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks directly for equality rather than sorting them based on the `canonicalize` function. By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison directly checks each block for equality without relying on sorting by the `canonicalize` function. This change ensures that blocks with the same data are correctly identified as equal, irrespective of their locations.
