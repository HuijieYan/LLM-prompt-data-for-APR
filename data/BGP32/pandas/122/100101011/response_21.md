### Identifying the Issue:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager instances based on their axes and blocks. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to fail when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` due to the reverse order of values in the columns. The GitHub issue related to this problem highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Error Location:
The issue is likely arising from the sorting process in the `equals` function, where the `canonicalize` function generates a key for sorting based on the dtype name and the manager locations of the blocks. Since the implementation does not consider the actual values of the blocks during comparison, identical blocks with different locations may incorrectly result in equality.

### Cause of the Bug:
During the sorting process within the `equals` function, the comparison logic relies solely on the dtype name and manager locations, failing to account for the actual block values. This oversight causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug and address the issue presented on GitHub, the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function should incorporate a comparison that includes the actual block values. This adjustment will ensure that the equality check considers both the data values and locations when comparing blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to include the actual block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual block values beside dtype name and manager locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function now provides a more accurate comparison of BlockManager instances, ensuring the correct equality evaluation in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.
