### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly compare the blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManagers due to inconsistent block order.
3. The failing test case provides two DataFrames with the same columns but in a different order, expecting the `equals` function to return False.
4. The issue on GitHub reports that the function wrongly returns True in this scenario, indicating a bug in the block comparison logic.

### Bug Cause:
The incorrect order of the blocks (columns) in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists causes the function to compare blocks incorrectly, leading to a False comparison and returning True.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent way that allows accurate comparison between the `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using column names
    self_blocks = {block.axes[0].name: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.axes[0].name: block for block in other.blocks}

    return all(
        self_blocks[column].equals(other_blocks[column]) 
        if column in other_blocks else False
        for column in self_blocks
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are compared based on their column names, allowing the function to accurately determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
