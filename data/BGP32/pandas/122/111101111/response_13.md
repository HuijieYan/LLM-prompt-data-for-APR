The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The bug incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have the same values but are in different locations. To fix this, we need to compare the actual block contents rather than the block objects themselves.

## Corrected version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values_equal(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use `get_values_hash()` to compare the block contents and `values_equal()` to ensure that blocks with identical values are considered equal, regardless of their locations.

This correction will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected, returning `False` for the given test case.
