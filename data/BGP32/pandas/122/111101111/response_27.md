The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class lies in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrame objects. The issue arises because the comparison of blocks is based on their order, which can lead to incorrect equality checks when blocks have identical data but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of simply comparing blocks based on their order, we should compare blocks based on their data content regardless of their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on their data content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.to_numpy().tostring())  # Sort blocks by serialized data
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.to_numpy().tostring())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now sorts blocks based on their data content before comparing them, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by providing the expected behavior for DataFrame comparison. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
