### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the sorting logic based on `canonicalize` does not correctly handle cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations. The comparison should consider the values of the blocks rather than their order or storage locations when determining equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than their sorting order. This can be achieved by comparing the block values directly rather than sorting the blocks based on a canonical ordering.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        if not block1.values.shape == block2.values.shape:
            return False
        return (block1.values == block2.values).all()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: str(b.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: str(b.values))

    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version compares the actual values of the blocks rather than their locations or order, ensuring that the equality check is based on the content itself. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
