### Bug Explanation:
The bug is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes, consolidating the blocks in both objects, and then comparing each block element-wise. The bug arises when comparing the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the comparison is incorrect.

In the failing test, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`. This happens because the function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`, which leads to the wrong comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly compare the blocks by iterating over each block and comparing them directly. Sorting based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` is incorrect and causing the bug. Therefore, the function should iterate over each block in both `BlockManager` objects and directly compare them for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing each block for equality, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly identify when two `BlockManager` objects are not equal, as in the failing test case.
