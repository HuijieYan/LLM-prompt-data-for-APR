### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The comparison fails to consider the potential scenario where blocks are identical but located differently, leading to a false negative result.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of solely checking for block equality, we should also consider the locations of the blocks to determine their equality effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks_dict = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}

    if set(self_blocks_dict.keys()) != set(other_blocks_dict.keys()):
        return False
    
    # Check equality of blocks considering their locations
    return all(
        self_blocks_dict[key].equals(other_blocks_dict[key]) for key in self_blocks_dict.keys()
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now effectively compares blocks in `self` and `other` BlockManagers based on both block equality and their locations, resolving the issue of wrongly returning true for identical blocks in different locations.
