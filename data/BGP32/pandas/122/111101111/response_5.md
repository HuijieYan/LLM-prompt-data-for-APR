### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug occurs because the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks have the same content but different locations.
2. To fix this bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks instead of their locations by adjusting the sorting mechanism before the equality check.
3. We will modify the `canonicalize` function to focus on comparing the content of the blocks rather than their locations.
4. By sorting the blocks based on their content using the modified `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison is accurate and does not depend on block locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values and type using the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison is accurate and considers the actual content of the blocks. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` now passes as expected.
