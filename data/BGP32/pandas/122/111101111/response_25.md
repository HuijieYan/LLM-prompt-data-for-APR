The issue in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class stems from the comparison of blocks based on their order in memory, rather than the actual content. 

To fix this issue, we need to sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` based on their data content, not on their memory locations. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on content before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison of two data blocks is based on the actual data they contain.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.

This modification addresses the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."
