### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking the axes, blocks, and block content. However, the bug causes it to return incorrect results when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

2. The bug lies in the comparison logic when sorting the blocks by the combination of type name and manager locations. This approach can misclassify identical blocks if their locations differ.

3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` confirms the bug by creating two dataframes with the same content but different column ordering, expecting them to be unequal, which the buggy function fails to recognize.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the block canonicalization strategy to account for identical blocks with different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block content along with the type name to accurately identify similar blocks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_pickle().encode())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated implementation, the `equals` function should now correctly identify identical blocks with different locations as unequal, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
