### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing blocks from the `self` and `other` instances. The issue lies in the sorting of the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function which combines the block's type name and locations. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing blocks with the same content but different locations.

The offending line is:
```python
self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
```

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` instances considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their type and locations. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks without sorting them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function removes the sorting of blocks and directly compares the blocks' content, ensuring a correct comparison. This fix should make the function behave as expected and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
