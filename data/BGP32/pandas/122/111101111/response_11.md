The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by the comparison of blocks using `equals` method which may return incorrect results when blocks have identical content but different locations. This issue leads to the function wrongly returning `True` in situations where it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the blocks based on content rather than their locations. We can achieve this by comparing the values within the blocks directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or self_axes != other_axes:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_values, other_block_values[idx]) 
        for idx, block_values in enumerate(self_block_values)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first check if the axes of both `BlockManager` objects are the same.
2. We consolidate both objects in place.
3. We compare the values of each block directly using `np.array_equal`.

With this updated approach, the function will correctly compare blocks' values and return the expected result.

After implementing this fix, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass as expected.
