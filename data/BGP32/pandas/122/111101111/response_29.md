### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations but with the same content. The function incorrectly returns True indicating that two `BlockManager` instances are equal even when the blocks are not in the same location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content, not their locations. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks before comparing them. This ensures that identical blocks are compared regardless of their position in the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content before comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: str(block.values.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: str(block.values.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their location. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
