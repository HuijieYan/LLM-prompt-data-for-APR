### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The issue occurs because the blocks are being sorted and compared based on their data type and memory location, leading to inaccurate results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

The bug is particularly evident in the failing test case provided, where two `DataFrame` instances, `df1` and `df2`, are expected to be not equal due to their column data type differences. However, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` because of the flawed comparison mechanism for blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function needs to be revamped. Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on data type and memory location, the comparison should focus on the actual content and structure of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

By adjusting the comparison logic to consider the data stored within the blocks rather than their properties like dtype and memory location, the `equals` function will correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison between `BlockManager` instances will accurately identify whether they are equal based on their content, effectively resolving the reported bug.
