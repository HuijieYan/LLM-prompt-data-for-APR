### Bug Explanation:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function. The function currently uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple that is compared between blocks. The problem is that the `mgr_locs` attribute may be different even for identical blocks due to the different locations, which leads to false positives in the comparison.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more consistent approach to compare the blocks. One way to achieve this is to use the block data directly in the comparison, ensuring that the block's content is compared rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Corrected Explanation:
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with a lambda function that directly compares the values of the blocks using `block.values.tolist()`. This change ensures that blocks are compared based on their content rather than their locations, addressing the issue of wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
