### Explanation:
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug occurs when comparing the equality of blocks.

The failure occurs in the `equals` function when comparing blocks. The issue lies in the sorting mechanism for blocks via the `canonicalize` function. The sorting is based on the block's dtype name and the location within the manager. If two blocks have the same dtype name but different locations, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism to include information about the block's location within the manager. By ensuring that blocks are sorted based on both dtype name and location, we can avoid the bug where blocks with the same dtype name but different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block's dtype attributes along with mgr_locs for differentiating
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.mgr_locs.block` attribute in the sorting key, we ensure that blocks with the same dtype name but different locations are properly distinguished. This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
