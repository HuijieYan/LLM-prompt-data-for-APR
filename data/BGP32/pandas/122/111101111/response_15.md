The issue in the buggy function lies in the comparison of blocks between two instances of BlockManager. The bug arises from comparing blocks based on their dtype names and mgr_locs without considering the actual content of the blocks.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The function compares blocks between self and other BlockManager instances without checking the actual values in the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.
2. The sorting of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs doesn't guarantee correct block equality comparisons.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the equality comparison to consider the content of the blocks within the BlockManager instances.
2. Implement a more robust and meaningful comparison of blocks based on their actual data values rather than just their dtype names and mgr_locs.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing the blocks directly using the `equals` method provided within the `Block` objects, we ensure that the contents of the blocks are compared for equality rather than just their types and locations.
