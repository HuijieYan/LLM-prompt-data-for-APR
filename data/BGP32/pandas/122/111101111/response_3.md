The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to consider the different locations of identical blocks when comparing them.

The issue arises from the comparison logic inside the `equals` function where blocks are sorted but not correctly accounted for in terms of location. This results in incorrect comparisons and hence the function erroneously returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly handles the comparison of blocks by considering both block type and values, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test provided.
