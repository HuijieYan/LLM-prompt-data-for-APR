The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations. This behavior causes the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue lies in the sorting mechanism used inside the `equals` function to compare the blocks of the two DataFrame objects. The function sorts the blocks of each DataFrame based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, potentially causing identical blocks with different locations to match incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism to account for the block's dtype and data values appropriately. Ideally, the comparison should ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [(i, block) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [(i, block) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)]
    
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: repr(x[1]))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: repr(x[1]))
    
    return all(index_block[1].equals(other_blocks[index_block[0]][1]) for index_block in self_blocks)
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks using the `repr` function to compare the block data values accurately, preventing blocks with different locations but the same data from being considered equal.

By applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly handle DataFrame comparisons and pass the failing test case provided.
