The bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to not detect the difference and expect `False`, but the function returns `True` instead.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The issue lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function where identical blocks with different locations are not correctly handled.
- The comparison of blocks is done based on their type name and manager locations, which can lead to false positives when comparing blocks with the same content but different order/location.

### Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly account for cases where blocks are identical but have different locations.
- One way to achieve this is to compare the content of the blocks rather than relying on their order and locations.
- We can iterate over the blocks in both `self` and `other` objects, check if they are equal by content, and then return the comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks based on their content rather than order or location, the corrected `equals` function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test case provided.
