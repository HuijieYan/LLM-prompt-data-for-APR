### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`, based on their axes and blocks.
2. At the end of the function, it iterates over sorted blocks to compare them, but the comparison does not consider the order of the blocks which may result in incorrect equality check.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks whether two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are equal. They should not be equal because the data in corresponding columns is of different types.
4. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is an incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks by considering their order in addition to their content. By creating a unique key combining the type name and the block's locations, we can ensure that equal blocks are in the same order in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects before comparison.

### Bug-fixed version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects based on a combined key of type name and locations, we ensure a consistent order for block comparison. This correction should address the incorrect equality check issue reported on the GitHub bug.
