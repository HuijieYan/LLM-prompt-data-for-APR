## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from comparing the blocks in the two instances without considering the order of the blocks within the instances. The function fails to account for the fact that identical blocks in different positions should not be considered equal. This results in incorrect return values for the `equals` function when identical blocks are shuffled.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. We should compare the blocks in a structured manner that takes into account the block types and locations to accurately determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Maintain order based on the type and location of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` function creates a unique tuple based on the block type and location. The blocks are then sorted based on this tuple to ensure that the order is consistent between `BlockManager` instances.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
