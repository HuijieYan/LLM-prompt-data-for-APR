### Explanation of the Bug
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations to compare them. If the blocks have identical data but are located in different manager locations, the function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. Instead of comparing blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, we should directly compare the contents of the blocks.

### Correction to the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Directly compare the blocks without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now compares the blocks directly without considering the manager locations, fixing the bug identified in the failing test scenario. This corrected version should now return `False` for the failing test case provided.
