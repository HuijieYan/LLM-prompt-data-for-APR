### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the `blocks` attribute of two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is currently based on the `equals` method of each block, but it should involve checking the actual content and not the order of the blocks themselves. The comparison should be based on the content of the blocks rather than their order or properties like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid relying on the `equals` method of each block for comparison.
2. Instead of comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, sort the blocks based on their content.
3. Update the comparison to check if the content of the blocks is equal rather than relying on ordered comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.values)  # Sort based on values
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.values)  # Sort based on values
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the comparison logic to sort the blocks based on their content values and then check for equality, we can fix the bug associated with the `equals` function.
