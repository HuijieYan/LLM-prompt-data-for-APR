After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances by sorting them based on block attributes like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, this leads to a problem where two blocks with the same values but different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual values within the blocks rather than their attributes. This will ensure that blocks with identical values are considered equal regardless of their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Ensure that the number of blocks is the same
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the values within each block
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version iterates over each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, checking if their values are equal using the `.values.equals()` method. This change ensures that the blocks are considered equal based on their values, rather than their attributes like `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

By updating the `equals` function with this revised logic, the function should now correctly compare `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case provided.
