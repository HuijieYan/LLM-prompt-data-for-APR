The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is that it incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have identical data but different locations. This behavior is not intended and causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the axes of `self` and `other` objects.
2. It then consolidates both objects in place using `_consolidate_inplace`.
3. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in both objects.
4. It then sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations to canonicalize the block order.
5. Finally, it iterates through the sorted blocks and compares them.

The issue arises when blocks have the same content but different locations, causing them to be treated as different and leading to an incorrect `True` return.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to handle blocks with identical content but different locations correctly. We can achieve this by altering the comparison of blocks to consider only the content, not the locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and content to handle different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.data.nbytes, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's values (content) instead of manager locations, we can ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal. This corrected version should pass the failing test and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
