### Bug Explanation
The issue arises in the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method where the equality check between two instances fails even when the blocks within the instances are identical. This is due to the way blocks are compared internally, causing the function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the equality check between the block instances considers all relevant characteristics that determine the blocks' equality. This may involve comparing the block data, dtype, and other necessary attributes for a comprehensive equality check.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Ensure all axes are equal
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure block equality by comparing relevant attributes
    def block_equal(block, oblock):
        return (
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
            and block.dtype == oblock.dtype
            and block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)

    return all(block_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By incorporating a comprehensive equality check for the blocks, the corrected function should now return the correct value based on the equality of the internal block components.

This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
