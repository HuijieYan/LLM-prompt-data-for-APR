### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class with identical blocks but different locations of those blocks. The function incorrectly returns True in this scenario, causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `equals` needs to check for identical blocks with different locations and return False in such cases. This can be achieved by comparing the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. By ensuring that the comparison considers the block data rather than just the block locations, the function can accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Why the Fix Works:
- The fixed version incorporates sorting based on the block values to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are considered equal. This modification addresses the issue highlighted in the failing test case.
- By comparing the block values directly, rather than relying on the block locations, the function can accurately determine equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
