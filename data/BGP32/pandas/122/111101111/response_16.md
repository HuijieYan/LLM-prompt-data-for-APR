### Bug Explanation:

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The bug arises from comparing the blocks inside the `BlockManager` instances based on their order rather than their content. This leads to incorrect equality checks when the blocks have the same values but are in different order or have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is based on their content rather than their order or location. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks in a way that considers the actual data they hold rather than their ordering and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    # Consolidate blocks for proper comparison
    self_blocks = [blk.consolidate() for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [blk.consolidate() for blk in other.blocks]
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version consolidates the blocks in `self` and `other` before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual data content of the blocks rather than their ordering or locations.

By using this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare `BlockManager` instances regardless of the order or location of the underlying blocks, fixing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
