### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` when it should be `False`, causing the assertion error.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing data frames `df1` and `df2` that have different values for the columns.
4. The buggy implementation does not correctly handle the case when the blocks have different values in the data frames.

### Bugs and Fixes:
1. The current implementation does not take into account the order and values of the blocks within the data frames, leading to incorrect equality checks.
2. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks of the data frames instead of the blocks themselves.
3. We can iterate over the columns of each data frame and compare the values within each column to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_df = pd.DataFrame(self.get_values())  # Get the data frame representation of self
    other_df = pd.DataFrame(other.get_values())  # Get the data frame representation of other
    
    return self_df.equals(other_df)
```

By comparing the actual data frames using `self_df.equals(other_df)` after getting the data frame representations, we ensure that the data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects is compared correctly for equality.
