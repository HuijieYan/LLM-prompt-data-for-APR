## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The error is occurring because the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames contain different data types in their columns, causing them to be considered unequal when compared by the buggy `equals` function.
3. The error message is showing that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is resolving to `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is failing to correctly identify that the two DataFrames are not equal due to their differing column data types.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to not only compare the number of blocks and axes but also compare each block content for equality, considering the data types of the columns.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Iterate through the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.
2. For each block, compare the data contained in the block to ensure they are equal.
3. If any block comparison returns `False`, the function should return `False` immediately.
4. If all block comparisons are successful, the function should return `True`.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for sblock, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not sblock.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

After using this corrected version of the `equals` function, the provided test case should pass without triggering the assertion error.
