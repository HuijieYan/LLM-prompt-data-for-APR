### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and individual blocks' equality.
2. The failing test compares equality between two `DataFrame` objects, which delegate the equality check to their inner `BlockManager` objects using the `equals()` method.
3. The main potential error locations in the `equals(self, other)` function are:
   - Incorrect handling of `as_array` method usage within the `canonicalize` function, causing the AttributeError.
   - Incorrect comparison of values within `equals` method for DataFrame columns.
4. The bug occurs due to calling the `as_array.toList()` method on `block.mgr_locs` object within the `canonicalize` function, which raises an AttributeError as it does not exist.
5. To fix the bug, we need to replace `as_array.tolist()` with `to_list()` to correctly retrieve the list representation of `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the above correction in the `canonicalize` function, the bug causing the AttributeError will be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
