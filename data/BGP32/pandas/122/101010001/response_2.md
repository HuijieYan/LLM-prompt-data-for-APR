### Analysis:
- The buggy function in the provided code snippet is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`, which suggests that the `equals` method is not returning the correct boolean value.
- The `equals` method is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using certain criteria and returning `False` if they are not equal. However, due to the bug, it seems that the method is not correctly identifying the inequality between the dataframes.
- The bug likely exists in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the blocks within the dataframes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug fix strategy involves examining the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it properly identifies and sorts the blocks from the dataframes for comparison.
- Verify that the sorting logic provides a consistent and accurate way to compare the blocks within the dataframes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block._values.tobytes()))  # Using hash of values instead of `mgr_locs`

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` method involves using a more reliable and consistent approach for canonicalizing the blocks by incorporating the hash of block values instead of relying on `mgr_locs`. This change should address the bug where the method was failing to identify the inequality between the dataframes correctly.
