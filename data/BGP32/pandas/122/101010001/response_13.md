### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class attempts to check the equality between two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
   
2. The specific error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2)` is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False`, which means that the comparison is incorrect.

3. The buggy function sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and `mgr_locs` in a tuple. The comparison is then done between these sorted blocks which results in incorrect `True` evaluations even when the DataFrame objects are not equal.

4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks before comparing them, but not based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. Instead, we should compare the content of the blocks directly.

### Suggested Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort blocks before direct comparison
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )

```

By directly comparing the content of the blocks without additional sorting based on `canonicalize`, we can ensure that the correct equality comparison is performed.
