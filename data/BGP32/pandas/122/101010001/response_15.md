### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing a test failure. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. However, based on the error message, the comparison is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`. This indicates that there is a bug in the implementation of the `equals` function.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. Since the error message suggests that it's returning `True` incorrectly, there might be an issue with the comparison logic or the handling of different data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by comparing the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames with different values in the same cells. The `equals` function is struggling to match different data types directly, resulting in a false positive in the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function to handle different data types intelligently. This modification should allow the comparison to consider the content of each cell in a DataFrame, preventing incorrect `True` evaluations when it should be `False`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function to address the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        try:
            return (block.to_numpy().tobytes(), block.index.values.tobytes())
        except AttributeError:
            return (hash(block), hash(tuple(block)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by comparing the bytes representation of the data if available, falling back to the hash of the data if conversion to bytes is not possible. This modification should ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual content of the DataFrames, allowing correct evaluation of equality.
