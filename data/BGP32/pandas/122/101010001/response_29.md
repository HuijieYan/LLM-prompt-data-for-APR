### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error message indicates that the equality comparison is not working as expected.
   
2. The potential error locations within the function are:
   - Incorrect comparison due to sorting of blocks without considering the values within the blocks.
   - Mismatch in data types of corresponding columns in DataFrames during comparison.
   
3. The bug is caused by incorrect block comparison logic in the `equals` function. It does not consider the actual values within the blocks when comparing them. This leads to incorrect outcomes in cases where the blocks are not sorted or have different data types. The error message shows that the equality comparison is failing due to these issues.
   
4. To fix the bug:
   - Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of just their types and locations.
   - Ensure that corresponding columns in the blocks have comparable data types.
   
5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, str(block.dtypes))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function compares the actual values within the blocks using `block.values` and ensures that the data types (`block.dtypes`) are compatible for comparison. This modification addresses the bug identified in the original code.
