### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and block attributes.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) that are expected to be unequal.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` method. The method improperly sorts the blocks before comparing them, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we should adjust the sorting mechanism for the blocks to ensure the correct comparison based on their content, not just their order.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to extract content from blocks for comparison
    def extract_content(block):
        return block.values

    self_block_contents = [extract_content(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_contents = [extract_content(block) for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_content, other_content)
        for self_content, other_content in zip(self_block_contents, other_block_contents)
    )
```

By adjusting the comparison logic to directly compare the content of the blocks rather than sorting them based on type and manager locations, the corrected version ensures more accurate comparison for equality. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
