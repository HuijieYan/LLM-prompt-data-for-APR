### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The error message indicates that the comparison performed by the function is incorrect, leading to a failing test case.

### Identified Issues:
1. The function is not handling the comparison of DataFrame blocks correctly, which causes the assertion error.
2. The sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs is causing inconsistencies in comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function. It fails to compare the DataFrame blocks properly, which results in the subsequent failure of the test case. The inconsistency in block sorting further exacerbates the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper comparison of DataFrame blocks by comparing each block individually.
2. Avoid sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs since they can lead to inconsistent comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block individually
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that each block within the `BlockManager` instances is compared correctly without relying on inconsistent sorting. It should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
