### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas.
2. The main error in the buggy function is that it is comparing dataframes `df1` and `df2` based on the row order and column order, leading to incorrect results.
3. The error message indicates that the test case is failing with an assertion error where one of the dataframes is being compared to the other.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the data blocks in the two dataframes before doing the element-wise comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function should sort the data blocks based on certain properties before performing the final equality check.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)  # Modified to use `values` for sorting instead of `mgr_locs`

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the fixed version of the function, the `canonicalize` function now extracts `block.values` as the sorting key instead of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This change ensures that the data blocks are sorted based on their values rather than their locations, which resolves the bug and ensures that the data frames are compared correctly.

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
