### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
2. The `equals` function defined in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances.
3. The bug is likely in the logic of comparing the blocks in each DataFrame.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the comparison logic to properly check for equality between the blocks.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self._get_block_manager_axis(), other._get_block_manager_axis()
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, (id(v) for v in block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function includes proper comparison logic for blocks and uses appropriate properties and methods to compare the blocks between two instances. This version should now pass the failing test case provided.
