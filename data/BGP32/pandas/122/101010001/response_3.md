### Analysis:
1. The provided class `BlockManager` contains a `equals` method that compares the equality of two instances of the class.
2. The buggy part of the code is when comparing DataFrame objects using the `equals` method, which results in the error message indicating that the assertion that `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.
3. The error message suggests that when comparing the two DataFrames, the comparison is not resulting in `False`, showing `True is False`, which is incorrect.
4. The issue lies in how the comparison of `df1` and `df2` is being conducted, leading to a wrong assessment of equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the current implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not handling DataFrame comparison correctly. It compares blocks within the DataFrames sequentially without considering the columns specifically, leading to incorrect equality determination.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the way the DataFrame blocks are compared by extracting and comparing the columns explicitly.
2. Consider the order of columns and values within them for determining equality.
3. Ensure that any sorting or canonicalization is done based on column names and values.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1 in self_axes:
        self_block = self.get_block(ax1)
        other_block = other.get_block(ax1)

        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
        
    return True

def get_block(self, axis):
    blocks = getattr(self, 'blocks', [])
    for block in blocks:
        if block.axis == axis:  # Assuming blocks have axis information
            return block
    return None
```

In the corrected version:
- The `equals` method now compares blocks of DataFrames based on their axes (column names) explicitly.
- The `get_block` method is added to fetch the block associated with a given axis (column).
- The comparison is now done for each axis individually, ensuring a more accurate assessment of DataFrame equality.

This corrected version should pass the failing test for DataFrame equality comparison.
