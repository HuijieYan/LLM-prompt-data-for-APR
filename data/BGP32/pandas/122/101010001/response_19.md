### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an assertion failure in comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, which should return `False` for the provided test case.
2. The buggy function attempts to compare two `BlockManager` instances containing DataFrames for equality.
3. The key issue causing the failure is the incorrect comparison logic. The function fails to properly cross-check the elements and order within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison considers the elements and order within each block as part of the comparison process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to sort the blocks inside each `BlockManager` instance based on a canonical representation that includes both the data type name and the location of each block. This strategy helps ensure that blocks are properly aligned before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances while considering both the data type name and block locations as part of the comparison process.
