The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is due to comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but the assertion is failing when it should pass. The failing test message indicates that the expected result is False, but the actual result is True. This occurs because the buggy logic is assuming the block order to be consistent between the two DataFrames, but it doesn't account for the different values of those blocks.

To fix this bug:
1. Instead of relying on the order of blocks to perform the equality check, each block's content should be compared directly.
2. Each block inside `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be compared one-on-one.

Here is the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly instead of relying on block order
    for block_key in self.blocks.keys():
        if block_key not in other.blocks:
            return False
        if not self.blocks[block_key].equals(other.blocks[block_key]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly by iterating over the keys of `self.blocks`, ensuring that the content of each block is checked for equality with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This method fixes the bug and should pass the failing test.
