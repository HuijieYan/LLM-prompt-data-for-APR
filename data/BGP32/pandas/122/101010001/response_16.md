### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an assertion error where `assert True is False` which suggests that the expected result of `df1.equals(df2)` is `False` but the function is returning `True`.
2. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes (`self` and `other`) by comparing their axes first and then sorting and comparing their blocks. The issue seems to be with the comparison logic of blocks.
3. The bug is likely due to the comparison of blocks not working correctly. When comparing blocks, the function should consider the values within the blocks and not just their order.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks instead of just comparing them based on their order.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function considers the actual values within the blocks.
2. Sort the block values before comparison if necessary to have a consistent comparison logic.
3. Update the block comparison part of the code to properly check the equality of blocks.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Actual correction in block comparison
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function compares the values within the blocks using `block.values.equals(oblock.values)` to ensure that the data within the blocks is compared correctly.

This correction should address the bug and make the function work as expected.
