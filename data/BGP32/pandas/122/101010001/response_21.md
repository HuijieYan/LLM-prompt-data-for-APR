### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` compares two `BlockManager` objects using the `self.blocks` attribute. The error message indicates that the comparison between DataFrames `df1` and `df2` fails when calling the `equals` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing DataFrames of different structures.
2. Sorting issue with `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. Flaw in the canonicalization logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the attempt to compare two DataFrames with different data structures. In the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the columns have different data types, resulting in the comparison failure in the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with different data types in the DataFrames. We can make a comparison based on the values in the DataFrames rather than the data types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the shapes of the DataFrames
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
        
    # Check if the columns match in order and content
    if not all(self.columns.equals(other.columns)):
        return False
    
    # Check if the values in the DataFrames match
    if self.values.tolist() != other.values.tolist():
        return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the shapes of the DataFrames match. Then we compare the column names to validate their correspondence. Finally, we compare the values in the DataFrames to determine if they are equal. This approach ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the DataFrames rather than their structure or data types.
