### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison of two `DataFrame` objects using the `equals` method is not returning the expected result.

### Identified Issue:
1. The root cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly converting `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a list. This list conversion is causing the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to fail.
2. In the failing test case, the comparison of two `DataFrame` objects is failing because of the issue described above.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, convert the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple within the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the order preservation required for comparison is maintained. This will allow the correct comparison of axes and blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects, resolving the bug allowing the failing test case to pass.
