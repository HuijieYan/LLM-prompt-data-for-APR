### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing when comparing two DataFrames.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrames with different data values in the `df1` and `df2`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare the data values in each block of the two DataFrames within the `equals` function. The current implementation sorts blocks by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which causes the incorrect comparison of DataFrame content.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual values of the blocks for comparison.
2. Update the logic in the `equals` function to compare the block values in addition to sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
3. Ensure that all corresponding blocks are compared between the two DataFrames for equality.


### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Canonicalize block order, including actual block values for comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrected version above, the bug within the `equals` function should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
