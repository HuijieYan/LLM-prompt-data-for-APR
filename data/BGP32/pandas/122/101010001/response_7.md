### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check whether two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates a failing test where `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`, leading to the assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic that does not handle cases where the data types of columns are not matching. Sorting based on `canonicalize` function may not correctly differentiate blocks in these cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to properly handle differences in data types while comparing blocks.

### Suggestions for Fix:
One possible strategy to fix this bug is to enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider the data types of the blocks apart from their `dtype.name` to ensure a more robust distinction between blocks. We can incorporate a unique identifier for each block based on both the data type and actual data values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, ExtensionBlock):
            return (block.extension_array.__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.extension_array)
        else:
            return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function enhances the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data values when comparing blocks. By incorporating more details from the blocks, this function now properly handles cases where data types or specific values might differ.
