### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `equals`, in the `BlockManager` class is checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, blocks, and block data.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion fails when comparing two `DataFrame` instances (which are subclasses of `BlockManager`) using the `equals` method. The expected output should be `False` since the two `DataFrame` instances have different column order and data.
3. The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to directly comparing the blocks without considering the order of columns in the `DataFrame`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into consideration the column order in each `DataFrame`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to sort the columns based on their order in the `DataFrame` before comparing the blocks.
2. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the columns' order.
3. After sorting the blocks based on the columns, we can then compare the blocks for equality while considering the column order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort the blocks based on the column order before comparing
        return tuple(block.columns)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now consider the column order in the `DataFrame` instances when comparing the blocks, resolving the bug that caused the failing test.
