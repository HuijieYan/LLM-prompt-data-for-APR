### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is failing the test due to incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects.
2. The error is related to comparing the actual values of columns within DataFrames, which leads to false positives.
3. The error message indicates that the test assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is producing the wrong results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to properly handle the comparison of DataFrame blocks.

### Strategy:
1. Instead of performing a direct comparison between blocks using the `equals` method, we should compare the values of the blocks directly.
2. We can iterate over the blocks and check if the values are the same to determine equality.
3. Sorting and canonicalizing blocks based on dtype and manager locations can help in comparing blocks correctly.
4. Implementing a loop to compare corresponding blocks from both DataFrames should fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and isinstance(block, oblock.__class__)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures correct comparison of DataFrame blocks by directly comparing the values of the blocks and matching their data types.
