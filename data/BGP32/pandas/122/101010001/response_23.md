### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality by checking their internal structures.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison done inside the function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the provided test case.
3. The issue seems to be with how the comparison is being executed on the underlying blocks of the instances.
4. The `equals` method is not comparing the data within the DataFrames correctly, leading to the wrong result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, we need to compare the underlying data within each block to determine if the instances are equal.
2. We should iterate over the blocks and check their equality based on the content rather than just comparing the blocks as objects.
3. We can create a helper function to compare the data inside each block and use it in the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def compare_data(block1, block2):
        # Compare the block data based on dtype and values
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        compare_data(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `compare_data` helper function to compare the data within each block while iterating over them in the corrected `equals` function, we ensure that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks rather than just the blocks themselves. This corrected approach should address the bug and make the `equals` function work as intended.
