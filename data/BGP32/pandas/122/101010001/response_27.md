### Analysis:
1. The function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The error message points to the problem in the comparison of two `DataFrame` objects using the `.equals()` function.
3. The bug in the function is likely due to the incorrect comparison being made between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.
4. The issue seems to be with the way the `DataFrame` blocks are being sorted and compared, leading to the incorrect assertion failure.

### Suggestions to Fix the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `BlockManager.equals()` function correctly compares the blocks of the two objects.
2. Check the sorting mechanism for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to make sure they are ordered in a way that allows for accurate comparison.
3. Pay attention to the `canonicalize()` function to guarantee it is producing correct values for sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block_type, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the `canonicalize()` function to include `_block_type` and properly converting `mgr_locs` to bytes, the function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` objects. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
