### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The function first checks the lengths of the axes and blocks to ensure they match between the two instances. Then, it consolidates and sorts the blocks based on type and locations for comparison. The bug occurs in the comparison logic within the `all` function, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly handles cases where blocks may have different locations but contain the same data.
5. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` when comparing `df1.equals(df2)` for the provided test case.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug and ensure correct comparisons despite different block locations, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function. We can modify the comparison process to compare blocks based on content rather than their actual locations. By making this change, the function will correctly identify the provided test in the GitHub issue as unequal.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._rebuild()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the comparison logic to focus on block content through the `_rebuild()` method, the corrected function will return the expected `False` value for the provided test case.
