### Analysis:
1. **Bug Location**: The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library is being tested by the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py`.
   
2. **Bug Description**: The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This behavior is not as expected and leads to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two DataFrames with swapped columns are expected to be not equal.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug arises from the comparison logic in the `equals` function where it sorts the blocks but does not consider the locations properly.
   - The sorting is done based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, leading to incorrect equality checks.
   - When comparing two DataFrames with the same blocks but different locations, the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` due to the flawed comparison logic.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To resolve the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider block locations when determining equality.
   - A new comparison method should be implemented that takes into account the actual data values and locations of the blocks in addition to the dtype name.

### Bug-fixed code:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` after applying the fix to the `equals` function should result in a successful assertion.
