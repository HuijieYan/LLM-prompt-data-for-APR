The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The function is expected to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. However, it is not handling the comparison correctly which results in unexpected `True` output when two different `DataFrames` should return `False`.

The main issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. By using a helper function `canonicalize(block)` to sort the blocks based on their type and locations, the function can ensure a proper comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on the axes and blocks, returning `False` when the blocks are not equal even if they have different locations.

The corrected function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case while producing the correct output.
