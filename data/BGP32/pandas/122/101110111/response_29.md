### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises if the blocks are in the correct order but have different locations.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different orders, expecting `False` as the output of `df1.equals(df2)`.

3. The failing test triggers an `AssertionError` because the buggy `equals` function returns `True` in such cases.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function sorts the blocks based on a tuple consisting of the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting aims to distinguish unconsolidated blocks that may appear the same when comparing elements directly.

2. The issue occurs when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical, leading to incorrect comparison results.

3. The failing test demonstrates this bug by creating dataframes with columns in different orders, which should not be considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle cases where block locations differ but content remains the same.

2. Instead of using the current sorting method, we should enhance the comparison to account for block content regardless of location.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected version of the buggy `equals` function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue by comparing blocks directly without relying on different block locations. Now, the comparison ensures that dataframes with equal content but different column orders are correctly identified as unequal.
