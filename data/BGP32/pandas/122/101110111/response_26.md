## Analysis
The buggy function `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas core is causing the failing test. The function compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on a series of conditions. However, the comparison logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the function returning `True` incorrectly for unequal DataFrames.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison logic inside the `equals()` function.
2. Sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize()` function.
3. Handling of the BlockManager objects for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic within the `equals()` function. When comparing columns of different types between DataFrames, the buggy logic fails to detect the mismatch due to not considering data types properly. This results in the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals()` function, we need to revise the comparison logic to account for different data types and ensure that the function correctly identifies unequal DataFrames. We must also ensure that the block sorting method and BlockManager handling are appropriate for the comparison.

### Updated `equals()` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version of the function ensures proper comparison by accounting for data types and addresses the mishandling of block sorting and BlockManager objects.

By updating the `equals()` function as provided above, the bug causing the failing test should be resolved, and the function should now correctly identify unequal DataFrames.
