### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different locations but the same content.
2. The error message indicates the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two dataframes with different column orders are expected to return `False` when comparing using the `equals` function.
3. The bug is caused by sorting and comparing blocks based on their type name and manager locations, resulting in a false positive comparison. The expected behavior should consider the block content primarily.
4. To fix this bug, the comparison should prioritize comparing the block content rather than sorting based on the type name and manager locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple of block values only for comparison.
2. Update the sorting logic to use the revised `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their values.
3. Adjust the return condition to ensure the comparison considers block content for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with this corrected version of the function, the comparison will properly prioritize the block content, leading to the expected behavior in the failing test case provided.
