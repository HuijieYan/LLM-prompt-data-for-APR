The bug in the `equals` function arises due to incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks with different locations. The buggy function erroneously returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block's position (`mgr_locs`). This adjustment ensures that blocks with the same content but in different positions are considered as different blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and the block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should now appropriately handle identical blocks with different locations and return the expected output.

After applying this fix, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case should pass without any assertion errors.
