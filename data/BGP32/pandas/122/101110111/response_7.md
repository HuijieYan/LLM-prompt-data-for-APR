### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values that should not be equal, which asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`.
- The failing test indicates that the buggy function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing the DataFrames that are expected to be different.

### Error Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not correctly handle the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts and compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which does not guarantee equality.
- The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic between blocks is incorrect, leading to the function returning `True` when comparing different blocks with the same `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks in a way that ensures the actual content equality rather than based on type and location.
- One approach to fixing the bug is to iterate over the blocks and compare their content directly rather than sorting and comparing based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the content of each block, this corrected version of the function should now return `False` for the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, as expected.
