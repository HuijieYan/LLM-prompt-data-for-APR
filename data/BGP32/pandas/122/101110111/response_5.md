Considering the information provided, the issue stems from the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and item ordering. However, the buggy implementation fails to deliver the expected result due to a flawed comparison mechanism.

### Bug Cause Analysis:
1. The buggy function compares `self_axes` and `other_axes` for length equality but does not compare their actual contents.
2. The function then proceeds to sort and compare `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without ensuring that they are correctly aligned, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that both axes lists (`self_axes` and `other_axes`) have the same contents before proceeding with comparison.
2. Align the block lists (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) based on a consistent criterion to enable accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring the consistency of axes and aligning the blocks correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
