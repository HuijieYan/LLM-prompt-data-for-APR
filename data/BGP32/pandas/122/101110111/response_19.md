### Bug Explanation

In the buggy function `equals`, the issue arises from the fact that the block order is being canonicalized based on the combination of block type name and `mgr_locs` values. This approach is incorrect because blocks can have equivalent data but different locations due to being unconsolidated. As a result, the `canonicalize` function incorrectly identifies blocks as distinct when they should be considered equal. This leads to the `equals` function returning `True` incorrectly for cases where blocks are actually different but equivalent due to unconsolidated states.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To address the bug, we should modify the way block equality is determined in the `equals` function. Instead of using the canonicalization approach based on type name and locations, we should directly compare the data in each block to determine equality. This change will ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies equivalent blocks even with different locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the equality comparison of blocks is done directly based on the block data itself, rather than relying on potentially misleading block canonicalization.
