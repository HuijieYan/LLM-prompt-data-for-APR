## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` library is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The issue arises when comparing blocks that have identical data but different locations due to inconsistencies in internal sorting.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two `DataFrame` instances with different data types within columns and expects `equals()` to return `False`.
4. The failing assertion error message indicates that the comparison erroneously evaluates to `True`.
5. The bug is identified as related to the internal sorting of blocks during comparison, causing the function to incorrectly determine equality.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To correct the bug, we need to assure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison to ensure accurate equality checks.
2. We can apply a sorting function based on block data types and locations prior to the equality comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a sorting function based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtypes), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `canonicalize` sorting function, the corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and should pass the failing test case.
