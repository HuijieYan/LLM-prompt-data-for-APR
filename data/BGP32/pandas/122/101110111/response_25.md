### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is supposed to check if two BlockManager instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to stem from the sorting of blocks before comparison.
2. The failing test aims to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different column values, expecting them to be unequal.
3. The bug causes the buggy `equals()` function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, leading to test failure.
4. To fix the bug, the sorting logic in the `equals()` function should be revised to ensure a correct comparison between block data.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction addresses the incorrect outcome by adjusting the block comparison method in the `equals()` function for proper DataFrame equality checks.

By implementing this correction, the issue reported on GitHub related to DataFrame equality check failures with identical blocks and different locations will be resolved.
