After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the bug lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when checking if one `BlockManager` object is equal to another. 

The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` instances that have the same blocks but in different locations. This is because the function does not properly compare the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks.

To correct this bug, the `canonicalize` function should accurately represent the block by combining the type name and the locations. Then, sorting blocks based on this canonical representation should ensure that different block locations are taken into account during comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The correction involves converting `block.mgr_locs` to a tuple to represent the block's locations uniquely. Sorting the blocks based on this canonicalization should ensure that the comparison includes block locations.

By implementing this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances, taking into account the block locations, and pass the failing test case provided.
