### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class where it is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The bug stems from the comparison of blocks without considering their actual content but solely relying on their order. This leads to wrong results when the blocks have the same content but are in different order due to the sorting process.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to check if the content of the blocks matches rather than just their order. This can be achieved by comparing the individual blocks using the `equals` method of each block.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method directly compares the content of each block pair rather than relying on their order. This should resolve the issue and ensure correct comparison results.
