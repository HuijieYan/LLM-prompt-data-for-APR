### Fixing the Bug

#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library fails to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. The issue is highlighted by a failing test where two dataframes are intentionally structured differently but are erroneously identified as equal.
2. The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, but the comparison logic is flawed due to uncanonicalized block order.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values for 'a' and 'b' columns, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`.
4. The error message indicates that the comparison results in `assert True is False`, indicating that the two dataframes are mistakenly identified as equal.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The bug can be fixed by updating the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks from the two `BlockManager` instances. Specifically, the blocks should be sorted based on their type name and locations to ensure consistent comparisons.
2. As the failing test provides a clear indication of the bug, it will be crucial to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to address the issue mentioned in the failing test scenario.
3. The sorting of blocks should be done in a canonicalized manner to ensure consistent comparison results between different `BlockManager` instances that may have the same blocks but in different orders.

#### Corrected Version of the `BlockManager` class with the fixed `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the `equals` function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Existing functions in the BlockManager class

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks in a canonicalized manner using the block's type name and locations, the correction ensures consistent comparison results across different `BlockManager` instances. This fix addresses the issue reported in the failing test scenario, where two dataframes with different column values were wrongly identified as equal.
