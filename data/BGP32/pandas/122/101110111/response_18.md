After analyzing the buggy function `equals` and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, we can identify the source of the bug and provide a fix.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality, but it has a logic issue causing it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.
  
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between the two `DataFrame` objects shows they are equal, which is incorrect based on the test assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Rather than comparing the blocks directly, we can iterate over the sorted blocks based on a canonical key that combines the block type name and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure identical content blocks are compared correctly regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected function correctly compares the blocks while ignoring their specific locations.

This fix should address the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue and validate the expected behavior outlined in the failing test.
