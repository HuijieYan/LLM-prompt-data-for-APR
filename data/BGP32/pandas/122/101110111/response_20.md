### Corrections and Explanations

#### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in pandas is not comparing the data blocks correctly, leading to incorrect equality checks.
- The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two DataFrames are equal, but the buggy `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly.
- The expected input/output values indicate the correct comparison that should happen between the axes and blocks of two BlockManager instances.

#### Bugs:
1. The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the block data and their positions, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider both block data values and their positions.
2. Use the updated `canonicalize` function to properly sort the data blocks before comparing them in the `equals` function.
3. Ensure that the function handles both the block values and their locations to determine equality.

#### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to consider block values and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # sort blocks based on canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying these corrections, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the data blocks and their positions, leading to correct equality checks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
