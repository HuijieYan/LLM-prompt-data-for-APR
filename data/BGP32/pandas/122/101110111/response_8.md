### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The comparison involves checking if the axes are equal and then sorting and comparing the blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and expects the `equals` method to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should be `False`.
4. The expected values and types provided give insights into the correct values at each step of the comparison process.
5. The GitHub issue indicates a similar problem where the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with different block locations.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function causes the comparison to return `True` for two `BlockManager` instances with the same contents but different block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The issue seems to be related to how blocks are compared, especially when the blocks have different locations.
2. Address the comparison logic and ensure that it correctly compares blocks even if they have different locations.
3. Consider modifying the canonicalization of blocks to handle different block locations properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, values, and **locations** to handle different block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating information about the block locations in the canonicalization process, the corrected function should now properly handle cases where DataFrames have identical blocks but different block locations.
