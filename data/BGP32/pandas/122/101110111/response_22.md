The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without proper ordering based on the block type and locations. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation between two `BlockManager` instances as shown in the failing test case and GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on the block type and locations before comparison. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the block type and locations. This ensures that the blocks are in the same order before comparing them during the equality check.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` and correctly evaluate the equality between two `BlockManager` instances as expected.
