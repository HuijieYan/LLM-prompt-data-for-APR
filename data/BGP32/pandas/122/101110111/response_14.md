### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check the equality of two instances based on their axes and blocks. 
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data, and the test expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement failed because `True is False`, suggesting that the `equals` function incorrectly returned `True`.
4. The bug seems to stem from the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function, possibly due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs.
5. The expected values and types of variables provided for different cases give insight into the correct behavior expected from the corrected function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the incorrect comparison logic in the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function. This sorting may not account for the actual equality comparison logic needed for the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider comparing the actual internal data of the blocks instead of dtype and locations.
2. Ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function directly checks for equality of the blocks' data.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected BlockManager class with the fixed equals function

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Existing functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            # Adjust the canonicalize function to compare the internal data within the blocks
            return block.values.tostring()
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare the internal data within the blocks and adjusting the comparison in the `equals` function to use `block.values.equals`, we can ensure that the equality check is based on the actual data rather than just the block characteristics.
