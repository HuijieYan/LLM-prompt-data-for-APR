### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block orders.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` with columns swapped and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return False.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returned True instead of False.
4. The expected input/output values indicate the expected contents and types of variables at various points during the function execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function fails to properly handle the comparison of block locations. Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations is flawed as similar blocks can have different locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying solely on sorting based on block properties, we should add a check to verify that the block contents are equal even if the locations differ. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks directly without considering their order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks without sorting based on dtype and location. This should ensure that the function returns the correct result for the failing test case and any similar scenarios.
