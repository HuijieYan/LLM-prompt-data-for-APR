## Fixing the Bug

### Potential Error Location
The bug seems to be occurring in the comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is faulty, leading to incorrect results during DataFrame comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect sorting, leading to discrepancies in the comparison of data blocks from two DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block type for ordering.
2. Avoid sorting using `mgr_locs` as it seems to be causing the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # ignore function body

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # ignore function body

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.dtype.name

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

#### The corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their types, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub post and passing the failing test case.
