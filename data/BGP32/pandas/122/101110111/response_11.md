### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns swapped and expects the `equals` function to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The expected input values and types are provided for the `BlockManager` objects and related variables.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the faulty comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function might not account for different block locations, leading to incorrect equality check.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the tuple for sorting. This way, blocks with identical contents but different locations will be handled correctly during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (canonicalize(x), x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (canonicalize(x), x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.
