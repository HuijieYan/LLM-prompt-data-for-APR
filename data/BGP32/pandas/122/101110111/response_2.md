### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes have the same length, if each pair of axes are equal, if the number of blocks in each object are equal, and if each corresponding block in the two objects are equal. 
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values to check if the `equals` method correctly identifies them as not equal.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when it fails to correctly compare two dataframes. The issue arises from incorrect comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames due to wrong identification of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to the function wrongly returning `True` when the DataFrames are not actually equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly compares the blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects. We can utilize a `sorting` mechanism to canonicalize the block orders before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By utilizing the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on type name and location, we ensure a consistent comparison between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, resolving the issue with identifying identical blocks with different locations.
