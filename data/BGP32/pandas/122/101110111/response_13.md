### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations, and then checking if each block is equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different data types and values but the same column names and checks if they are equal using the `equals()` method. This test fails because the method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion of `True is False` failed, meaning that the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be `False`. This is due to the check within the function failing to properly compare the different data types of the blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks takes into account both the dtype name and the manager locations when determining the order. This way, blocks with different data types but the same name will be considered distinct.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize()` function to include a tuple of the dtype name and the manager locations converted to a tuple, we ensure that blocks with different data types are treated separately. This modification allows the `equals()` method to correctly compare `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test.
