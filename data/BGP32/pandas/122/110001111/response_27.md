### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and if their individual blocks are equal after sorting them.
2. The buggy condition arises due to the blocks being compared in a sorted manner disregarding the actual order.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on their original order rather than sorting them by type and location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

This fixed version compares the blocks directly without sorting them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly evaluated as equal.
