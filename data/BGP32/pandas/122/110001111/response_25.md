### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the blocks based on dtype and locations but fails to consider equal blocks with different locations as equal.
3. The bug is reported in a GitHub issue where the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations, causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider blocks with the same content but different locations as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function or introduce a new method to compare blocks based on their content rather than just dtype and locations.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks considers equality even if the blocks are located differently within the `BlockManager`.
3. Update the return condition to reflect the corrected block comparison logic.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the `compare_blocks` function to compare the actual content of blocks, the corrected function now properly handles cases where identical blocks exist with different locations, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
