### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances. It checks if the lengths of the `axes` are the same, then iterates over both sets of `blocks` and their corresponding `mgr_locs` to check for equality.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly handle the comparison of blocks due to an issue with the sorting and comparison logic.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical, leading to incorrect equality checks in certain scenarios.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function's logic for sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal during the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the type name and the locations of the blocks for sorting. This change will prevent identical blocks with different locations from being treated as equal.
2. Modify the sorting logic in the `sorted` function call for both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to use the updated `canonicalize` function.
3. Ensure that the `equals` function returns `False` if any of the blocks have different locations, even if their content is the same.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are no longer considered equal, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
