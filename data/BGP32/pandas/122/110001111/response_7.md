**Analysis:**

1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManager objects for equality, first by checking their axes, then their blocks after consolidating them in place.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, especially in their ordering during the `canonicalize` step before comparison.
3. The mentioned GitHub issue points out that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning True even when the blocks have identical content but different locations.
4. The root cause may lie in how the blocks are sorted and compared, potentially leading to different ordering due to block consolidation.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. To correct the bug, ensure that the blocks are adequately sorted and compared in a consistent manner, accounting for consolidated blocks with different but equivalent locations.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block content for equality comparison instead of solely relying on the dtype and mgr_locs.
3. Update the comparison logic to handle different block locations while ensuring the content equality is accurately checked.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks after sorting and canonicalizing them
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version focuses on ensuring that the equality comparison in `equals` function correctly handles the blocks' content despite potentially different locations. It sorts and compares blocks based on their contents to provide an accurate equality check.
