### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different orders, which causes identical blocks with different locations to be mistakenly evaluated as equal. When sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not considered, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute when sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function includes sorting the blocks by both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes to ensure that blocks are correctly identified for equality comparison. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as equal.
