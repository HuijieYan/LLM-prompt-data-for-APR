### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality.
2. The buggy function has a logic error in the block comparison part.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False` for different blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the block comparison logic to correctly handle cases where blocks have different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic that compares blocks to also consider block locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on both the block data type name and the block manager locations.
3. Compare blocks based on the sorted order to ensure correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now the `equals` function will correctly compare the blocks based on their data type name and locations, ensuring the expected equality checks.
