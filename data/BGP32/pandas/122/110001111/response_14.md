### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue seems to arise when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method currently compares the blocks based on their order, disregarding the content. This leads to a false positive comparison when blocks have the same content but different locational information.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method. Instead of comparing blocks based on their order, we should check if the content of the blocks is equal regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block._get_block_unique_ids()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block._get_block_unique_ids()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now sorts the blocks based on their content rather than their order, ensuring that the comparison takes into account the actual data stored in the blocks. This modification should address the bug reported on GitHub.
