### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is used to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description is related to the function returning `True` instead of `False` in a specific case.
3. The bug seems to stem from how block sorting is done based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. If two identical blocks are located differently, they are incorrectly considered equal.
   
### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly assumes that blocks with different locations are equivalent if their content is the same.
2. Sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` can lead to identical blocks being considered different.
   
### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, compare directly based on block equality.
2. Avoid sorting blocks to preserve their original order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality instead of relying on sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, the corrected version ensures the correct comparison between `BlockManager` objects.
