### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if their axes are equal and if all their blocks are equal.
2. The issue arises when the blocks have the same content but different locations, resulting in a misleading True output even though the blocks are not actually equal.
3. The function compares blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, but does not account for the case where the blocks have the same content but different locations.
4. To fix this, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their sorting order.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Prioritize comparing the content of the blocks over their ordering based on dtype name and manager locations.
2. Update the logic inside the `equals` function to check for block equality based on their actual content.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check block equality based on their content
    def block_content_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block_content_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the equality comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, addressing the issue of misleading True output when the blocks have the same content but different locations.
