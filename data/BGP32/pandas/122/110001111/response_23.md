### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.
3. The bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

### Error Location:
The issue appears to be in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort and combine the blocks based on their types and locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not account for the actual data in the blocks, but only their type names and locations. This results in blocks with identical data but different locations being incorrectly marked as unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the block's data along with its type and location. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data in the comparison to ensure that blocks with identical content are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's values in the comparison, we ensure that blocks with the same content are correctly identified as equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
