### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking the axes and blocks. The bug seems to arise when comparing blocks that are identical but have different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations, which can lead to incorrect results if the block locations are different even though the blocks themselves are equal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not handle block locations properly, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison to properly distinguish between blocks with the same type name but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version incorporates the block locations in the comparison through using `tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array)` in the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
