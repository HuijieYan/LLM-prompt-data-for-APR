### Bug Analysis:
- The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
- The function checks if the length of `self.blocks` is equal to the length of `other.blocks`, but it might return true even if the blocks are different.
- The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function returns True incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The ordering of blocks is not being considered when comparing them.
- The function compares the blocks based on their content but doesn't consider their locations, leading to incorrect results as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are compared based on their content and their locations to correctly determine equality.
- Sorting the blocks based on both content and locations before comparing them should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks is equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, considering dtype name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The corrected version sorts the blocks based on both the dtype name and locations before comparing them, ensuring the correct comparison for equality.
- By considering both content and locations, the function can correctly identify when two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.
