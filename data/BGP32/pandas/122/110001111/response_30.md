### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks and compares them. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` when the blocks have identical data but different locations.
2. The bug seems to stem from how the function sorts and compares the blocks without properly considering different locations of identical blocks.
3. In the provided Case 1, the bug likely arises when comparing the blocks without considering the locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for block locations effectively. We should compare blocks based on their data, regardless of their location within the `BlockManager`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block data because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adjusts the `canonicalize()` function to compare blocks based on their data values rather than just their type names. This change should address the bug reported on GitHub by properly considering block data and locations for equality evaluation.
