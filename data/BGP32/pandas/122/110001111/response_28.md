### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The issue occurs when the blocks are sorted using a custom sorting key that combines the dtype name of the block and the `mgr_locs` attribute. Since the `mgr_locs` attribute for two identical blocks can have different addresses in memory, the comparison fails even though the blocks are equivalent.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to consider a different approach for comparing the blocks. One way to resolve this issue is to compare the blocks directly without relying on their memory locations. We can modify the sorting key to only use the dtype name of the block for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name for comparison, we address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report. This change allows the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers based on their dtype, ensuring that function returns the correct result.
