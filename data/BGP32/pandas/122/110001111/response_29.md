### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes and blocks for equality. The bug arises when comparing the blocks. The comparison is incorrect due to a lack of consideration for block locations.

The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks have identical data but different locations. This indicates the need to revise the comparison logic within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not account for block locations, leading to incorrect block comparisons. This results in the `equals` function returning `True` in cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting criteria to ensure accurate comparisons.
2. Update the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function to consider both data equality and location.
3. Ensure that the function returns `False` when any condition for inequality is met.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly compares blocks considering both data equality and locations, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected and resolves the reported issue on GitHub.
