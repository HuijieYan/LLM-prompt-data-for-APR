### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on the equality of their attributes. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. It is reported that the function wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. It seems that the comparison is not taking the block locations into consideration, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`. Since the `mgr_locs` are not considered in the equality check of blocks, identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly detected as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the block locations (`mgr_locs`) in the equality comparison of blocks. Specifically, ensure that the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent block comparison consider the block locations to differentiate identical blocks correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the comparison of `mgr_locs` in the block equality check, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly distinguished. This fix aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
