### Buggy Function Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified Errors:
1. The `equals` function is not properly handling blocks with identical data but different locations.
2. The comparison logic for blocks and the sorting method based on type name and `mgr_locs` is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the flawed comparison logic where the function fails to properly equate blocks with the same data but different locations due to the way block equality is evaluated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the block comparison mechanism to consider block equality irrespective of their locations.
2. Adjust the sorting method to ensure correct identification of equivalent blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and the actual data to compare blocks regardless of their locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adjusts the `canonicalize` function to include the block values for comparison. It then sorts the blocks based on the type name and data values to accurately compare equivalent blocks irrespective of their locations.
