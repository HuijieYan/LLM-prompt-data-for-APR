### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances based on their axes and block data. The buggy code fails to consider the compactness of the blocks data structure which results in incorrect comparison results.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function where it sorts and compares blocks without taking into account the block locations, leading to false results.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function compares the blocks based on their data type and not their actual content.
2. Sorting the blocks without considering their locations can lead to false positives when comparing similar blocks with different locations.
3. The bug arises due to the lack of consideration for the actual block content comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on their actual content and that the comparison considers the block locations to avoid false positives.

### Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now compares blocks based on their content and locations to ensure a correct comparison and address the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
