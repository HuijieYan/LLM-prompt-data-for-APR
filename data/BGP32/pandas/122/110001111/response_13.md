### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when the blocks have the same data but different locations.

2. The potential error lies in the sorting of blocks based on their `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same data but different locations, they should not be considered equal.

3. In the provided runtime values, the function fails to return the expected output of `False` because it does not account for different block locations. It compares the blocks based on their type names and locations, leading to the incorrect equality check.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are not considered equal. One approach could be to compare block data directly instead of sorting based on type names and locations.

### Bug fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, we ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly considered equal. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should provide the expected behavior for comparing `BlockManager` objects.
