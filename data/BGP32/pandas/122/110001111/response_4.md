### Bug Analysis:
The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations.

#### Error Location:
The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. This sorting relies on the combination of the block's dtype name and its `mgr_locs` attribute. Due to unconsolidated blocks, the comparison based on `mgr_locs` leads to incorrect outcomes even if the block contents are the same.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function improperly uses the block's `mgr_locs` to distinguish blocks when `mgr_locs` may not accurately reflect the actual content. This leads to false positives/negatives in the equality comparison, as seen in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to compare the block content directly instead of relying on `mgr_locs`. By comparing the block content directly, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly recognized as equal, irrespective of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda blk: blk.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda blk: blk.dtype.name)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of blocks is based solely on their content by sorting them using `dtype.name`. This change ensures that the equality comparison is accurate and not affected by the blocks' locations within the `BlockManager` instances.
