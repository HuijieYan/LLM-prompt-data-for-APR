### Analysis:
Based on the provided information, the bug seems to stem from the `equals` function not correctly identifying the equality of `BlockManager` objects when the blocks have different locations. The function compares the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method is sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. If the blocks have the same content but different locations, this sorting method will consider them unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the comparison logic needs to be modified so that it correctly identifies equality between `BlockManager` objects even if their blocks have different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if all blocks are equal irrespective of their mgr_locs
    def block_equal(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version checks for equality between blocks without considering their locations, ensuring that the `equals` method returns the correct result.

By making these changes, the `equals` method should now behave correctly and pass the provided failing test cases.
