### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` instances. It checks if the axes of the two instances are identical and then proceeds to compare the blocks within each instance.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks, where the function fails to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations but identical contents.
3. The bug is reflected in the failing test case where the function incorrectly returns True instead of False for two `BlockManager` instances with blocks in different locations but the same contents.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks properly considers the actual content rather than just the location.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `equals` function to compare block contents instead of relying solely on the block locations.
2. Update the comparison logic to ensure that blocks with the same contents, regardless of location, are considered equal.
3. Consider sorting the blocks based on content to facilitate the comparison process.
4. Ensure that the axis comparison is still accurate.
5. Implement a robust comparison mechanism that considers the actual content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values instead of just the `mgr_locs`, the comparison now focuses on the actual block content. This correction ensures that identical blocks, regardless of their locations, are correctly identified as equal.
