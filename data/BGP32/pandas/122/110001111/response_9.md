### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
2. The bug arises when there are identical blocks with different locations, leading to the function wrongly returning `True`.
3. The bug is caused by not properly canonicalizing the block order before comparison, resulting in misleading equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. By updating the `canonicalize` function and sorting the blocks before comparison, we can address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations before comparison, the function now correctly detects cases where identical blocks with different locations should not be considered equal. This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
