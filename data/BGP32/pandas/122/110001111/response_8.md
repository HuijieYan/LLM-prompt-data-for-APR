**Analysis:**

1. The `equals` function is checking if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The buggy function is incorrectly returning `True` in some cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.

2. The potential error location is in the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might not correctly differentiate blocks with the same data but different locations.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The bug occurs because the comparison logic in the `equals` function does not account for blocks with the same data but different locations. Due to the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, blocks with equivalent data may be considered different, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to properly handle blocks with identical data but different locations. We should focus on comparing the actual block data rather than how it is stored internally.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, directly comparing their equality. This approach ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations will be correctly identified as equal, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
