### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the axes of `self` and `other`, then consolidates both instances in-place and compares their blocks.
3. The bug likely arises from incorrect block comparison, as the function does not handle blocks with identical contents but different locations correctly.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` if the blocks are not in the same order between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the improper comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect equality evaluation due to the inconsistent block order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Canonicalize the blocks in both `self` and `other` instances to ensure consistent comparison by ensuring that their positions do not affect equality evaluation.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the canonicalized blocks.
3. Sort the blocks based on the canonicalization criterion before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting and comparing blocks based on their canonical forms, this corrected version should properly handle cases where blocks have identical contents but different locations within `BlockManager` instances.
