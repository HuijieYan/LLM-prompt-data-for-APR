### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
2. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks within them.
3. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks based on their characteristics before comparing them for equality.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The sorting of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
2. Comparing the sorted blocks for equality.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent sorting of block characteristics before comparison. This might lead to incorrect results when checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparing them for equality.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the sorted blocks during the equality check.

### Bug-fixed version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consistently sorting the blocks based on `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`, the function should now correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances for equality, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
