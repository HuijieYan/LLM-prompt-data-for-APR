### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The function is attempting to sort and compare the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, however, during the sorting process, it only considers the `dtype.name` and not the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` properly. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks, causing the function to return `False` even when the DataFrames should be considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples considers both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` properly. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to utilize both attributes when sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are properly sorted and compared based on both their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, fixing the bug in the equality check.
