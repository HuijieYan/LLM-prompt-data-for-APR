### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function does not account for the block content itself, leading to incorrect comparisons. This results in the function returning `True` when it should return `False`, causing the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block content for sorting in addition to the block type and location. By creating a tuple that includes the block content, we can ensure that identical blocks are correctly recognized during comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on type, content, and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block content into the `canonicalize` function for sorting, the corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks, addressing the bug and enabling it to pass the failing test case.
