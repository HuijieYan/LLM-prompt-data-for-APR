### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a custom `canonicalize` function that relies on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue arises because the dtype of the block is being extracted incorrectly, leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks. This results in the comparison mismatch between `self` and `other`, causing the function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dtype of the block is extracted correctly within the `canonicalize` function to enable accurate sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the extraction of the dtype in the `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function should now correctly compare `self` and `other`, passing the failing test case.
