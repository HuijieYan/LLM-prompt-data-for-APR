### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of the blocks between `self` and `other` not being performed correctly due to the incorrect sorting by `canonicalize` function while comparing the blocks.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function sorts the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function which combines the block's data type name and manager locations.
2. The bug occurs when the data types are the same but the manager locations of the blocks are swapped between `self` and `other`, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks by ensuring that the manager locations are compared correctly during sorting to avoid mismatches when swapping occurs.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `tuple(block.mgr_locs.tolist())` inside the `canonicalize` function, we convert the `mgr_locs` to a comparable tuple, preserving the ordering and enabling correct block comparison. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
