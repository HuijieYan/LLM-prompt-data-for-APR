### Bug Explanation

The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` so that they can be compared properly. However, in the provided code, there is a mistake in accessing `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object. The `block` object is an instance of `IntBlock` which does not have the attribute `mgr_locs`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the different block types correctly. We should check the type of block and extract the appropriate information needed for comparison. Additionally, we should consider handling other block types that may have different attributes needed for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, None)
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
        
        # Add additional cases for other block types if needed

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes the necessary modifications in the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types appropriately and fix the bug causing the failing test.
