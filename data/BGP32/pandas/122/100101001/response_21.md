### Error:
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two BlockManagers. Even though the axes and blocks seem to match between `self` and `other`, the function fails to detect the actual difference in the data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the way the function compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Instead of comparing the content of the blocks accurately, it sorts them based on a canonicalization function that uses the dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting does not necessarily represent the actual data content comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately compares the actual content of the blocks in `self` and `other`. Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs should not be the primary comparison method.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self` with the corresponding block in `other`, ensuring that the content is compared accurately without relying on block sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
