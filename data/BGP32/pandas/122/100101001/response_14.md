### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is failing because it considers two DataFrame objects equal only if they have the same column names and data types in the same order. However, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data types and column orders, which should not be considered equal.

In the provided runtime values, the test creates DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with the following data:

- df1: {"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]}
- df2: {"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]}

These DataFrames have the same column names but different data types and values, so they should not be considered equal according to the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the buggy function `equals`, we need to modify it to compare the values within the DataFrames rather than just relying on column names and data types. We can iterate over the columns and rows to compare the values and ensure that the DataFrames are considered equal only if their values match.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    for col in self.columns:
        if col not in other.columns:
            return False
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function compares the shapes of the DataFrames and then iterates over each column to check if the values are equal. If any column has different values or is missing in one of the DataFrames, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True at the end if all values match.
