### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` are equal, but then proceeds to compare the blocks directly. This direct comparison does not consider the correct sorting of the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self` and `other` BlockManagers are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function before comparing them. This will ensure that blocks are compared accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying the fix above, the corrected version of the function should now accurately compare the blocks in `self` and `other` BlockManagers, passing the failing test.
