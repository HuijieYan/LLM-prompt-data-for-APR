### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is creating a key based on the block's data type name and manager locations, which might not accurately represent the blocks for comparison. This can lead to incorrect block ordering during comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, causing the function to return False even when the blocks are logically equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to create a key that more accurately represents the blocks for comparison. One way to achieve this is by using the block's data type, shape, and values to create a unique key for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify canonicalize to create a key based on block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.shape, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the block's values, shape, and data types as the key for sorting and comparison in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that equivalent blocks are appropriately matched, resolving the bug.
