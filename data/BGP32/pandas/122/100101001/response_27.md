### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to how the function canonicalizes blocks for comparison. The function sorts the blocks based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, but the BlockPlacement object in mgr_locs is not considered correctly.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `canonicalize` is not handling the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly. It tries to convert `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which might not produce the intended result.
2. The BlockPlacement object in `mgr_locs` is not being processed properly during comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the block information for sorting.
2. Implement a more precise comparison mechanism for `mgr_locs` to ensure accurate sorting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.block.max())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include `block.mgr_locs` and ensuring a more accurate sorting mechanism, the corrected version of the function should be able to pass the failing test.
