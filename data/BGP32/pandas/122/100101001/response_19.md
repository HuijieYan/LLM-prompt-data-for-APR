### Analysis:
The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the axes are the same, then consolidates the blocks in each object before comparing them. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison of blocks. The function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`, but the `canonicalize` function does not return the correct values.

### Error:
The `canonicalize` function is not returning the correct values to properly compare the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly represent the block's characteristics for comparison.
2. Update the sorting logic to compare the blocks properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.to_numpy().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `type(block)` and `block.to_numpy().tobytes()` to represent the blocks for comparison. This should fix the bug and ensure the comparison is done correctly.
