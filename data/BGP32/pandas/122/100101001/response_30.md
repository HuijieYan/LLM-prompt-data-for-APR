### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the sorting mechanism used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is only considering the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of each block for sorting. In the failing test case, the dataframes have columns with different data types (`int64` and `object`), causing the `equals` check to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the `dtype.name` and the actual data content of the block. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on both data type and content, making the comparison accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's values (data content), we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on both data type and content, thereby fixing the bug.
