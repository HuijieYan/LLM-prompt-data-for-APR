### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. The function compares the axes first and then sorts and compares the blocks. The bug likely occurs in the comparison of blocks, where the sorting may not be producing the correct order for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly even when the dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not equal. This is because the sorting process in `canonicalize` may not order the blocks correctly for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting in `canonicalize` function considers all aspects needed for proper comparison. In this case, we need to include both block type name and manager locations to properly differentiate between blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider both block type name and manager locations, the corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks for equality. Now the corrected function should pass the failing test without returning `True` incorrectly.
