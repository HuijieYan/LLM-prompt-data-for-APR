### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the `canonicalize` function is being implemented to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to represent the block, but the `as_array` attribute is missing in the `mgr_locs` object. This missing attribute causes an AttributeError when trying to access it, leading to the failure in the equality check.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include appropriate error handling in case `as_array` attribute is missing. Additionally, we should ensure that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are properly compared by considering their structure and content for equality.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        block_repr = (block.dtype.name, getattr(block.mgr_locs, 'as_array', block.mgr_locs).tolist())
        return block_repr

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if both block lists are equal
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By handling the attribute error in the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that the block lists are properly compared, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
