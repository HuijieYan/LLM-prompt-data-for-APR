### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects. The function first sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations but then tries to compare them using the `equals` method. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks cannot handle non-integer locations like those of ObjectBlocks. This discrepancy in handling different block types causes the function to fail when comparing DataFrame objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function can handle non-integer locations like those of ObjectBlocks. We should update the `canonicalize` function to incorporate more robust comparison mechanisms that consider the block type and location more effectively.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrame objects even when they contain different block types like ObjectBlocks.
