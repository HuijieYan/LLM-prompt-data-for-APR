### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is failing the test because it does not handle comparing DataFrames with columns in different orders correctly. The function sorts the blocks based on a combination of dtype name and manager locations but does not take into account the columns' names. This leads to incorrect comparison results when the columns are in different orders.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and the column name when sorting the blocks. This way, the function will correctly identify and compare blocks with the same dtype but different columns.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by dtype name and column name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.items.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the column names as well, the corrected function will now correctly compare DataFrames with columns in different orders and pass the failing test.
