### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises from the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function tries to create a sorted representation of a block based on its data type name and location. But the bug is due to a missing attribute access in the `canonicalize` function, causing an AttributeError when trying to access `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Bug Location
The issue is within the `canonicalize` function where `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the access to the `mgr_locs` attribute to ensure it is referring to the correct attribute within the `Block` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By correcting the access to `mgr_locs` within the `block` objects, we ensure that the `equals` function sorts the blocks correctly, addressing the bug that caused the failing test to occur.
