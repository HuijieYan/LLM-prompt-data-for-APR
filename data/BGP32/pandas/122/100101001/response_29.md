### Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.
- The function checks the equality of axes first, then consolidates both objects, and finally compares the blocks.
- In the failing test, two `DataFrames` are created with columns `a` and `b`, but the order of data differs between the two frames.

### Bug:
- The bug is in the comparison logic of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `equals` function.
- When sorting the blocks based on data type and location, the function does not consider the actual data.
- This leads to a false negative comparison result when the data order is different between the two objects.

### Suggested Fix:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to include the actual data in addition to data type and location.
- Additionally, modify the comparison logic in sorting the blocks based on actual data in addition to data type and location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By including the actual data values in the `canonicalize` function and the sorting logic, the corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
