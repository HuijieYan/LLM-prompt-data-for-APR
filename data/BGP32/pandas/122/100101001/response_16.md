### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the blocks within `BlockManager` objects. The function first checks if the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` are equal, then compares each element within these axes. However, the bug occurs when sorting the blocks within `BlockManager` objects using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting is based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes of each block to determine equality. In the failing test case provided, the blocks are sorted and compared based on these attributes, leading to a false negative result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the entire blocks directly. This will accurately determine if the `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly instead of sorting and comparing based on attributes
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the entire blocks directly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
