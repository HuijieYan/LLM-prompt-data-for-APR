### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs` attributes, which are then compared using the `equals` method. However, in the provided runtime values, the comparison of blocks is performed incorrectly due to the issue in sorting and comparing the blocks based on the `mgr_locs` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the sorting based on the `mgr_locs` attribute. The `BlockPlacement` object needs to be converted to a comparable format while sorting the blocks before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function is converted to a comparable format for sorting the blocks. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a consistent format for accurate comparison.
