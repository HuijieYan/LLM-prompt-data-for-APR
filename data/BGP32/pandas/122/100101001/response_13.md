### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to check the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of block attributes when the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The bug causes a false negative in the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` as it expects the dataframes to be not equal, but the buggy function wrongly evaluates them as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to properly consider all block attributes that uniquely identify blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct attributes are compared when sorting the blocks to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order considering all block attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.is_cake)  # Assuming `is_cake` is a unique block attribute

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering all relevant block attributes in the comparison function `canonicalize`, we ensure a proper sorting order for the blocks. This modification should correct the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test.
