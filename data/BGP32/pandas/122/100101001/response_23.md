### Bug Description:
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing two BlockManager objects by sorting their blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which extracts the dtype name and mgr_locs as a tuple. The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function uses the `mgr_locs` of each block, which might not return consistent results due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the dtype name for sorting the blocks. By removing the dependency on `mgr_locs`, we can ensure consistent comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the dtype name, we ensure that the comparison of BlockManager objects is consistent and accurate, ultimately passing the failing test.
