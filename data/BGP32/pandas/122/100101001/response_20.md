### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is occurring because the function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The comparison is based on the ordering of the blocks, which leads to a false negative result when the blocks are in a different order between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks in a more robust and accurate way, regardless of their order within the `BlockManager` objects. One approach is to iterate over each block in `self.blocks` and find a matching block in `other.blocks` based on some key (e.g., block dtype and data). This ensures that the comparison is aligned correctly and accounts for potential differences in block order.

### Corrected Version of the equals function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks within the BlockManager objects robustly
    for self_block in self.blocks:
        matching_blocks = [other_block for other_block in other.blocks if self_block.equals(other_block)]
        if not matching_blocks:
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison between `self` and `other` will accurately check for equality regardless of the block order within the `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
