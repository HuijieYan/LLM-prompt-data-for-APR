### Bug analysis:
The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted before comparison. The `canonicalize` function is using `block.dtype.name` which in this case is `'int64'` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is `[0]`. This causes the blocks to be sorted in a way that does not match the order in the test, leading to a false negative result.

### Bug fix strategy:
We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type name and the actual data values in the block to differentiate between blocks more effectively.

### Corrected version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the data type name and the actual data values of the block, ensuring a more accurate sorting for comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
