### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function first sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, but the comparison of individual blocks might not be correct.

In the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` are created with different values for columns `a` and `b`. The test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, as the values in the data frames are not the same.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` within the `equals` function. This comparison may not correctly handle the case where the values in the blocks are different, leading to incorrect equality comparisons for the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects is done correctly. One approach is to compare the block values within the `equals` function to check for equality accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block, oblock = self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]
        if block.shape != oblock.shape or not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects, comparing the shape and values of each block using `np.array_equal`. This ensures a proper comparison of the blocks, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
