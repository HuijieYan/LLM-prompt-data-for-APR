### Analysis:
The function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager instances, where the comparison includes axes and blocks. The buggy function fails to compare the blocks correctly due to the sort order, leading to false positives in the comparison.

### Identified Error Location:
The error is located in the way the blocks are sorted before comparison in the `canonicalize` function. The comparison should consider the content of the blocks, not just the order. 

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to wrongly return True even when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to prioritize the comparison based on the content of the blocks rather than their order. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content when sorting the blocks before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks based on their content before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison reflects the actual data in the blocks rather than their ordering.
