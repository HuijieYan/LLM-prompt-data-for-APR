### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. It compares the axes and blocks within the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns in different order and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method.
3. The bug is causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` objects with columns in different orders.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted based on `canonicalize` function before comparison. It can lead to wrong comparison results due to the order of data blocks.
5. To fix the bug, the blocks should be sorted based on a unique key that ensures the same order for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` method is sorting the blocks in an inconsistent manner. This leads to different sorting order for `self` and `other` blocks which results in incorrect comparison. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks by concatenating the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` representation. However, `mgr_locs` includes information about block locations which can vary for identical blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on a unique key that only depends on the block data itself, not on the locations. One way to achieve this is to use the block's data or content directly for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the blocks are now sorted based on the block's content which ensures consistent sorting order for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. This approach should fix the bug and make the comparison process accurate.
