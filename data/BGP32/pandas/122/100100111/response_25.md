### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) for equality by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are different, returns `False` if they are, then proceeds to check the equality of each axis using the `equals` method. It then consolidates both `BlockManager` objects in place and compares the blocks' lengths.
3. The bug arises when checking the equality of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`. The issue arises due to the incorrect comparison of blocks based on their dtype and locations, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, the canonicalization function needs to be modified to correctly identify the dtype and location of the blocks.
5. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case where two DataFrames with different values are expected to be considered not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the mgr_locs of the blocks for comparing equality.
2. Update the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` function to include the modified `canonicalize` function.
3. Ensure the comparison of blocks includes both dtype and mgr_locs to accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the changes as outlined above, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` objects and return the expected results.
