### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances, checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The issue arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations, where the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The test `test_dataframe_not_equal` fails as it expects `False` but gets `True` due to the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function.
4. The issue reported in GitHub relates to this incorrect behavior when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug:
The bug lies in how the function canonicalizes the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, comparing them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This leads to incorrect comparison results for blocks that have the same values but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process in a way that considers the actual contents of the blocks rather than their location information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly based on their values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the logic to compare the blocks directly, the function will accurately check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their actual content rather than their locations. This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
