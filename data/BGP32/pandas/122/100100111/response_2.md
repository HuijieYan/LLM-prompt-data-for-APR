### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks. It then sorts the blocks using a canonicalization method before comparing each block for equality. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with swapped column values and checks if `equals` returns `False`, which it should.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The comparison of axes might fail if the axes are not aligned correctly.
2. The canonicalization method might not handle unconsolidated blocks properly leading to incorrect sorting.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly handle unaligned axes and different locations of identical blocks. This causes the method to incorrectly return `True` for two `DataFrame` objects with swapped column values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Align the axes properly before comparing.
2. Improve the canonicalization method to handle unconsolidated blocks effectively.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or self_axes != other_axes:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks) or self.blocks != other.blocks:
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of axes and sorted blocks, ensuring that the failing test case mentioned (`test_dataframe_not_equal`) passes and the GitHub issue is resolved.
