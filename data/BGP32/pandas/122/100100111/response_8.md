### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of both objects are the same and then iterates over the blocks within each `BlockManager`, sorting them based on type and locations for comparison.

### Issues
1. The function does not handle the case where the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects have the same contents but different locations.
2. The comparison logic for the blocks is based on the `equals` method, but it does not consider the case where the blocks are differently located.
3. The current implementation does not fully address the requirements specified in the GitHub issue, leading to incorrect results as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. It relies only on comparing the content of the blocks, which leads to false positives when blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include the block locations when checking for equality. This change will ensure that two `BlockManager` objects are considered equal only if their blocks have the same content and are located in the same positions.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)` to the comparison condition, we address the bug and ensure that both the contents and locations of the blocks are considered during the equality check. This corrected version should pass the failing test and align with the requirements specified in the GitHub issue.
