## Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` based on their axes and blocks. It checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, if all axes are equal, and if the blocks are equal after sorting them.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the final `return` statement where the comparison logic might not match the expected behavior.

## Issue
The issue described on GitHub points out that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks but different locations. This implies that the current function is not handling the comparison of blocks with different locations properly.

## Bug Location
The bug might be located in the way the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are done. It looks like the bug stems from comparing blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality detection.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when two DataFrames have blocks with the same data but different locations. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly due to the comparison logic used in sorting the blocks.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations in its comparison. Additionally, when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we need to consider both the block's data and their locations.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if self_blocks and other_blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly handle the case where DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, which will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
