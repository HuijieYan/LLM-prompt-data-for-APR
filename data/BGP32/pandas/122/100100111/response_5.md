### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, checking if their axes are of equal length and if all corresponding blocks are equal.
2. The bug occurs because the function erroneously considers blocks with different locations identical, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` aims to check if the `equals` function correctly identifies two DataFrames as unequal, which is expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that each block's equality comparison accurately considers their types and locations within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug originates from the `canonicalize` function's incorrect comparison of blocks. It only considers the dtype of the block, neglecting the block's `mgr_locs`. As a result, blocks with different locations are falsely identified as equal, leading to incorrect results in the `equals` function.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block when sorting, ensuring blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

### Updated Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this update, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks of `BlockManager` objects while considering both the dtype and the locations of the blocks, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
