### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects in Pandas.
2. The function checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
3. It then checks if all corresponding axes are equal using a generator expression. If not, it returns `False`.
4. The function then consolidates both `self` and `other` objects inplace.
5. It compares the number of blocks in `self` and `other` objects. If not equal, it returns `False`.
6. It sorts the blocks in each object based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`.
7. It finally checks equality of corresponding blocks in `self` and `other` objects.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is not handling the comparison correctly when the blocks are identical but have different locations. The sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` can end up being different due to unconsolidated blocks with different positions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function considers blocks with different locations but identical content as equal. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on content only, without considering the block position.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a hash of block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this change, the function will sort blocks based on their content only, ignoring their positions. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct equality result.

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle cases where identical blocks are at different positions within the `BlockManager`, as was the case in the failing test provided.

This corrected function should pass the failing test case provided and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
