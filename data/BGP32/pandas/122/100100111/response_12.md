### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine equality.
2. The function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to canonicalize the block order.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different values in their columns.
4. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic when checking the equality of axes and blocks.
2. Inappropriate canonicalization method for distinguishing blocks with similar content but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison logic and canonicalization method, causing the function to return `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to correctly handle equality evaluation.
2. Revise the canonicalization method to address the issue with identical blocks in different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (repr(block),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `repr(block)` for canonicalization instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the corrected function should now properly handle the equality evaluation of blocks with different locations.
