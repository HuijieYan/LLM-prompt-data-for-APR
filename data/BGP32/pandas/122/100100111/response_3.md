### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their properties like axes and blocks.
2. The failing test compares two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with different column orders, expecting them to not be equal.
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly if the blocks have different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison checks for actual equality rather than relying on block order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` before comparing them. This sorting can cause similar blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to compare the blocks directly without any sorting.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function directly compares the blocks without sorting, ensuring that blocks with different locations are properly identified as not equal.
