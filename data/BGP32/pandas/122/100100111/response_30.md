### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are of the same length and if all axes are equal using the `equals()` method. It then consolidates both objects and compares their individual blocks.
2. The issue seems to arise when the function is trying to canonicalize the block order by sorting them based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which is a `BlockPlacement` object.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects the `equals()` method to return `False`.
4. The issue on GitHub reports the same problem where `equals()` wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The issue seems to be with the canonicalization of blocks using `BlockPlacement`, leading to wrong comparison results.

### Bug:
The bug is caused when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which includes `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to distinguish between blocks. This method of canonicalization is causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered the same, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix:
1. To fix the bug, we should avoid using locations for canonicalization as they might not provide accurate distinctions between blocks.
2. We should alter the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` for sorting the blocks, ensuring the correct ordering.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function will now only consider the `dtype.name` for sorting the blocks, ensuring that blocks with identical data types are not wrongly identified as equal.
