### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `managers.py` file compares two block managers for equality by checking axes and block content.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `test_internals.py` creates two dataframes with columns of different types and checks if calling `equals()` on them returns `False`.
3. The bug causes `equals()` to return `True` erroneously when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The issue in GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior and the expected output of the function.

### Error Location:
The error is likely in the logic for comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals()` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize()` function used for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considers block locations. Thus, even if the blocks are identical, they may get sorted differently leading to a false positive result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the sorting logic in `canonicalize()` to compare blocks without considering their locations. This change should ensure that identical blocks will be correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` function should now correctly identify that the dataframes in the failing test are not equal.
