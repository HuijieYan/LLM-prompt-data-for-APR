### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` takes two BlockManager instances `self` and `other` as input. It compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then proceeds to compare the blocks within them.
2. The issue posted on GitHub highlights a case where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` function.
3. The bug in the current implementation seems to be related to the comparison of blocks based on their order and locations.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManagers is done correctly, considering both the block content and their locations.

### Bug:
The bug appears to be in the way the `equals` function is comparing the blocks within the two BlockManagers. It seems to be sorting the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs but does not correctly handle the comparison when the blocks have similar contents but different locations. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider not just the dtype and locations of the blocks but also their content, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Creating a new method for comparing blocks
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(blocks_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By creating the `blocks_equal` function to compare blocks properly based on their content, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of BlockManagers, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
