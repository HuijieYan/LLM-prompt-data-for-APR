### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` because the data in `df1` and `df2` are not in the same order.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which might not be the correct way to compare blocks in this context.
4. To fix the bug, we should find a more appropriate way to compare the blocks rather than relying on sorting by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
5. The corrected version should compare the blocks directly by comparing their data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `equals` function to directly compare the blocks in a straightforward manner.
2. Remove unnecessary sorting and canonicalizing of blocks.
3. Compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects before comparing the blocks.
4. Modify the return condition to return `False` early if the axes are not equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Compare the axes first
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

Applying this correction should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test case provided.
