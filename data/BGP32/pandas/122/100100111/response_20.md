### Analysis:
1. The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects (self and other) for equality by checking if their axes are equal, then if each block within the BlockManager is equal using the `equals` method.
2. The buggy function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs to ensure order consistency before comparison.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having swapped types and expects the `equals` method to return False, which it fails to do currently.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are compared for equality, potentially ignoring the column types in the comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the current implementation of the `equals` method does not account for the order of columns and their data types in the comparison. It only compares the columns based on their positions within the BlockManager, leading to incorrect equality in cases where columns with different data types are swapped.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to consider both the column names and their data types. Sorting the blocks based on column names and then comparing them should ensure a proper equality check between the BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using column names and data types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the column names and data types in the sorting key, we ensure a consistent comparison based on all relevant attributes. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
