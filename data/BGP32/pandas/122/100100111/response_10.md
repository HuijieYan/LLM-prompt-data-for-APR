### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes of the two BlockManagers, sorts the blocks within each BlockManager, and then compares corresponding blocks for equality using the `equals` method.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two pandas DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having different types of data. The test expects the `equals` method to return `False` indicating the DataFrames are not equal.

### Potential error locations
1. Judging equality based on the original order of blocks without considering differences in locations.
2. Inadequate handling of different data types within the blocks.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises because the current implementation of the `equals` function does not consider the locations of blocks when comparing them for equality. This leads to scenarios where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal, as reflected in the failing test case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To address the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the locations of blocks when comparing them for equality. This can be achieved by modifying the block canonicalization process to consider both the type name and the block locations.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the block data type and the block locations for sorting blocks. This modification ensures that equal blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
