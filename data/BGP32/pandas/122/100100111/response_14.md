### Analyzing the buggy function, failing test, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue:

1. The `equals` function in the buggy file is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two different DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in corresponding columns. It expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, indicating that the DataFrames are not the same.

3. The bug is causing the `equals` function to return True incorrectly in cases where blocks have identical values but different locations. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality and has been reported as an issue on GitHub (`BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations`).

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and considers their actual content, not just their locations.

### Suggested Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Update the `equals` function to compare the content of blocks within `BlockManager` objects rather than just their locations.
2. Sort the blocks based on content to align blocks with similar content.
3. Compare the sorted blocks to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = [axis if not isinstance(axis, Index) else [axis for axis in axis] for axis in self.axes]
    other_axes = [axis if not isinstance(axis, Index) else [axis for axis in axis] for axis in other.axes]
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass as expected.
