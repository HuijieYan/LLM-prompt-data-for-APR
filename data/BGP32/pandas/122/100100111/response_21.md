### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal, which should return `False`.
3. The function fails to correctly identify the non-equality of DataFrames due to the sorting mechanism used on `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function.
2. Sorting the `blocks` without considering the order of elements within them.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the function is sorting the `blocks` based on a canonical order without considering the original order of elements within `blocks`, leading to false positives in identifying equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The fix involves modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the original order of elements within the blocks when sorting. This can be achieved by appending the individual values in addition to block attributes for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple((block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this correction should address the issue and correctly identify the non-equality of DataFrames as intended.
