### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
- The test in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` checks if the function correctly identifies when two DataFrames are not equal based on the data and axis order.
- The function compares the axes, consolidates the block managers, sorts and canonicalizes the blocks, and then checks the equality of each block.
- The issue posted on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The failing test case expects the function to return False for two DataFrames with different values and order.

### Identified Error Location:
- The issue might arise from the `canonicalize` function's implementation, where it combines the dtype name and manager locations to sort the blocks.
- The comparison may not consider the actual data within the blocks, causing the function to incorrectly return True even if the data values are different.

### Bug and Fix Strategy:
- The bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. Instead, the sorting should be based on the actual block data values.
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the data content of the block while sorting.
- By comparing actual block values instead of dtype and locations, we can accurately determine the equality of the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their actual data values and manager locations, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.
