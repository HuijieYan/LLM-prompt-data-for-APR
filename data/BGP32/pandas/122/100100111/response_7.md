### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks. The bug may lie in the comparison of blocks, potentially leading to incorrect results.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns having different types (`int` and `str`) in different positions. The expected outcome is `False` since the DataFrames are not equal.

3. The bug appears when comparing blocks of DataFrames having different columns in different positions. The DataFrame columns are reordered in a way that distinction is only possible through the iteration order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates in the block comparison logic within the `equals` function. The ordering of the blocks impacts the comparison process, leading to incorrect results despite them having the same data.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared accurately, regardless of their ordering. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks before comparison based on a unique identifier. This can be done within the `canonicalize` function which generates a unique key for each block.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on type and location within the `canonicalize` function, the correct comparison can be ensured even when the block order differs. This approach should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
