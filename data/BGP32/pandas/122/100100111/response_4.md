### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It first checks the equality of `axes`, then consolidates both `self` and `other` BlockManagers, checks the lengths of `blocks` and finally compares the blocks themselves.
2. The failing test is testing the `equals` function with two DataFrames that have columns with different data types, expecting a return value of `False`.
3. The bug causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations due to the way blocks are sorted and compared.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the actual content rather than their order. We should modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on content rather than location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return np.array(block.to_records().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the content of blocks rather than their locations, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
