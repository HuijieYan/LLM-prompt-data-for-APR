### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, checking if they are equal.
- The function first compares the `axes` of both `BlockManager` objects.
- Then, it compares each block within the `BlockManager` objects, sorting them based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.
- The issue on GitHub highlights a bug where the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for similar blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
- The bug seems to be related to how blocks are compared and sorted based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is not handling block comparisons correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
- The comparison logic based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs` is flawed, causing the function to return `True` for blocks with different locations even though they are not equal.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the block comparison logic to properly differentiate between blocks based on their content rather than just `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.
- We should ensure that similar blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if each block in the self and other BlockManagers is equal
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By updating the block comparison logic to check for equality rather than just sorting based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that similar blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
