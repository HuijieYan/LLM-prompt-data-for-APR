### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames that have columns with different types, which should result in a `False` return from the `equals` function.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in different locations, leading to incorrect True return in some cases.
- The expected values and types of variables provided give us insight into the correct behavior expected from the function.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when comparing blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists within the `equals` function.
- Due to the use of the `sorted` function with a custom key function (`canonicalize`), the blocks might get sorted differently based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, leading to incorrect comparison.
- In the failing test, the DataFrames have columns with swapped types, causing a False comparison. However, the bug is causing a True return incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by considering only the equality of block contents, irrespective of their order or type name. We should modify the comparison logic to handle blocks with swapped types properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with this corrected version, the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass as expected.
