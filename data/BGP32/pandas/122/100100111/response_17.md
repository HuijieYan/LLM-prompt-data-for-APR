### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects containing multiple blocks for equality.
2. The current implementation returns `True` if the number of blocks and the blocks themselves are equal. However, it does not consider the order of blocks or their locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.
3. The failing test tries to compare two `DataFrame` objects that have the same blocks but in different order, expecting `False` but getting `True`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the fact that the `equals` function inappropriately assumes that comparing the number of blocks and the blocks themselves is sufficient for equality. It does not consider the scenario where identical blocks can exist in different locations, leading to false positives.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` function to consider the order of blocks and their locations when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks using a canonicalization function before comparing them, ensuring a more accurate equality check.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function that considers block type and location, the corrected `equals` function will provide a more accurate comparison of `BlockManager` objects. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case provided.
