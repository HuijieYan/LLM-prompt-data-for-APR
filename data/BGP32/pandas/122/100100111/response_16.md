### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
- The function compares the axes, consolidates the managers, and then compares the blocks within the managers.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in a different order and expects them to not be equal, which is a valid expectation.

### Identified Error:
- The buggy function is incorrectly comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. It sorts the blocks by type name and location, which may lead to incorrect comparisons in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function used to define the order of blocks for comparison. If there are identical blocks with different locations, the current sorting mechanism based on type name and location may cause incorrect equalities.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- A potential fix could involve comparing the blocks without sorting them by type name and location. The focus should be on comparing the contents of the blocks directly instead of their positions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we remove the sorting of blocks based on type name and location.
- Both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are now directly used for comparison without altering their positions.
- This change avoids the issue of incorrectly assuming differences due to block locations.

By making this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
