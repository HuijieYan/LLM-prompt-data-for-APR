### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when identical blocks with different locations are considered as equal, leading to a false positive in the comparison.
3. The function compares and sorts the blocks based on a combination of dtype name and mgr_locs, which can lead to unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) being incorrectly identified as equal.
4. The buggy function does not account for the location of blocks, causing the `equals` method to falsely return True in this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual BlockPlacement `mgr_locs` instead of converting it to a list.
2. By comparing the BlockPlacement objects directly, the function will correctly identify unconsolidated blocks with different locations, resolving the false equality issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly identify and compare blocks based on their dtype name and location, resolving the false equality issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
