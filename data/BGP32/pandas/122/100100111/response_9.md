### Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by first checking if their axes are equal and then sorting and comparing their blocks. 
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects that should not be equal.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the function sorts the blocks based on their location within the `BlockManager` objects. If the blocks have the same content but are located in different positions within the `BlockManager`, the function incorrectly considers them unequal.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their locations. We can create a hash based on the values in each block to ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        hash_value = hash(block.values.data.tobytes())
        return hash_value

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the content of the blocks to generate a hash and sorting based on that hash, we ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, resolving the bug.
