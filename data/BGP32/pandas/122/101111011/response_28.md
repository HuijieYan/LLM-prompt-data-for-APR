### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block within them.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in reversed order and expects them to be unequal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
4. The runtime values and types show that the bug likely originates from how the blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` function.
5. The GitHub issue provides context that this bug causes `equals` method to wrongly return `True` when blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their content and not on their locations.
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks for sorting.
- Update the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to compare based on content rather than location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content instead of location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content instead of their locations, this corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
