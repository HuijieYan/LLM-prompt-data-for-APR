### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to check for equality between two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. The issue arises because the function does not consider the order of the blocks when performing the comparison. This leads to a scenario where two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different block order are incorrectly deemed unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the order of blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. We can achieve this by utilizing the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type name and location before performing the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue by canonicalizing the blocks before comparing them. This change ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type name and location, allowing for a proper equality comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
