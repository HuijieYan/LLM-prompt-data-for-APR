### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality, based on various attributes like axes and blocks. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1` and `df2` DataFrames, created with different column order, to be unequal. However, the buggy function might return `True` incorrectly due to mishandling of block ordering during comparison.

The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent ordering for comparison. However, if the blocks contain data that can't be distinguished by the type name and `mgr_locs` (as in the failing test), the function might mistakenly return `True`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function compares blocks based on a sorting key from `canonicalize`, but it might not be suitable for all types of blocks, resulting in 'True' returned incorrectly.
2. The comparison order of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not align, leading to an incorrect comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic considers scenarios where data within the blocks cannot be correctly distinguished by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block_repr)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._block_repr)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks using `_block_repr` as the key, which should provide a more robust and consistent comparison mechanism. This change addresses the bug identified in the failing test case.
