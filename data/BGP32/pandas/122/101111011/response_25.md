### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by their axes, blocks, and the individual blocks within them.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with columns in different orders and expects `equals` method to return `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because it expects `True is False`.
4. The runtime values show that the two block sets are being compared one-to-one, leading to the issue.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem related to the `equals` method returning True incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the implementation of comparing blocks in different order without considering the positional differences of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks considers the positions of the blocks, not just their content.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by index to consider position
    self_blocks = sorted(enumerate(self.blocks), key=lambda x: x[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(enumerate(other.blocks), key=lambda x: x[0])

    return all(
        idx_block[1].equals(other_blocks[idx_block[0]][1]) for idx_block in self_blocks
    )
```

### Conclusion:
By updating the block comparison to consider the block's positional index, the corrected version of the `equals` function is more robust and accurately reflects the equality between two `BlockManager` objects. This correction should ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` now passes successfully.
