### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to stem from sorting the blocks during comparison. Since the `sorted` function is used with a custom `canonicalize` key, this sorting might not be stable or consistent, resulting in false positives when the blocks are compared.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to inconsistent block comparison order caused by sorting blocks based on a key in the `canonicalize` function. This inconsistency leads to `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly for differing `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison order is consistent and stable across different `BlockManager` instances. One way to achieve this is by ordering the blocks based on their actual contents rather than using a sorting key based on dtype and mgr_locs that might not guarantee stable sorting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are directly compared without sorting based on a key. This change ensures that the blocks are compared in a stable and consistent order, fixing the bug that caused incorrect return values.
