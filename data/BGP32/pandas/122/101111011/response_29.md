### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises if there are identical blocks in different locations within the two dataframes being compared. Due to the comparison logic implemented - specifically the `canonicalize` function - the identical blocks with different locations are erroneously considered unequal.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `equals` method compares the axes of the current `BlockManager` instance (self) with another `BlockManager` instance (other).
- Then it consolidates both instances in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
- Subsequently, the method compares the number of blocks in both instances. If they are not equal, it immediately returns False.
- The crux of the bug occurs during the sorting process of the blocks in both instances. The `canonicalize` function typically sorts the blocks based on their data type names and manager locations.
- However, if an identical block appears in both instances but is located in a different position, due to the manager locations being distinct, the `canonicalize` function would consider them as different blocks and falsely conclude that the blocks are unequal, leading to the method erroneously returning False.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are recognized as the same blocks during the comparison process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly identified
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function compares the values and manager locations of the blocks instead of just comparing the data type name. By considering both the values within the block and their locations, identical blocks but in different positions will be recognized as equal during the comparison step, rectifying the bug.
