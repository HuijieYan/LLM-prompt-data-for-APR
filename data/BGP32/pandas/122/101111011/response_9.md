### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents (using the `equals` method of the blocks) are equal. However, the buggy implementation has a flaw in how it compares the blocks. The issue arises because the blocks are sorted based on the combination of block data type (`dtype.name`) and block locations (`mgr_locs`), which can lead to incorrect ordering, resulting in a false positive when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on a more reliable criterion that ensures the correct comparison of the blocks. We can change the sorting criteria to consider only the data type (`dtype`) of the block. This change will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and prevent false positives in the equality check.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting blocks based on dtype only
    def dtype_sort_key(block):
        return block.dtype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=dtype_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=dtype_sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the data type (`dtype`) only, we ensure that the comparison of the blocks is consistent and correct, addressing the issue of returning `True` incorrectly in the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
