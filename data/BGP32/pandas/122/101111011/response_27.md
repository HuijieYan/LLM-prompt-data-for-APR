### Identified Bug:
The buggy `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is currently incorrectly comparing blocks of DataFrame objects. It fails to differentiate between identical blocks with different locations, leading to false positives when determining equality between DataFrames. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to not behave as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the sorting mechanism within the `equals` function that is based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses the block's type name and `mgr_locs` as an array to sort the blocks which can lead to incorrect ordering of blocks, especially when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function to consider only the type of block and not the locations. By removing the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` part from the `canonicalize` function, we prevent different block locations from affecting the order of blocks during the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using only the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to only consider the block's type name, we prevent incorrect ordering based on block locations. This modification will ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares DataFrames based on block content without being affected by block locations.
