### Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. Specifically, the bug arises when comparing blocks with different locations but the same data. The function `equals` sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparing them. However, since the location data is different, even though the actual data is the same, the comparison incorrectly states that the DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to focus solely on the data within the blocks and not consider the locations when determining equality.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the function compares blocks based on their data content only, rather than considering the block locations. This change avoids the issue where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly considered as not equal.
