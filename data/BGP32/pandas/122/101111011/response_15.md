### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the axes of both instances are the same, followed by comparing the blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed as each block's equality is dependent on sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type and the manager locations (not the actual block content).
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with the same columns but different values and expects them not to be equal. When calling the `equals` method on these dataframes, it incorrectly returns `True`.
- The error message points out that the assertion failed because `True` was inferred to be equal to `False`, indicating the incorrect return value of the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic within the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks based on just the data type and manager locations, we should compare the block content directly. This change will ensure that the blocks are checked for equality based on their actual data, not their metadata.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Note:
The key change in the corrected version is removing the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function and directly comparing the blocks for equality. This change ensures that the actual block content is used for the comparison, fixing the bug and making the `equals` function work as expected.
