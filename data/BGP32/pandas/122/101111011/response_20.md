### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. This method is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The failing test is comparing two `DataFrame` instances using the `equals` method, which triggers the faulty comparison logic.
3. The error is caused by not considering the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances during equality comparison, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks in each `BlockManager` does not affect the equality comparison result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` method to consider the order of blocks within each `BlockManager`.
2. Canonicalize the order of blocks based on block type and locations to ensure consistent comparison.
3. Sort both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them in the last step to account for block order differences.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` method should properly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances, taking into account the order of blocks within them. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
