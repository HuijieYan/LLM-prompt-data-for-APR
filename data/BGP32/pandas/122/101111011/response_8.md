### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `BlockManager` checks if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and locations. The failure is due to the comparison logic not handling the case where identical blocks have different locations.

2. The comparison is based on sorting blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`, which might fail to identify blocks that are equal but differ in locations. This sorting method leads to incorrect comparison results.

3. The failing test case creates two dataframes where columns are interchanged, resulting in identical blocks but different locations. The buggy function incorrectly returns `True` for equality, causing the assertion error. The runtime values show the issue with sorted blocks.

4. To fix the bug, modify the comparison logic to account for identical blocks with different locations. One approach is to compare blocks based on content equality, disregarding the locations during the comparison.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the fixed version, instead of sorting blocks based on type name and location, the function directly compares the blocks for equality, ensuring that blocks with the same content are identified as equal. This modification addresses the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
