### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing the dataframe blocks without considering the locations of the blocks. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when the block values are identical but the locations differ.
2. The comparison logic should include considering the block locations to ensure accurate equality checks for the dataframes.
3. In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have the same data but different column orders. The buggy `equals` function does not handle this correctly, leading to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations as part of the comparison key.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `equals` function below. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order including locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations, the corrected `equals` function will now accurately compare dataframes based on their block data and locations, resolving the issue.
