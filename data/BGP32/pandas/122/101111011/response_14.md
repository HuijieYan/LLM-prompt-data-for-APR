### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables. The comparison logic should include a check for block locations to determine equality correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Incorporate block location comparison within the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks in different locations are not falsely identified as equal.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider both block data type and location for a more accurate equality check.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the location of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing both the data type and the block location within the `equals` function, we ensure an accurate determination of equality between blocks in different DataFrame objects.
