### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the fact that the function incorrectly compares the blocks in different locations as equal even when they have different content. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `['a', 'b']` but with swapped values. The expected outcome is for `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` indicating that the two dataframes are not equal. However, the current implementation wrongly returns `True`, failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in a way that correctly identifies when blocks are not equal based on their content, taking into consideration their actual values and not just their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The updated code compares the actual contents of the blocks to determine equality rather than solely relying on their location.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the blocks are being compared based on actual content rather than their locations. This adjustment should resolve the bug and correctly identify when two dataframes are not equal even if their blocks are located differently.
