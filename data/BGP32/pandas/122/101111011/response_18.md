### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality, but it fails to correctly determine equality in certain cases.
2. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then proceeds to compare their blocks. The issue arises when the blocks have the same content but are arranged differently.
3. In the failing test function, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrame instances `df1` and `df2` are created with shuffled values in columns. The test asserts that calling `equals` on them should return `False`, but it fails due to the bug in the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the content rather than the order. One approach is to sort the blocks based on their content during comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this fix, the comparison of blocks is based on the content and location, rather than just the location, which resolves the issue observed in the failing test.
