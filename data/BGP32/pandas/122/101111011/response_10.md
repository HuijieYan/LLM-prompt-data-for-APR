### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by sorting their `blocks` attribute, which may result in different blocks being considered equal due to differences in location.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns swapped and expects them to be unequal, triggering a failure due to the bug in the comparison logic of the `equals` function.
3. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it returns `True` when it should be `False`, leading to the assertion error.
4. The runtime analysis shows that the bug lies in the comparison of the blocks' content without considering their locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare blocks while considering both their content and locations to ensure an accurate equality check.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for differentiating blocks with the same content.
3. Modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to use the revised `canonicalize` function for accurate sorting and comparison.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the comparison logic to consider block locations in addition to content, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now provide the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
