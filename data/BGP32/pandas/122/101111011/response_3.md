### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the order of block comparison. The comparison logic compares blocks in a sorted order using `canonicalize` function, which combines the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` representation of each block. However, the bug arises from the fact that for different blocks containing the same datatype but at different locations, the comparison fails because the `mgr_locs` themselves can be different even if the content inside the blocks is the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to directly check the equality of blocks without sorting them based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison will directly check the equality of each block in the same order without performing any sorting based on dtype or `mgr_locs`, fixing the bug.
