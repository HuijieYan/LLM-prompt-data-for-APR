### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by their axes, blocks, and their elements. However, the comparison mechanism is flawed.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different column values and expects `equals` to return False, but due to the flawed comparison, it returns True erroneously.
3. The error message shows an assertion failure, indicating that the comparison result was opposite to what was expected. It highlights the dataframe contents and the `equals` method invocation point.
4. The branch of conditions checking axes lengths, individual axis equality, and block counts seem fine. The issue lies in how the blocks are compared using the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect results.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly in the `equals` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, consider the following steps:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their shared properties like dtype and locations.
2. Sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the updated `canonicalize` function.
3. Compare the sorted blocks to ensure equality.
4. Return the comparison result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to sort blocks based on dtype and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the comparison mechanism in the `equals` method as outlined above, the fixed function should now return the expected results, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
