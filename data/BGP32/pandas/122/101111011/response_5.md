### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks located differently. The issue arises from the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks, which doesn't consider block locations. The bug violates the expected behavior indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to consider block locations along with data types. By including block locations in the sorting criteria, we can ensure that DataFrames with identical blocks located differently are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the sorting key, the corrected version of the `equals` function can properly identify DataFrames with identical blocks located differently as unequal, resolving the bug.
