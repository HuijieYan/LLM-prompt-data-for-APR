### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on the equality of their axes, blocks, and block order. The bug arises from the fact that a sorting mechanism is used to compare block order, where the key function `canonicalize` relies on comparing the block's data type and `mgr_locs`. However, `mgr_locs` in this context is not a unique indicator of block equality, leading to incorrect comparison results and causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it uses a more suitable and accurate representation of block identity for sorting. We can make use of the block's actual content or metadata instead of relying solely on `mgr_locs`, to provide a better basis for comparing block equality.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use content-based comparison for blocks
    self_blocks = [(block.to_wide_dict(), block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.to_wide_dict(), block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks]

    # Sort based on content and then compare
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()

    return all(
        block_data1.equals(block_data2) for (block_data1, _), (block_data2, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures a more accurate block comparison by using block content alongside `mgr_locs`. By sorting based on content and then comparing the blocks, we can address the issue of wrongly returning `True` in cases where blocks have different locations.
