### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the bug arises from how the function handles the sorting of blocks to compare them. The key function `canonicalize` is meant to create a comparable representation for each block based on its data type and locations. The issue occurs because the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` is accessed incorrectly, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the access to the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` in the `canonicalize` function. It is important to ensure that the correct attribute is being accessed to create a consistent and comparable representation for each block. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to be accurate when comparing the sorted blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the fix applied:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By correcting the access to `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison of blocks should now be accurate, resolving the bug that caused the failing test.
