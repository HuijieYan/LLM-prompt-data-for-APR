### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The buggy function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If not, it returns `False`. Then, it iterates over `self_axes` and `other_axes` to compare each axis. After that, it consolidates both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects in place. It checks if the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are equal. Finally, it sorts the block lists based on a user-defined function `canonicalize`, which uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to form a tuple for comparison.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the case where two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are created with columns `a` and `b` swapped. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` because the dataframes are not equal.
4. The bug occurs because the sorting mechanism inside the function is using `canonicalize` function that includes the `mgr_locs` of the blocks. As the `mgr_locs` might differ even if the data is the same, causing the incorrect comparison.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify `canonicalize` function to compare blocks solely based on data type information without including the `mgr_locs`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name  # Only consider dtype for canonicalization

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name`, the function will compare blocks based on data type information only, effectively fixing the bug.
