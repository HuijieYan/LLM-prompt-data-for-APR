### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class not correctly comparing two DataFrames based on their blocks. The function compares the blocks of the two DataFrames in a sorted order based on the block's data type and manager locations. However, in some cases, even if the blocks have the same data, the locations might be different due to the order of sorting, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks based on their data values rather than sorting them and comparing based on the dtype and locations. This will ensure that we are truly comparing the content of the blocks rather than their ordering.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the function that compares the blocks based on their values:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks' values without sorting them based on dtype and locations, we ensure that the function correctly identifies if two DataFrames are equal regardless of the block order.

This should fix the bug and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
