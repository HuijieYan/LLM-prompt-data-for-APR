### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects, checking if they have the same number of axes and equal axes. It then proceeds to consolidate the internal data structures of both objects. The bug arises from incorrectly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The comparison function `canonicalize` sorts the blocks based on their data type and location. However, the bug occurs because the location of the blocks is not normalized before comparison, resulting in identical blocks with different locations being considered unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that before comparing the blocks, their locations are normalized. This normalization should consider the relative order of the blocks as opposed to absolute locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.values))  # Normalize block values
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the blocks are sorted based on their data type and normalized values, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations will be considered equal. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
