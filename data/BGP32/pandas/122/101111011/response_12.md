### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects based on their order, which causes the comparison to fail. The bug arises because the order in which blocks are stored in memory may differ between instances due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical ones.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on content rather than their position in memory. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content before comparing, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now properly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
