### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The failing test function is testing the equality of two DataFrames using the `equals` method, but it is expecting the result to be `False` because the data in the DataFrames is not the same.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because `True is False`, which means that the equality check is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
  
### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares blocks in the `BlockManager`. When sorting and comparing the blocks, the function does not take into account the block locations, leading to incorrect equality checking.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method needs to be updated to consider block locations along with the block type name when sorting and comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # consider block locations
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block locations when sorting the blocks, the `equals` method will now correctly handle cases where blocks with identical contents but different locations are compared.
