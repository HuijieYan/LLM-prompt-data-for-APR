### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in the `test_internals.py` file creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and calls the `equals()` function to check if they are equal.
3. The error message shows that the test failed because it expected the comparison to return False but received True.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `equals()` function returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function compares blocks based on their content and does not take into account the different locations of blocks within the object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to consider both the content of blocks and their locations when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using both type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.iteritems()))
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the updated `equals()` function considers both the content of blocks and their locations when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
