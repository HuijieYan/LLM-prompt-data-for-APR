### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two instances. The function is supposed to compare the internals of two `BlockManager` instances for equality, but it fails to do so.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different column order and values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method. However, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The error message points out that `assert True is False` because the `df1.equals(df2)` call is returning `True`, which is incorrect.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem where the `equals` method is wrongly returning `True` even when comparing dataframes with different column orders.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not correctly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. It sorts the blocks based on the block type and manager locations, which does not guarantee correct comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `equals` function should compare the blocks directly instead of iterating over sorted blocks. This direct comparison will correctly identify differences regardless of block order or type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, the `equals` function will now compare two `BlockManager` instances correctly and will pass the failing test.
