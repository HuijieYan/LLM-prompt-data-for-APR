### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of two DataFrame objects correctly, leading to a false positive result.
2. The error is caused by the incorrect comparison of dataframe blocks due to different block locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is highlighting this issue by expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but the buggy function is returning `True`.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison of dataframe blocks takes into account not just block content but also the block locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations to differentiate blocks correctly.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider both block contents and block locations.
3. Reorder blocks based on the updated canonicalization before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# Fix the equals method in the BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, including block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations in the canonicalization process, the corrected version of the `equals` method will now correctly handle DataFrame comparisons, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
