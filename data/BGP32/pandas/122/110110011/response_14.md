### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, located in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking the equality of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method.
3. The failing test is giving the error "assert True is False", which indicates that the two DataFrames are incorrectly considered equal by the current implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.
5. The bug seems to be arising from the sorting of blocks and comparing them in the `equals` method, where the comparison doesn't take the block locations into account.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method occurs because the function fails to consider the block locations while checking the equality of blocks. This leads to incorrect behavior when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations while comparing blocks. This modification should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.as_array.equals(oblock.mgr_locs.as_array)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block locations in the comparison, ensuring that blocks are considered unequal if their locations differ. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave correctly.
