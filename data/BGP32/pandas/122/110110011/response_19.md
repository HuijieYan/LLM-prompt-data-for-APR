### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` defined in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test is testing the `equals` method on two DataFrames that have the same data but in different order. The test expects the result to be `False`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion is failing because `True is False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where `DataFrame.equals()` is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
   
### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the DataFrame axes.
2. Handling consolidation of blocks.
3. Sorting blocks before comparison.
4. Checking for equality of each block.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `equals` method does not handle scenarios where the blocks are identical but in different locations. The equality check fails due to the order of blocks or their internal representation. This results in the method returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent axis comparison.
2. Properly consolidate blocks before comparison.
3. Sort blocks based on a canonical representation.
4. Compare each block individually for equality.
   
### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
            
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Changes Made:
1. Used `_typ` attribute in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Updated sorting of blocks based on `_typ` for proper comparison.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly handle scenarios where identical blocks are compared in different locations and return the expected result.
