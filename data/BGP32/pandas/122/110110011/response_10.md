### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` asserts that two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal using the `equals` method, but the assertion fails.
3. The error message indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" confirms the incorrect behavior for the `equals` method when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
5. The bug is likely caused by not considering the block locations while comparing two DataFrames.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method arises from not taking into account the locations of identical blocks when comparing two DataFrames. As a result, even if the block content is the same, the comparison fails if the block locations are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider both the content of the blocks and their locations while comparing two DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs, oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now includes checking the block locations (`mgr_locs`) alongside comparing the actual block content. This modification ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
