### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it fails with an assertion error.
4. The error message shows that the method `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`.
5. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" reports a similar problem in the `equals` method.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `equals` method where it compares the blocks by iterating through them and using a canonicalization function to sort them.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not considering the case where blocks are identical but have different locations. Due to the sorting logic based on the block metadata, it fails to correctly identify the equality of DataFrames.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to handle cases where blocks have identical data but different memory locations. This can be achieved by comparing the actual data within the blocks instead of relying on the block metadata.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, we ensure that the DataFrames are correctly determined as equal or not based on their actual data rather than metadata. This approach should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
