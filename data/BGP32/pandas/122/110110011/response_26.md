## Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class from `managers.py` is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the issue when `DataFrame.equals` incorrectly returns `True` when two dataframes have different data.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it expects `True` to be `False`.
- The GitHub issue highlights the same problem, where `equals` method returns incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations.

## Error Location
The bug seems to be in the logic of the `equals` method where the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using `block.equals(oblock)` might lead to incorrect results due to different block locations within the same data.

## Cause of the Bug
- The issue arises because the comparison of blocks is based on both datatype name and `mgr_locs` of blocks.
- However, when two identical blocks have different `mgr_locs`, the comparison fails even though the contents are the same, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- One possible solution is to compare block contents as well as block locations. Since the current implementation relies too heavily on the block locations, which can cause issues, a change in the comparison logic is necessary.
- A more robust comparison strategy that considers block contents and structure would be required to fix this bug and allow correct equality comparisons.

## Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on the byte representation of their values, ensuring that blocks with identical content will be considered equal regardless of their original locations.
