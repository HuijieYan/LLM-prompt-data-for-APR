### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class within the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file is checking the `equals` method for DataFrame objects.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, returning `assert True is False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`. The GitHub issue provides additional context on this bug.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison of DataFrame blocks with different locations but the same values, leading to an incorrect evaluation of equality.
5. To fix this bug, the `equals` method needs to consider block locations in addition to values for the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to take block locations into account during the comparison.
2. Use a consistent sorting approach for aligning blocks between the two DataFrames to ensure accurate comparison.
3. Update the canonicalization function to include block locations to properly distinguish blocks.
4. Modify the comparison step to consider both block values and their locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering both block values and their locations in the comparison step, the corrected `equals` method should now accurately determine the equality of two DataFrames even when the block locations differ.
