### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file within the pandas library.
2. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in `test_internals.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
4. The GitHub issue reports the expected behavior as returning `False` for identical blocks with different locations using `equals` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` function compares blocks in `BlockManager` even when they have different locations. The sorting logic and comparison based on block properties lead to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare blocks within `BlockManager` based on their content instead of their locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x.values.tostring()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(x.values.tostring()))

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version compares the block values directly using `equals` method instead of sorting based on dtype and locations. This fix should resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
