### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class.
   
2. **Buggy Class**: The `BlockManager` class is a core internal data structure in pandas for managing labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.

3. **Failing Test**: The `test_dataframe_not_equal` test function is failing as the `equals` method is not correctly identifying when two DataFrames are not equal.

4. **Error Message**: The error message shows that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, indicating that the `df1.equals(df2)` call is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

5. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue relates to the bug in the `equals` method where it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, where unconsolidated blocks may not be correctly compared based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs. This results in wrongly identifying DataFrames as equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is based on a complete representation of the blocks, including their dtype.name and mgr_locs. This involves updating the `canonicalize` function to provide a more accurate representation for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version updates the `canonicalize` function to compare the block values directly along with the manager locations for the blocks, ensuring a more accurate check for equality between DataFrames having blocks in different locations.

### After applying this fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass when comparing the two DataFrames.
