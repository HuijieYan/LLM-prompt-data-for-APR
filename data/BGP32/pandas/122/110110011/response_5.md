### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is buggy.
- **Buggy Class**: The `BlockManager` class manages a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.
- **Failing Test**: The test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two dataframes are not equal. It fails when comparing dataframes with different values in the columns.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because `True` is not equal to `False`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations in dataframes.

### Error Analysis:
- The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class fails to correctly compare dataframes when their values are different but the blocks have identical shapes.
- The issue arises from sorting and comparing the blocks by their dtype name and manager locations, which may lead to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to check for identical blocks correctly.
- Use a more accurate criterion for determining block equality, e.g., comparing values in the blocks directly.
- Update the sorting and comparison logic to ensure correct equality comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks_values()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks_values()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is done based on their actual values rather than just dtype names and manager locations. Additionally, the `get_blocks_values` method should retrieve the block data correctly for comparison.
