### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class checks for equality between two instances based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - Comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` might not be correct.
   - Sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be problematic.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   The current implementation of the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class doesn't handle the order of axes and blocks correctly. When comparing the data frames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test, the method fails to identify the differences in block locations and incorrect axes order, leading to a false positive result.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Ensure that the axes are correctly compared between `self` and `other`.
   - Properly handle the sorting and comparison of blocks to consider block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `equals()` method with this corrected version, the issue of wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations should be resolved.
