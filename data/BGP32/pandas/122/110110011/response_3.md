### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
   
2. **Relationship**:
   - Buggy function is a method of the `BlockManager` class.
   - Failing test code (`test_dataframe_not_equal`) calls the `equals` method by creating two instances of `pd.DataFrame`.
   - Corresponding error message indicates that the comparison performed by the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
   - Corresponding GitHub issue points out the incorrect behavior of `equals` in scenarios where blocks have different locations.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The `equals` method first checks if the axes in the two `BlockManager` instances are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False`. This part appears to be working correctly.
   - The bug lies in the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The method compares the blocks using the `equals` method which is not handling cases where the blocks have equal values but different locations.
   - This causes the method to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks are in different locations.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - The comparison between blocks should consider the values as well as the locations to determine equality correctly.
   - One approach could be to iterate over the blocks and compare the content of each block along with the locations to ensure accurate equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks with values and locations
    comparison_result = [
        block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ]

    return all(comparison_result)

``` 

By incorporating `np.array_equal` to compare block values along with the existing `equals` method to compare block objects, the corrected version ensures that block equality is checked correctly in terms of values and locations.
