### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. In the failing test, the `equals` method is called on two `DataFrame` instances, which internally utilize `BlockManager`. This mismatch causes the failing test.
2. The potential error locations are in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.
3. The cause of the bug is due to comparing the `BlockManager` objects directly instead of comparing the data within them. This leads to incorrect equality checks and the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be modified to compare the content of the `BlockManager` objects rather than the objects themselves.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected `equals` function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    if len(self_data) != len(other_data):
        return False
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data) 
        for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_data, other_data)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function now compares the data within the blocks of the `BlockManager`, ensuring that it correctly checks for equality.

By using `np.array_equal()` function, we can compare the values within the blocks efficiently.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
