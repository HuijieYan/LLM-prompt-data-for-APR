### Analysis:
- The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the equality comparison of two `DataFrame` objects using the `equals` method.
- The error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion to fail.
- The GitHub issue identifies a bug in the `equals` method where it wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely occurring due to the sorting logic in the `equals` function. Two `BlockManager` objects can have identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison results.
- The use of the `canonicalize` function for sorting blocks might not consider different block locations, resulting in `equals` returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug:
- Update the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations in addition to block content when sorting.
- This change should ensure that even if the blocks have the same content, different locations will result in a `False` comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to consider block locations as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # Considering block locations
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This should resolve the bug identified in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
