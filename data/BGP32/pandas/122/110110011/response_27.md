### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to check the equality between two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts and canonicalizes them, and finally checks if all the blocks are equal.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with columns in different order and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method. The assertion fails.
4. The error occurs because the `equals` method does not handle the case where the blocks have the same values but are in a different order.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` method not handling the scenario where blocks with identical values are arranged differently.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider the values of the blocks rather than their order, since the blocks can be equivalent even if their order is different.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.items)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.items)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Now, the updated function compares blocks based on their values rather than order of occurrence.

### Note:
Ensure to update the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their items or values to handle cases where values are identical but the order is different.
