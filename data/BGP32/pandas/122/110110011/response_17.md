### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` from the `pandas/tests/internals/` directory checks if the DataFrame `df1` is not equal to `df2` using the `equals` method, which should return False.
3. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to True, indicating that the `equals` method is not functioning correctly.
4. The GitHub issue details that when testing on identical blocks with different locations, the `equals` method wrongly returns True instead of False.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method stems from the improper comparison of internal blocks within the `BlockManager` class, particularly in cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations. This causes the method to incorrectly evaluate the equality and return True when it should return False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` method to consider the content and location of the underlying blocks within the `BlockManager` class correctly. The comparison should account for both identical content and matching locations to determine equality accurately.

### Updated Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By incorporating the corrected logic in the `equals` method, the comparison will now accurately determine the equality between `BlockManager` instances based on both the content and location of internal blocks. This updated version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
