### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects with different values in their columns and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, which should return False.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, showing that the `equals` method is returning True incorrectly.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning True for DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method is caused by comparing blocks based only on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. It does not consider the actual data within the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons for DataFrame objects with identical blocks in different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be updated to consider the actual data within the blocks when checking for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the comparison logic to sort blocks based on their values when checking for equality, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
