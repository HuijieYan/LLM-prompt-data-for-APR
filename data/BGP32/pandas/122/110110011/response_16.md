### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different content and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion failed (`assert True is False`) because the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem where `equals` wrongly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrame blocks with identical content but different locations.
5. The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly due to the order in which they are sorted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks and compares them. The issue arises from using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which leads to different locations being considered as different blocks, even if the content is the same.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are canonicalized so that identical blocks with different locations are considered the same. One approach is to use the content of the blocks for comparison instead of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()  # Compare block content

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above modification, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than their locations, resolving the bug.
