### Bug Analysis:
- **Buggy Function:** The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the DataFrame blocks correctly, resulting in incorrect equality checks.
- **Relationship with Buggy Class:** The `BlockManager` class is a core internal data structure to manage labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays for Pandas objects like DataFrame or Series.
- **Corresponding Test:** The `test_dataframe_not_equal` test is expecting two DataFrames with different column order to not be equal, but due to the bug, the assertion fails.
- **Error Message:** The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with an output indicating that the difference is wrongly treated as True.
- **GitHub Issue:** The GitHub issue highlights a similar case where the `equals` method returns True even for DataFrames with different block locations.

### Bug Location:
1. The bug is primarily located in the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.
2. Specifically, the comparison of block equality is not handled correctly, leading to erroneous results.

### Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug lies in the way the `equals` function compares the blocks of data.
- When comparing self and other blocks, the function fails to consider different block locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the blocks based on content rather than their locations.
- Use a sorting strategy to compare blocks while considering the structure and data of each block to ensure accurate equality checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tostring(), block.values.dtype.name)  # Consider values and type for block comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.tolist() == oblock.values.tolist() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Correction Strategy Explanation:
- The corrected version uses a `canonicalize` function that takes block values and their type into account for sorting.
- Sorting based on block values allows comparing blocks without considering their locations, addressing the root cause of the bug.
- The comparison now directly compares the block content using `tolist()` to ensure accurate equality checks.
- By comparing values rather than locations, the corrected version provides a more robust equality check for DataFrames.
