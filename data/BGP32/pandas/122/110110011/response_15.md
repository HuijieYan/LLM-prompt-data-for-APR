### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two dataframes with columns in different order and expects them to not be equal.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals()` method is returning `True` incorrectly in some cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function within the `equals()` method which sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting is done to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly, but it fails to account for cases where the blocks have different values but still considered equal. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `equals()` method to handle cases where blocks have different values but are still considered equal. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, we need to compare the block values within each block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=id)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=id)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the `values` attribute of each block, we ensure that the block values are compared for equality rather than the block objects themselves. This should fix the bug and make the `equals()` method work as expected.
