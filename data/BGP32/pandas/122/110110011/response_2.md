### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `equals`, is a part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The failing test function, `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`, is checking if two DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True`.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, showing that `True` is not equal to `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that `equals` wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
5. The bug seems to be in the logic of comparing blocks within the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. When comparing the blocks of two DataFrames, the comparison should consider not just the contents but also their locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the blocks with respect to both content and locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the comparison considers both block equality and block locations, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
