### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` class objects to check if they are equal.
3. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders and expects them to be not equal, which is correct.
4. The test fails with the assertion error because the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases where blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how the blocks are canonicalized and then compared. If the blocks have the same content but different internal locations, the comparison fails to recognize their equality.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to come up with a way to compare blocks for equality regardless of their internal locations. One approach could be to compare the content of the blocks directly. We may need to modify the `canonicalize` function and the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    return all(block_equals(b1, b2) for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the blocks without considering their internal locations. It should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
