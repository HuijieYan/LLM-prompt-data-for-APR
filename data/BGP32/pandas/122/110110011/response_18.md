### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
2. The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
3. The error message states that `assert True is False`, which indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem where `equals` wrongly returns `True` when blocks have different locations but are identical.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing two block managers. It fails to correctly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations. This leads to the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` function to appropriately handle cases where blocks have different locations but are identical.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function should handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
