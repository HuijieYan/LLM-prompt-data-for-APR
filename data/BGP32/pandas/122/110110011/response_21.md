### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
   
2. **Buggy Class:** The `BlockManager` class is responsible for managing labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays for use in DataFrame, Series, etc.

3. **Failing Test:** The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames that have columns with swapped data values.

4. **Error Message:** The error message indicates an assertion failure because the `equals` method is returning `True` when it is expected to return `False`.

5. **GitHub Issue:** The GitHub issue describes the problem where the `equals` method falsely returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function attempts to compare blocks in the `BlockManager` instances by sorting them based on dtype name and manager locations, but it fails to correctly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the approach for comparing the block data to ensure accurate equality checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if number of blocks with the same type and data are equal
        self_blocks = {}
        other_blocks = {}
        for block in self.blocks:
            key = (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.data.tobytes()))
            self_blocks[key] = block
        for block in other.blocks:
            key = (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.data.tobytes()))
            other_blocks[key] = block
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if the blocks are equal
        for key in self_blocks:
            if key not in other_blocks:
                return False
            if not self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version introduces a new approach to compare blocks based on a combination of dtype name and hashed data bytes to identify unique blocks. This modified logic ensures proper equality checking even for identical blocks with different locations.
