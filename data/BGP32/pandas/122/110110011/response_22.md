### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error might occur when comparing the data blocks within the `equals` method.

3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` that have different values in their columns `a` and `b`.
   - The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class fails to correctly identify the data blocks mismatch and erroneously returns true when the data is actually not equal.
   - The error message indicates that the assertion fails where `True` is compared to `False`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - The `canonicalize` function is intended to order the blocks for comparison, but it may not be working as expected.
   - The data type and locations of blocks should be compared accurately in the `equals` method to determine equality.
   - Making sure that the comparison handles different data values appropriately is essential.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block by converting to values
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After fixing the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class as shown above, the corrected version should adequately compare the blocks' values for equality.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
