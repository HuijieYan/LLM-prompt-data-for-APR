### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two objects of type `BlockManager` for equality. The buggy function accesses attributes like `self.axes`, `other.axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` to perform the comparison.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `test_internals.py` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values and asserts that they are not equal using the `equals()` method.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the `equals()` method falsely returned `True`.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True`.
5. The bug occurs in the comparison logic where blocks are sorted based on a tuple of type name and locations which can cause inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect sorting and equality comparison in the `BlockManager.equals()` function. When sorting blocks based on type name and locations, the order of blocks can be different even if the contents are identical, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should focus on comparing the blocks directly rather than sorting them based on type name and locations. This change will ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` method will directly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances for equality, ensuring that identical data results in a `True` return value.
