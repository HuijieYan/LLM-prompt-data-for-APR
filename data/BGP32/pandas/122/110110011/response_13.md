### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas.core.internals` module is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file of the `pandas.tests.internals` module creates two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types in opposite order and asserts that they are not equal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion in the failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because the `equals` method of the DataFrame returns `True` unexpectedly.
4. The linked GitHub issue points out that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations, which is the cause of the failure.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method considers both the data type names and the block locations of the blocks in the BlockManager objects.

### Bug Reason:
The bug exists in the `equals` method where it compares sorted blocks from two `BlockManager` objects without considering the block locations. Due to this, even if the blocks are identical but have different locations, the method returns `True`, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method to include both the data type name and the block locations while sorting the blocks. This modification will ensure that the comparison considers both factors, resolving the incorrect equality comparison issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))  # Include mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` method should correctly compare the two `BlockManager` objects for equality, passing the failing test and resolving the reported issue.
