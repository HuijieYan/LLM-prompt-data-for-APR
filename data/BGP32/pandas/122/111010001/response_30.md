1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two DataFrames for equality. The function checks if the axes, blocks, and block contents of two DataFrames are equal.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The comparison of axes lengths.
   - Call to `_consolidate_inplace` function for self and other objects.
   - Comparison of the number of blocks.
   - Sorting and comparison of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
   - Comparison of individual blocks.

3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True is False`, which is incorrect.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the two DataFrames are considered not equal if any of the comparisons fail. We should also ensure proper handling of different data types and block order.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts().keys(), block.get_ftype_counts().keys())

    self_blocks = sorted(list(map(canonicalize, self.blocks)), key=lambda x: x[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(list(map(canonicalize, other.blocks)), key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the two DataFrames are compared properly based on axes, blocks, and block contents. It also handles different data types and block order appropriately.
