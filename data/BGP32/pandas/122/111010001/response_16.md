### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
   
2. The `equals` method checks if two BlockManager objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True` instead of `False`.

### Locating potential errors

1. The buggy function sorts the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects before comparing them.
   
2. While comparing, it is using the `equals` method of the `Block` class to check if two blocks are equal.

### Explaining the bug

1. The bug occurs because the `equals` method of the `Block` class in pandas doesn't handle the case of comparing different types correctly.

2. When `Block` objects of different types are compared, the comparison fails and returns `False`, causing the overall comparison of `BlockManager` objects to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle different types of blocks more robustly.
   
2. Update the comparison logic in the buggy function to check if the blocks are of the same type before calling the `equals` method on them.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if type(block) == type(oblock) else False
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding the check for the block types in the comparison logic, the corrected function ensures that only blocks of the same type are compared using the `equals` method, addressing the bug present in the initial implementation.
