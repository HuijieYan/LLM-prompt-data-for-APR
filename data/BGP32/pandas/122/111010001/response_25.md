### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class which is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts the blocks, and then checks the equality of each block.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison of two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` fails when calling the `equals` method.
4. The bug may be caused by the incorrect sorting of the blocks and checking for equality.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparing the equality.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Add a `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class to correctly sort and compare the blocks.
2. Modify the `equals` method to sort the blocks using the `canonicalize` function before checking for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize and sort blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks in the `equals` method before comparing them, the corrected version ensures that the blocks are ordered consistently for accurate equality comparison.
