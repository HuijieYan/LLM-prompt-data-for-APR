### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The method compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates the blocks within both objects, sorts the blocks based on type and location, and finally compares the sorted blocks for equality.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, which suggests that the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are considered equal by the `equals` method, even though they are not equal.
4. The bug is likely in the sorting of blocks based on the type and location within the `canonicalize` function and subsequent comparison of sorted blocks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers both type and location correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the type name and the locations of the blocks when sorting.
2. Update the comparison of blocks to include the locations in addition to the type name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the locations of the blocks in the sorting process and comparison, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.
