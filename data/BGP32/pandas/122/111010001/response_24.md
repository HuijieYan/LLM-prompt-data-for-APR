## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The function checks the equality of two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The error occurs because the function is not comparing the content of blocks correctly, leading to the wrong assertion in the failing test.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to compare the content of the blocks using the `block.values` attribute instead of comparing based on block objects directly.

## Correction:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the data in both BlockManagers before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a function to compare block values
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)
    
    # Compare block values from sorted blocks list
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the values of the blocks within the `BlockManager`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test as it correctly checks for the equality of the blocks' content.
