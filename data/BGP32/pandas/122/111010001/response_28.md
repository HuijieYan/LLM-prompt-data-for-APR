### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality using their axes and blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes fails, resulting in the assertion failure.
4. The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of block ordering during the equality check.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the sorting of blocks by `canonicalize` function which fails to correctly order blocks. This results in incorrect comparison of blocks and two dataframes that are expected to be different, are considered equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function truly reflects the order in which blocks are expected to be compared. Additionally, we should update the equality check based on these sorted blocks.

### Fixed Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize the blocks based on dtype and block_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._block_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After correcting the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison according to the sorted blocks, the fixed version of the `equals` function is more robust and should pass the failing test.
