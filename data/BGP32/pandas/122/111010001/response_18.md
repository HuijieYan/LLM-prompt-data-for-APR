1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is the `equals` function. This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal or not.

2. The bug is likely within the logic of comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by their data type name and manager locations, and then checking if each block is equal between the two `BlockManager` objects.

3. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` fails. The specific error states that `assert True is False` which means that the `equals` comparison incorrectly returned True for the equality check between `df1` and `df2`.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects are performed correctly. One potential issue could be related to the specific data types or values within the blocks that are causing the equality check to fail.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now converts the data type and manager locations to strings for sorting the blocks. This helps in ensuring that the block ordering and comparison are done correctly. Now, the equality check between `df1` and `df2` should pass without any issues.
