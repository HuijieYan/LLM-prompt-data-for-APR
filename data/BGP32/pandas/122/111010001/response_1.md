1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`) based on their axes and blocks. The error message is indicating that the comparison is incorrect when testing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - Comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` length.
   - Comparing the equality of axes using `all` and `zip`.
   - Sorting and comparing blocks of both `self` and `other`.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug is likely caused by comparing the DataFrames directly instead of comparing their columns. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not handle the comparison of pandas DataFrames correctly.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   Modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to compare the actual values within the DataFrames, column-wise, rather than comparing the DataFrames themselves. This can be achieved by iterating over the columns and checking for equality.

5. Corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = {axis: getattr(self, axis) for axis in ["shape", "ndim"]}
    other_axes = {axis: getattr(other, axis) for axis in ["shape", "ndim"]}
    
    if self_axes != other_axes:
        return False

    self_data = {col: self.get(col) for col in self.columns}
    other_data = {col: other.get(col) for col in other.columns}
    
    return all(self_data[col].equals(other_data[col]) for col in self_data)
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function correctly compares the columns of the two DataFrames and ensures that the DataFrames are considered equal only if all their corresponding columns are also equal.
