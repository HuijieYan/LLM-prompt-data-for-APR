1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal based on their blocks and axes. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) using the `.equals()` method returns `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The sorting of blocks based on a custom key `canonicalize()` function.
   - The comparison of blocks using the `equals()` method.

3. The cause of the bug is that the custom sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function might not be working as intended, causing the comparison of blocks in the `equals()` method to fail. This results in the incorrect comparison output leading to the failing test.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a proper tuple for sorting based on block data. Additionally, we can directly compare the block data for equality instead of relying on the internal `_equals` method.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Direct comparison of block data for equality
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and block.dtypes.equals(oblock.dtypes)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their data and then compares the block values and data types directly for equality. The function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
