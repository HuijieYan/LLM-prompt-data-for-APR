1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library.
   - The `equals` method is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
   - The error message indicates that the equality check between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) failed due to a mismatch in values. 

2. **Identified Error**:
   - The error seems to be occurring when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes of the `BlockManager` instances. These blocks hold the data values of the DataFrame.
   - The bug may be related to the way blocks are being compared and sorted.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The error occurs because the `equals` method does not handle the comparison of blocks correctly. It sorts the blocks based on the combination of dtype name and manager locations, but it doesn't account for the different order of the columns in the DataFrames.
   - As a result, when comparing two DataFrames with different order of columns, the comparison fails because the block sorting is not done considering the column order.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances accounts for the order of columns in the DataFrames.
   - One way to address this issue is to sort the blocks by column names instead of dtype name and manager locations.
   - We should ensure that the column order is consistent when comparing the blocks, making the `equals` method behavior align with the requirements of DataFrame equality.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by column names for consistent order
    self_cols = set(self_axes)
    other_cols = set(other_axes)

    self_blocks = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] in self_cols, self.blocks))
    other_blocks = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] in other_cols, other.blocks))

    # Canonicalize block order by column names and then compare
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block[0]

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method now considers the column names when sorting and comparing the blocks, ensuring that the comparison between two DataFrames handles the column order correctly.
