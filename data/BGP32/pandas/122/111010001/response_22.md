The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class of `managers.py` is attempting to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The issue arises from the comparison being executed incorrectly due to the different data types in the columns of the two DataFrames. 

### Steps to Correct the Bug:
1. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
2. The incorrect result is due to comparing DataFrames with columns having different data types.
3. The `equals` method in the buggy function is comparing blocks directly, which is problematic when the data types differ.
4. To fix the bug, we should sort the DataFrames by column data type and then compare them.
5. Consider evolving the `canonicalize` function to handle the sorting based on data types.
6. Update the `equals` function to sort the blocks based on this new sorting criteria before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort blocks based on data type and then on manager locations
        return (
            block.dtypes.to_list(),
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the DataFrames will now be sorted based on column data types before comparison. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the comparison is done correctly, passing the failing test.
