**Analysis:**

The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class, which is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function is comparing two instances by first checking if they have the same number of axes, then checking if the axes are equal, consolidating the instances in place, and finally comparing the blocks within the instances.

The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` failed when calling the `equals` method on `df1`.

**Issues:**

1. The implementation of the `equals` function is incorrect. It does not handle the case when the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are different. If the number of blocks is different between the two instances, the function returns `False` without comparing the blocks themselves.

2. The assertion failure message in the test output is misleading. It shows `True is False`, which does not provide clear information about the actual comparison that failed.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug in the `equals` function:
- We need to add a check to compare the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If the lengths are different, we should return `False` immediately.
- Update the assertion message in the test to provide more informative details about the comparison that failed.

**Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:**

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if number of blocks is the same
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where the number of blocks between two instances is different.

After applying this fix, the failing test that compares two `DataFrame` instances using the `equals` method should now pass without any assertion errors.
