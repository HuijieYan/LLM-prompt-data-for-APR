### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` class.
- The function first checks if the number of axes of the two instances are the same, then calls `_consolidate_inplace` method on both instances, and finally compares the blocks in both instances.
- The issue occurs when comparing the blocks. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by their type name and manager locations. 
- The error message suggests that the comparison is rendering a `True` result instead of `False`.
- The issue might be related to the fact that the function `canonicalize` is not implemented correctly or is not providing unique values for each block.

### Solution:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates unique values for each block. 
- One possible approach is to concatenate the block's data and compute a hash of it to serve as a unique identifier during sorting.
- We also need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(tuple(block.get_values().ravel()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a hash of the block's data as a unique identifier in the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that the comparison of blocks is done properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
