1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
   - The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager`. It compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, and then compares the blocks themselves.
   - The error message indicates that the comparison fails unexpectedly, which leads to the assertion error in the test.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The comparison logic inside the `equals` function might be incorrect.
   - The canonicalization of blocks before comparison might not be working as intended.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug is likely caused by an issue in the canonicalization of blocks or the comparison logic. The error message shows that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` failed unexpectedly.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated before comparison.
   - Verify that the canonicalization logic is correctly identifying unique blocks for comparison.
   - Check the equality comparison logic to ensure it properly handles different types of blocks.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_blocks_dtype().name, str(block._all_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes changes to ensure correct consolidation of blocks and proper canonicalization before comparison. These changes should address the bug and make the comparison function work as intended.
