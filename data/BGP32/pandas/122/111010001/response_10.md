### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
   
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) for equality. It first checks if the number of axes is the same and then proceeds to compare the blocks within each `BlockManager`.

3. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but the comparison is returning `True`.

4. The cause of the bug is likely due to the way the blocks are being compared in the function. The `equals` method first consolidates the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects and then sorts and compares the blocks. The issue may arise from the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function or the subsequent comparison of sorted blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can change the comparison logic for sorting and comparing the blocks in the `equals` function. Specifically, we can update the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than just dtype and mgr_locs. This will ensure a more accurate comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on content rather than dtype and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their values converted to strings, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks. This should fix the bug observed in the failing test.
