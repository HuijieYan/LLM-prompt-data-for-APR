### Analysis:
1. **Bug Location**: The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
   
2. **Issue**: The bug occurs when trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances that have different block orders due to unconsolidated blocks (for example, Categorical blocks).
   
3. **Bug Cause**: The bug arises from the inconsistency in block orders during the comparison, which results in incorrect evaluation of equality between the two `BlockManager` instances.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block order is consistent when comparing the two `BlockManager` instances. One approach is to sort the blocks based on a canonical representation that takes into account the block type and location.
   
### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if the number of axes is equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if each axis is equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks is equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a canonicalization function for sorting blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block in sorted order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks using the canonicalization function that considers the type name and locations, we ensure that the block order is consistent during the comparison process, thus fixing the bug.
