1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` function, which aims to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the number of axes, the labels of the axes, the number of blocks, and the content of each block between the two `BlockManager` objects.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - Comparing the content of the blocks without properly checking if the two `BlockManager` objects have the same number of blocks.
   - The use of the `equals` method to compare blocks in a non-direct way, causing the assertion error.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not properly handle the case where the two `BlockManager` objects have a different number of blocks. This results in an assertion error when trying to compare the content of blocks without making sure there is a one-to-one correspondence between them.

4. To fix the bug, we should first check if the number of blocks in both `BlockManager` objects is the same before comparing the content of the blocks. Additionally, instead of using the `equals` method directly to compare blocks, we should implement a custom comparison logic for the blocks.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Custom comparison logic for blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected function, the comparison is done by verifying the number of blocks first and then comparing the blocks individually using a custom comparison logic within the `equals` function. This should fix the issue and make the test pass without any assertion errors.
