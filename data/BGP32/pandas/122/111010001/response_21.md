## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) within the `equals` method.
4. The bug may be caused by the fact that the DataFrame columns are not in the same order and hence their blocks are compared in an incorrect order.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug may be fixed by sorting the DataFrame blocks based on the column names before comparing them.
2. By sorting the blocks based on column names, we ensure that the comparison is done in a consistent order.
3. This would prevent the issue where the columns are in a different order causing the comparison to fail.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on the column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.columns)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` method, the comparison of DataFrames should be consistent and accurate, resolving the bug that caused the failing test.
