### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, when it should be `False`.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function may not be returning the expected tuple for comparing blocks.
2. The comparison criteria for blocks in the `equals` function may not be accurate.
3. The usage of the `equals` method within the `return all(...)` statement may not be functioning as intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is likely in the way the `canonicalize` function is constructing the tuple for block comparison. It may not be properly distinguishing between different blocks.
- Additionally, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method within the `return all(...)` statement may not be correctly identifying differences between blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the `canonicalize` function to ensure it generates unique tuples for blocks based on dtype and `mgr_locs`.
2. Revisit the block comparison logic to make sure the comparison is accurate and captures all differences.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version improves the `canonicalize` function to create unique tuples based on block's dtype and `mgr_locs`. It also revises the logic for comparing blocks using the `equals` method to correctly identify any differences between blocks.
