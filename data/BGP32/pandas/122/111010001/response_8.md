### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class, which compares two instances of `BlockManager` class.
2. The `equals` function checks if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `DataFrame` objects within the `BlockManager` objects in `equals` function. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
4. The issue seems to be with how the `equals` function is comparing the blocks of data within the `BlockManager`.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to compare the values of the blocks directly rather than comparing them using their dtype names and locations.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now return the correct equality comparison results.
