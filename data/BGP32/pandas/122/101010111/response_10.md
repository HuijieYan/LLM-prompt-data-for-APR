### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects containing multiple blocks.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two objects are equal, then proceeds to compare individual blocks.
3. The bug occurs when comparing individual blocks' equality due to the sorting method used based on block properties.
4. The discrepancy arises because the sorting logic doesn't consider the actual values within the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from using a `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting method doesn't guarantee reflection of actual block contents. Thus, the function incorrectly returns `True` for unequal blocks due to this inaccurate comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the sorting criteria considers the actual values within each block for a proper equality comparison. By extending the sorting logic to include a comparison of block contents, we can accurately determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equal or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the `equals` function will properly compare `BlockManager` objects based on the actual block contents, providing accurate equality results.
