### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating the blocks within each `BlockManager`, sorting the blocks by type and location, and comparing them.
   
2. The error message indicates that an assert statement checking if `df1.equals(df2)` is False failed.
   
3. The bug arises from comparing blocks with different locations as equal. Hence, even if the blocks contain the same data, different locations would lead to incorrect equality comparison.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that not only the block data is considered but also the locations to differentiate blocks correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fix the buggy equals method in the BlockManager class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, consider dtype, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    # Sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all corresponding blocks match
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the `BlockPlacement` objects (`mgr_locs`) within the `canonicalize` function and sorting blocks based on both `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, we ensure that blocks are compared based on their data and locations, resolving the issue of wrongly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.

This bug fix should address the GitHub issue where the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
