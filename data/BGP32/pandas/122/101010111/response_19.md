### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two block managers by comparing their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks' locations which are causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.
3. The failing test is checking the equality of two data frames with the same columns but different values, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`, but it is actually returning `True`.
4. The problem arises from the `canonicalize` function where the block's location is being compared, which results in unwanted `True` return when the block's placement differs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their content and structure rather than their location. We can remove the `mgr_locs` comparison from the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue in the failing test and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
