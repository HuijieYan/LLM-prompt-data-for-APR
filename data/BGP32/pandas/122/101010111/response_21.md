### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might not be accurate due to a sorting method based on `canonicalize` function.
2. There might be an issue with the `canonicalize` function itself.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug causes the comparison to consider two DataFrames as equal even when the blocks are in different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the `canonicalize` function to ensure it accurately represents the comparison criteria.
2. Update the sorting method applied to `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to reflect the actual equality checking criteria correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the locations of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        type(b1) == type(b2) and b1._start == b2._start and b1._stop == b2._stop and np.array_equal(b1.values, b2.values)
        for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a more precise and robust `canonicalize` function that considers the type of the block, the start and stop indices, and the values of the blocks for comparison. This adjustment should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
