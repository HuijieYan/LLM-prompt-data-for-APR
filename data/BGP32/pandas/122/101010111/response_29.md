### Analyzing the buggy function and related information

The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This method is responsible for checking the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.

The `equals` method first compares the lengths of the axes of two `BlockManager` objects. If they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it proceeds to compare each block within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison involves sorting the blocks and then checking the equality of each pair of corresponding blocks.

The failing test case is trying to compare two DataFrames that have the same columns but with different data values. The expected result is `False` if the data values are different.

The error message shows that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue could be related to the comparison logic of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects after sorting them based on type and locations.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the comparison in the `equals` method is not taking into consideration the actual data content of the blocks. It is only sorting the blocks based on type and locations, which can cause blocks with different data values to be considered equal.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to include a check for the actual data values within the blocks after sorting them. This way, blocks with different data values will not be mistakenly considered equal.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the actual values within the blocks, we ensure that the comparison considers the data content of the blocks. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test case.
