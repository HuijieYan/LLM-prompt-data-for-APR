### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`) for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are the same.
   
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect comparison of blocks' locations in `canonicalize` function may lead to incorrect sorting of blocks.
   - Lack of appropriate checking for block content equality after sorting the blocks based on type and location.

### Cause of the bug

1. The bug arises from not appropriately comparing the locations of blocks in the `canonicalize` function. Due to this, the blocks might be sorted incorrectly, leading to faulty comparisons.

2. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different data types in columns and expects the `equals` method to return `False`. However, due to the bug in the implementation, the comparison does not correctly consider the actual content of the blocks leading to an incorrect result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should consider the content of the blocks along with their type and location, ensuring that only blocks with the exact same content are considered equal. Additionally, after sorting the blocks using `canonicalize`, there should be a final comparison of block content for equality to ensure correct handling of different block types.

### Corrected Version of the code

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's data values along with the type and location. After sorting the blocks based on this combined criteria, the comparison of blocks is performed using the `equals` method to ensure that only blocks with the exact same content are considered equal. This modification should address the issue and make the `equals` method behave as expected.
