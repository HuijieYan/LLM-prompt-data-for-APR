### Analysis:
#### Buggy Function Overview:
- The buggy function is `equals()` within the `BlockManager` class, which is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The function first compares the axes of the two objects and then proceeds to compare their blocks.
- The issue arises when the block locations (corresponding to unconsolidated blocks) are not considered during the comparison, leading to incorrect results.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Block comparison without consideration for block locations.
2. Sorting the blocks without taking block locations into account.
3. Using `as_array` incorrectly without accessing the actual array.

#### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the fact that the function mistakenly assumes that sorting blocks without considering block locations will lead to accurate comparisons. This assumption overlooks cases where unconsolidated blocks with the same content but different locations could exist.

Furthermore, the comparison of `Self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly without considering the block locations results in false positives when the blocks have different locations but the same content.

The error message indicates that the function incorrectly returns True when it should be False, showcasing the bug's impact on the actual output.

#### Fix Strategy:
To rectify the bug, consider incorporating block locations into the comparison process. By including block locations when sorting and comparing the blocks, the function can accurately determine whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.astuples())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block locations by using `block.mgr_locs.astuples()`. This adjustment ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are properly distinguished during sorting.

By updating the comparison process to include block locations, the function will now produce accurate results and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
