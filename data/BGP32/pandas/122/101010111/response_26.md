### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two block managers for equality.
2. The function first compares the axes of `self` and `other`, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, and finally compares individual blocks for equality.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` but it should return `False`. This suggests that there is a flaw in the equality comparison logic of the function.
4. The expected input/output values for the failing test indicate that the axes, blocks, and block placement locations need to be correctly handled for the function to work as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. Since the sorting of blocks is based on a canonicalization function, any mismatch in the sorting order of blocks can lead to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the `self` and `other` blocks are sorted using the same canonicalization function before comparing them for equality. This will ensure that identical blocks that might have different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the blocks in both `self` and `other` are sorted based on the canonicalization function before comparing them for equality. This should ensure that the function correctly identifies unequal blocks even if they have different locations.
