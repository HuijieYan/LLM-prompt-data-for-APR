The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different order when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs to establish equivalence, but if the blocks are identical, reside in different locations, and are sorted differently, the comparison may yield incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `canonicalize` function so that it considers the block's values when determining equivalence. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Existing functions in the class

    # Corrected version of the buggy equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Modified canonicalize function to consider block values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.shape)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the block values along with their shapes in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected `equals` function now correctly accounts for identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the comparison yields the expected results.
