## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)`, which is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It initiates by comparing the axes of the two BlockManagers, then consolidates them in place with `_consolidate_inplace` function, and finally compares the blocks within the BlockManagers, sorting them by their type and location.
   
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing, asserting that `df1.equals(df2) is False` but the comparison results in `True is False`.

3. The bug seems to originate from the sorting of blocks based on block type (`dtype.name`) and locations (`mgr_locs`). This sorting could lead to incorrect distinctions between blocks if different blocks share the same type and locations. Consequently, the comparison may yield unexpected results.

4. To fix this bug, we need to identify a more robust approach for comparing the blocks within the BlockManagers. Instead of relying solely on the sorted blocks, we can consider incorporating additional attributes for comparison to ensure correct distinctions between blocks with similar type and locations.

## Bug Fix
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for sb, ob in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if sb.dtype != ob.dtype:  # Compare block types
            return False
        
        if sb.mgr_locs != ob.mgr_locs:  # Compare block locations
            return False
        
        if not sb.equals(ob):  # Compare the actual content of blocks
            return False
    
    return True
```

By including additional comparisons for block type and locations, we ensure a more accurate equivalence check between the BlockManagers. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should pass the failing test case provided.
