### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True`. This implies that the buggy function is not correctly comparing the two DataFrame objects.
3. The expected input values and types for the buggy function in the failing test are provided. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the comparison of the blocks based on their dtype names and mgr_locs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for cases where the blocks have the same content but differ in location.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include the block.mgr_locs for better comparison
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks based on dtype names and mgr_locs
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function now includes the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the comparison considers the block locations. This modification should fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug and enable the function to properly compare the two DataFrame objects.
