### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and block contents.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` failed when using the `equals` method, returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of axes and blocks within the `equals` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic properly checks the equality of the axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# The corrected version of equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version ensures proper comparison by sorting and comparing the blocks based on `dtypes` and `mgr_locs`. This fix should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
