### Bug Analysis:
1. The issue arises from the buggy `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. 
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects to check for equality based on axes and blocks.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison logic when checking block equality. It compares blocks' locations instead of their content.
4. The failing test case involves two DataFrames with the same columns but different values, expecting the `equals` function to return `False`, which it should.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare block content rather than their locations for proper equality comparison.
2. Sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the content of the blocks before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Previous function definitions

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return block.values.tostring()
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `equals` function properly compares the content of blocks in `BlockManager` objects for equality. It fixes the bug identified in the issue and should now pass the failing test case.
