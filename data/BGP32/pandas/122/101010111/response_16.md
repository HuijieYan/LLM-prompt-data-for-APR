### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function relies on comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, which can lead to incorrect results due to the unconsolidated blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `True`, suggesting that the function is returning `True` incorrectly in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is accurate and accounts for potential discrepancies due to unconsolidated blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To handle unconsolidated blocks, we need to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them.
2. We can achieve this by calling `_consolidate_inplace()` on both `self` and `other` instances before comparing their blocks.
3. Sorting the blocks based on a canonicalized key that includes the block's type name and locations would help in correctly comparing the blocks.
4. After sorting the blocks, we should compare them using a loop to ensure all blocks are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # Other functions here...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order to handle unconsolidated blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By consolidating the blocks and comparing them after sorting by their type name and locations, the function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test case.
