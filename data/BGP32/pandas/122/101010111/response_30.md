### Fixing the Bug

#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The error message shows that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrame objects with different data.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` in this case.

#### Bug Explanation:
1. The function checks if the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is different, returning `False`. This part seems correct.
2. Then it compares each pair of axes from `self_axes` and `other_axes`, returning `False` if any pair doesn't match. This checks the correctness of the data labels.
3. After that, it consolidates the data blocks in-place for both objects.
4. The bug likely occurs during the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The code sorts the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize`. If any blocks have the same data but different locations (as in the failing test), they will still be considered equal.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The block comparison should take the data itself into account, not just the dtype and locations.
2. We need to change the way blocks are compared to consider the actual values in the blocks.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.values_equal(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function compares the values of the blocks using a new method `values_equal()` instead of simply checking the block type and locations. This change ensures that the actual data values are compared for equality.
