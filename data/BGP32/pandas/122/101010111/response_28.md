### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal in length. Then it compares each axis using the `equals` method.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks where the function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.
5. The function then compares each block in sorted order for equality.

### Error Analysis
1. In the failing test, the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with the error `assert True is False`.
2. The issue lies in the buggy function's logic where it fails to correctly identify that `df1` and `df2` are not equal due to a swap between columns `a` and `b`.
3. The issue is caused because the function does not correctly compare the contents of the corresponding blocks in the `block.equals(oblock)` comparison.
4. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the actual data inside the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to compare the actual block data, not just the type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. We can enhance the sorting mechanism to prioritize actual content comparison over just the block properties.

### Code Fix
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return repr((block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This revised version of the `equals` function focuses on comparing the actual data in the blocks by using `repr((block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))` as the key for sorting. This change should enable a correct comparison and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
