### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method checks whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block content.
2. The error message indicates that the test case `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the equality comparison returned `True` when it was expected to be `False`.
3. The bug arises from the sorting mechanism in the function that uses the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on data types and memory locations. Due to a bug in the sorting logic, identical blocks with different locations may be considered unequal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the sorting mechanism to ensure that blocks with the same data type and content are considered equal, regardless of their memory locations.

### Plan for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to compare block contents instead of memory locations.
2. Modify the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to consider content equality.
3. Ensure that the equality comparison is based on block content to correctly determine equality of `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.T.to_list())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use `block.values.T.to_list()` to get the content of the block, we ensure that blocks with the same data type and content are considered equal. The corrected version should pass the failing test and correctly compare `BlockManager` instances for equality.
