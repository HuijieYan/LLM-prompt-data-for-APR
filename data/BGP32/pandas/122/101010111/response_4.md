### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class, which is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.
2. The buggy function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the individual blocks in a sorted order. 
3. The bug likely stems from the comparison process of blocks after sorting based on the `canonicalize` function. The issue is caused by comparing two blocks that have swapped locations with different data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers not just the contents but also the locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for sorting.
2. Comparing block locations along with block contents during the final equality check.
3. Update the `equals` method to consider the location along with content for each block.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    # Compare both block contents and locations
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes checking the block locations in addition to block content, ensuring that blocks with swapped locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
