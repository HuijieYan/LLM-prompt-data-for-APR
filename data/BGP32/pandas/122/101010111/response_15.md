### Identified issues in the buggy function:
1. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to sort the blocks of `self` and `other`, but the `block` object does not have the attribute `mgr_locs` which leads to an AttributeError.
   
2. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` can potentially fail due to unmatching blocks order if categorical blocks are involved, which may not be a good metric for the overall equality check.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from trying to access non-existent attributes in the `block` object when constructing the tuples for sorting. This causes the function to fail with an AttributeError, leading to incorrect comparisons between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, sorting the blocks based on dtype and manager locations might not always ensure correct equality checking due to potentially unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `block` objects have the necessary attributes accessed in the `canonicalize` function. Additionally, a better approach for comparison may involve checking equality iteratively for each block instead of relying on sorting based on dtype and manager locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check equality for each block
    for block_idx in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[block_idx].equals(other.blocks[block_idx]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

### Changes made in the corrected version:
1. Removed the `canonicalize` function that was causing errors.
2. Updated the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to iteratively check for equality of each block instead of relying on sorting.
3. The corrected function loops through each block and checks for equality one by one, ensuring a more reliable comparison.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly check the equality of `BlockManager` instances without relying on incorrect attribute access or sorting methods.
