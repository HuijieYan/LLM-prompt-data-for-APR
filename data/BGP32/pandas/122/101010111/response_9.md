### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check for equality by comparing their axes and internal blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the buggy function incorrectly returned `True` instead of `False`.
3. The buggy function sorts the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects using `canonicalize` function and then compares each block between the two `BlockManager` objects. The bug may lie in the comparison logic of the blocks.
4. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where blocks have identical content but different locations properly.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account not only the content but also the location of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of blocks along with the content when sorting the blocks for comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider both content and locations of the blocks while checking for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # canonicalize block order, including locations in sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks considering both content and locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the comparison logic, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, passing the failing test and addressing the issue described on GitHub.
