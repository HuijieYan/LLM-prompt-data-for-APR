### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the test case fails because `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`, as expected.
3. The buggy function compares blocks within `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects using `equals` method and constructs canonical block order based on the dtype name and mgr_locs.
4. The bug causes incorrect comparison results due to unconsolidated blocks and varying block locations.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the way blocks are compared within the `equals` function, where unconsolidated blocks can cause incorrect equality results. The comparison logic does not handle different block locations properly, leading to false positives even when blocks are different.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to properly account for block locations and ensure that unconsolidated blocks do not affect the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs` directly without converting to a list and sorting the blocks based on this, the corrected version should address the bug and correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects for equality.
