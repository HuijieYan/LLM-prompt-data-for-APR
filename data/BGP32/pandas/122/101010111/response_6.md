### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic is incorrect, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to properly handle block equality and avoid returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.flat_values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. The fixed function now includes a proper block comparison using the block values and locations.
2. A `canonicalize` function is introduced to correctly compare blocks based on their values and locations.
3. By sorting the blocks before comparison, we ensure that the comparison takes possible unconsolidated blocks into account.
4. The adjusted logic ensures that the function correctly determines equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
