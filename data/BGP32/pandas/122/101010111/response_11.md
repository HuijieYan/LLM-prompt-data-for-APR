### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes, blocks, and blocks' content.
2. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but the comparison is returning `True`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances. The sorting and comparison of blocks may not be handling different locations of identical blocks properly.
4. We need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished during the comparison.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the blocks to account for potential differences caused by block locations. One way to address this issue is to not only compare the block content but also consider the locations of the blocks during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison now includes the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function to account for different block locations. This should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished during comparison. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
