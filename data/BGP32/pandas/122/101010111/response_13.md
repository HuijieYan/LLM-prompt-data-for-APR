### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Related Functions**:
   - The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class.
   - The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
   - It first checks if the lengths of the axes for both instances are equal.
   - Then it checks if each axis is equal by iterating over them with a zip, and if not, returns `False`.
   - It consolidates both instances in place using `_consolidate_inplace` function.
   - It compares the number of blocks in both instances and if they are different, returns `False`.
   - It then sorts the blocks based on a canonical ordering.
   - Finally, it checks if each block in both instances are equal by iterating over them using `zip`.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The issue could be in comparing the order of blocks because the same blocks can be in different orders due to unconsolidated blocks like `Categorical`.
   - The bug might also be related to how blocks are compared in the final `all` statement.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
   - This suggests that the bug is likely in the final comparison of blocks within the `all` statement.
   - The code may not be properly comparing the blocks even after canonicalizing their order.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two instances is done accurately and that the order of the blocks does not affect the result.
   - One strategy could be to compare each block based on its content rather than its ordering.
   - We should also ensure that the comparison between blocks is implemented correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks without considering order
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    # Compare each block in both instances
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a `compare_blocks` function to directly compare the content of each block without considering their order, we can ensure that the comparison is accurate. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
