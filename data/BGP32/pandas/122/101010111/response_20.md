### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the provided test case.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the inconsistent comparison of the `blocks` in the `BlockManager`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the way the `equals` function is handling the comparison of blocks within the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. The function fails to properly sort and compare the blocks based on their properties, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Potential Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects are properly sorted and compared based on their characteristics such as data type and locations. By improving the block comparison logic, the function should correctly identify when two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

### Updated/Copied Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function with improved block comparison logic:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's type and values, the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. This should ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
