### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The buggy function first checks if the lengths of the axes are not equal, then consolidates the internal data structures using `_consolidate_inplace()` method, compares the number of blocks, and finally compares the blocks' content by sorting them based on type and location.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to comparing blocks' content using `equals()` method without considering their location. If the order or location of blocks is different between DataFrames, while the content is the same, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to enhance the block comparison logic to consider both type and location.

### Correction:
```python
# Updated code for the equals function within BlockManager
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sorting blocks based on type and location for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Comparing blocks using type and location
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block.dtype.name != oblock.dtype.name or not block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This updated code ensures that in addition to comparing the content of blocks, we also compare their types and locations before returning the final result. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
