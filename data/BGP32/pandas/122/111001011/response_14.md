### Issue Analysis:
The problem described in the GitHub issue is related to the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The code sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function that combines the type name and the locations of the blocks. However, this method may not be sufficient to detect blocks that are identical but have different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the `equals` function, the blocks are sorted based on a tuple containing the type name and the locations of the blocks to canonicalize the order. This method can fail when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
2. The bug leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, as observed in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, avoid relying on block locations for comparison in the `equals` function. Instead, consider comparing the contents of the blocks directly to check for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype)

    if len(self_blocks_sorted) != len(other_blocks_sorted):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the `canonicalize` function that used block type and locations for sorting.
2. Sorted the blocks based on the block type (`dtype`) to ensure a consistent order.
3. Compared the sorted blocks directly to check for equality.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly compare the blocks for equality without being affected by their locations. This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
