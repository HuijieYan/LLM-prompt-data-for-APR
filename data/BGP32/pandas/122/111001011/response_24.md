### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects, but the comparison logic is incorrect.
2. The function first checks if the length of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects is the same. If not, it returns `False`.
3. Then, it iterates over the axes of the two objects and checks if any axis in one object is equal to the corresponding axis in the other object. If not, it returns `False`.
4. Next, it consolidates the blocks in both objects using the `_consolidate_inplace` function.
5. Finally, it compares the blocks in the two objects. However, the comparison logic is flawed due to the ordering of the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects. Sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs is incorrect because it can result in different blocks with the same dtype being compared, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process for the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects. Instead of sorting the blocks by dtype name and mgr_locs, we should compare the blocks directly without changing their order. This will ensure that identical blocks are compared correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version:
1. We removed the sorting step and directly compare each block in the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. If any pair of blocks is not equal, we return `False`.
3. If all blocks are equal, we return `True`.
