### Bug analysis

The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The method compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The bug occurs when two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks but with different locations, leading to the method incorrectly returning `True`.

1. The buggy function initializes two sets of blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) sorted according to the block type name and locations.
2. It then compares each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks` to determine equality.

### Identified bug location
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function where it sorts blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting doesn't consider the actual block values, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug explanation
In the case where blocks have the same dtype name but different locations, the `canonicalize` function incorrectly considers them equal due to sorting based only on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This oversight leads the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly since the blocks are not actually equal, causing the bug.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function to consider all aspects of the block data when determining equality. This change will ensure that blocks with the same dtype name but different locations are not falsely identified as equal.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize blocks based on block data for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider block values when sorting blocks, the `equals` method will now correctly compare blocks for equality, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
