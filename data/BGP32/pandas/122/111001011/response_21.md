### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises when comparing the blocks in different order due to inconsistencies in the block's ordering. This leads to incorrect results as the function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks in different locations.

The function fetches `self.axes` and `other.axes`, compares their lengths, then iterates over the axes to check if they are equal. After consolidating both instances in place by calling `_consolidate_inplace` method, it compares the number of blocks and then sorts them based on a canonicalize function. The canonicalize function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations to handle unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Location:
The bug is encountered when sorting the blocks inside the `equals` function based on `canonicalize` function. Sorting the blocks in different order based on manager locations can lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks in a calculated order based on the `canonicalize` function. Due to unconsolidated blocks that can only be differentiated by iteration order, the sorting can cause identical blocks in different locations to be compared incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to sort the blocks based on a consistent ordering criteria that doesn't rely on manager locations. A potential solution is to create a simpler sorting approach based on block properties that guarantee consistent ordering and ensure correct comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on type for consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the `dtype.name` property to ensure consistent ordering for comparison. This way, identical blocks in different locations will be correctly identified as unequal, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
