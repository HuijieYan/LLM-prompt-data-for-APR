### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality but fails to detect inconsistency when the blocks in the `BlockManager` have swapped locations.

In the given runtime scenario:
- Both `self` and `other` have the same axes and blocks but with the blocks swapped between them.
- The comparison in the `equals` function fails to detect this inconsistency due to the way it canonicalizes the blocks for comparison.
- This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure that it properly detects differences in block locations. One approach could be to compare blocks based on their content rather than their order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.content: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.content: block for block in other.blocks}

    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False

    for content in self_blocks:
        if not self_blocks[content].equals(other_blocks[content]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version:
- The blocks are first converted to dictionaries with block content as the key.
- The function then compares the keys of both dictionaries to ensure they have the same block types.
- Finally, it iterates over the blocks and compares each block's content for equality.

This correction should properly handle the scenario where blocks have swapped locations, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and returns `False` when blocks are inconsistent.
