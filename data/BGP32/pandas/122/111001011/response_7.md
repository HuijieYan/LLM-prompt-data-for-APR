### Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function involves incorrect comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` objects. It fails to handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations. This issue causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Identification:
1. The function checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, which is correct.
2. Then, it compares each pair of axes using the `equals` method, which seems fine.
3. The `consolidate_inplace` method is called on both `self` and `other`, which could impact the subsequent comparison.
4. The bug arises in the direct comparison of the `blocks` attribute without considering the possibility of blocks having different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
The comparison goes haywire when the function checks if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same number of blocks. It fails to account for blocks potentially having different locations due to operations like `concat`, resulting in equal blocks being considered unequal because of memory location differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Resolve the bug by iterating through the blocks, comparing based on content instead of memory location.
- Use a comparison criterion that avoids issues related to block locations.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def are_blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.dtype.name)
    
    return all(
        are_blocks_equal(block1, block2)
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` instead of memory location, the function can correctly compare the blocks' content, addressing the issue of wrongly returning `True` in cases where blocks are identical but are located differently.
