### Error Identification:
1. The `canonicalize` function may not handle all block types correctly.
2. The comparison of blocks using `equals` may encounter issues due to unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `canonicalize` function does not account for all possible block types, leading to incorrect block comparisons using `equals`. Additionally, unconsolidated blocks could cause discrepancies in the comparison process.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types appropriately.
2. Ensure that comparisons between blocks using `equals` consider any unconsolidated blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes an update to the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type properly and handles unconsolidated blocks in comparisons using `equals`.
