### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check the equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue arises when comparing blocks within the `BlockManager`. The current implementation fails to properly compare identical blocks with different storage locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation between two `BlockManager` objects.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` might not be adequate for accurate block comparison.
2. The comparison of individual blocks using the `equals` method may not handle blocks with identical data but differing locations correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function only considers the type name and manager locations for sorting and comparison. If blocks have the same data but different locations (like in the GitHub issue example), the comparison fails even though the blocks are effectively equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison of blocks should consider the underlying data and not just their types and locations. Improving the block comparison mechanism to handle identical data in different locations is essential for accurate evaluation of `BlockManager` equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Introduce a method to compare blocks based on data and not just type and location
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        return np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version enhances the block comparison by directly comparing the block data values. Using `np.array_equal` ensures a thorough comparison, considering the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
