### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares the axes and blocks of two instances of the `BlockManager` class. If the axes are not equal, it immediately returns False. Then, it proceeds to consolidate the blocks in place using `_consolidate_inplace()` and compares the lengths of the blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks themselves.
   
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks themselves. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` are not considered unique identifiers for blocks that could have identical data but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the use of a non-unique identifier for blocks (`mgr_locs`) when comparing blocks of data, leading to incorrect results when blocks are identical but in different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a more robust comparison of blocks. One way to achieve this is to create a unique hash for each block based on its data content, ensuring that identical blocks will have the same hash regardless of their position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a hash function based on block data
    def block_hash(block):
        return hash(block.values.data.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_hash)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_hash)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

In the corrected version, blocks are sorted based on a unique hash generated from their data content, ensuring a consistent comparison even if they are in different locations. This helps in correctly identifying if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their block data.
