### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the equality of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` due to differing in memory locations (mgr_locs).
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the bug where the function returns `True` even when blocks have different locations.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to consider the actual block contents instead of their memory location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without considering mgr_locs
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that blocks are compared for equality without considering their memory locations, addressing the bug where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as equal.
