### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different locations even though their content is the same, leading to an incorrect return of `True`.
3. The buggy function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, then compares each axis, consolidates the blocks, and finally compares the blocks. The bug is in the last part where location information is not considered.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider their content while ignoring the block locations.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, ignoring block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their content without considering the block locations, ensuring that the comparison is accurate even if the blocks have different locations.
