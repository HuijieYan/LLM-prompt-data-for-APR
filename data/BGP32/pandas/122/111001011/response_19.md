### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is trying to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return True in cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the unexpected behavior of the `equals` function when comparing DataFrames with similar data but different block locations.
4. The bug occurs due to comparing blocks using the `equals` method, which doesn't consider block locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for block locations or use a different approach to comparing the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks accurately, considering their data and locations. One approach could be to create a custom comparison mechanism that looks at the underlying data within the blocks and their specific locations. This way, even if blocks are identical but at different positions, they will be correctly identified as different.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs) and block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, a new `compare_blocks` function is introduced to compare blocks based on both their data values and locations. This ensures that even if two blocks have the same data but different locations, they will be correctly identified as not equal.
