### Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue arises when comparing the blocks stored inside the `BlockManager`. The comparison is currently based on the order of blocks which is incorrect as blocks with the same data but different locations might be considered unequal, leading to the wrong result.

### Potential Error:
The error lies in the comparison of blocks using their order instead of actual content.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function sorts the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a sorting key that considers the block data type name and locations. However, this approach does not consider the actual content of the blocks itself.
2. Therefore, even if the blocks contain the same data, but their locations differ, the equality check will fail due to the reliance on block order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than relying on the order of the blocks. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks and comparing their contents directly, disregarding their order or location.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
        
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block.values for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block.values for block in other.blocks}
    
    if self_blocks_dict.keys() != other_blocks_dict.keys():
        return False
        
    for key in self_blocks_dict:
        if key not in other_blocks_dict or not self_blocks_dict[key].equals(other_blocks_dict[key]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare the blocks based on their content directly, ensuring that blocks with the same data are considered equal even if their locations differ.
