### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two BlockManager instances for equality, specifically checking if the axes, blocks, and block order are the same.
- The bug seems to stem from not properly handling the location of blocks, causing the function to incorrectly return True for cases where blocks are identical but at different locations.
- The issue reported on GitHub confirms the bug when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `equals(self, other)` does not account for the location of blocks, resulting in incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should include a mechanism to compare block locations. One approach is to implement a method that considering the order and content of the blocks to handle cases where blocks are identical but at different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.block_loc.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.array_loc.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function now properly compares the blocks by considering not only their type but also their location (both block and array), ensuring correct equality comparisons even when blocks are identical but at different locations.
