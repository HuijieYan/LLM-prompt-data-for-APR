### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

### Bug Identification:
The bug arises from comparing blocks based on their order and location, rather than their content.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function compares the blocks after sorting them based on the block type and the `mgr_locs` attribute. This sorting operation can change the order of identical blocks, leading to incorrect results. For identical blocks with different locations, this sorting can cause the comparison to fail.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks directly based on their content rather than modifying the order of blocks during comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly based on their content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are compared directly without any sorting based on the block type and locations. This change ensures that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks instead of their order. This should resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
