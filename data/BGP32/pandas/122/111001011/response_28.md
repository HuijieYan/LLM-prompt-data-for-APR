### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes of two objects and their associated blocks. It then sorts the blocks based on the type name and locations, and finally compares the sorted blocks for equality.
   
2. The bug in the function arises due to the use of different axes or blocks order for comparison, leading to incorrect equality results.

3. The bug can be reproduced by passing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but with different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks comparison is consistent, even if the blocks have different locations in memory.
   
2. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to create a unique, consistent representation for each block that ignores the specific memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block content for consistent comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the `block.values` along with the `dtype.name`, we ensure that the comparison of blocks is consistent and does not depend on the specific memory locations. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
