### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug lies in the comparison logic for the `blocks` attribute. The function fails to correctly compare the block details due to the order of the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons even when the blocks are identical but in different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, ensuring they are equal.
2. It then checks if the axes are equal using a check `all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))`. If this check fails, the function returns `False`.
3. The function then consolidates the blocks using `_consolidate_inplace()` for both `self` and `other`, potentially modifying the block positioning.
4. Next, the function compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.
5. The function proceeds to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their content, but this sorting may not accurately represent the internal block structures.
6. Finally, it compares each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. Due to incorrect sorting, identical blocks with different locations could be considered unequal, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and resolve the GitHub issue, ensure that the comparison of blocks considers not just the content but also the locations of the blocks. A suggested strategy is to skip the sorting of blocks and compare the blocks based on their content directly, considering their locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) 
        for (block1, _), (block2, _) in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This updated version directly compares the blocks in `self.blocks` with the corresponding blocks in `other.blocks` based on content, ignoring block ordering and locations. This approach ensures that identical blocks, irrespective of their locations, are correctly considered equal, resolving the bug and addressing the GitHub issue.
