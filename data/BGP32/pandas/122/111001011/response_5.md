### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function is comparing the block contents of two `BlockManager` objects. It first compares the axes and then sorts and compares the blocks. 
2. The bug occurs when the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are identical but have different locations. This leads to an incorrect evaluation and the function wrongly returns `True`.
3. The bug is consistent with the reported GitHub issue where the user expected `equals` to return `False` for `df3.equals(df4)` due to the differing block locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the block contents rather than just the block locations.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function based on the analysis provided above:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the values in the blocks instead of just locations
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        all(block.iloc[:, j].equals(oblock.iloc[:, j]) for j in range(block.shape[1])) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified version ensures that the comparison between blocks is done based on their contents rather than their locations, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.

By updating the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the block contents, this bug should be resolved.
