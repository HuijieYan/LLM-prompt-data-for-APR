### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks, aiming to check if they are equal.
2. The comparison fails accurately detecting equality due to a sorting issue in the blocks before comparison.
3. The bug arises from the misalignment of different blocks while comparing, resulting in the function sometimes incorrectly returning `True` for equal blocks with different locations due to the sorting discrepancy.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on a stable key that ensures consistent ordering regardless of the block's location.
5. The suggested strategy is to sort the blocks based on both the data type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, which represents the physical locations, ensuring consistent ordering for comparison.


### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks defined by the `canonicalize` function, considering both the data type and location, the comparison now ensures a consistent order for the blocks and correctly determines equality.
