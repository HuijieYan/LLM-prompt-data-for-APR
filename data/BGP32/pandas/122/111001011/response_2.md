### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` instances for equality. If the lengths of the `axes` are different or if any pair of corresponding `axes` are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it proceeds to consolidate both instances in place using `_consolidate_inplace` and compares the `blocks` of both instances.
   
2. The bug arises from the way the `blocks` are compared. It tries to sort the blocks based on their `dtype` names and `mgr_locs` using a `canonicalize` function. The sorting might be causing incorrect comparison outcomes, especially when blocks contain the same data but are located differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when comparing the `blocks` of two `BlockManager` instances using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on `dtype` names and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks contain the same data but have different `mgr_locs` due to the unconsolidated blocks, the comparison may wrongly determine them as unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the comparison of `blocks` in a way that still considers the blocks equal even if their locations are different. We can compare the contents of the blocks directly without relying on the sorting based on `dtype` names and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks)))
```

In this corrected version, we are directly comparing the elements of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting them first. This change ensures that the comparison will accurately reflect the equality of the blocks, regardless of their locations.
