### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the bug arises when the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations but contain the same data.

### Bug Identification:
1. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. Next, it compares each axis element between the two `BlockManager` objects using the `equals` method.
3. Then, it consolidates both `BlockManager` objects in place.
4. After consolidation, it compares the lengths of the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.
5. It sorts the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects based on a canonicalized representation, which includes the dtype and block locations.
6. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks and compares each pair for equality.

### Bug Reason:
The bug occurs because the sorting mechanism used in the comparison of blocks (`canonicalize`) relies on the `mgr_locs` attribute, which may not be consistent between two blocks that have the same data but different locations. This inconsistency causes the function to incorrectly determine equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks. Instead of relying on the `mgr_locs` attribute that considers block locations, we should only consider the actual content of the blocks when determining equality.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is removed, and instead, the blocks are sorted based on their values for direct comparison. This change ensures that the blocks are compared solely based on their data content, resolving the issue of incorrect equality determinations.
