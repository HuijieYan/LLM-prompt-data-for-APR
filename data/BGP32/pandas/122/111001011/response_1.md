### Bug analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the same class for equality.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison logic where the order of blocks is not correctly handled.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning `True` when two instances with identical blocks but different locations are compared, while the expected behavior should be `False`.
4. The function attempts to sort and compare blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` attribute, but the comparison logic might fail to distinguish blocks with the same dtype but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that blocks with identical data types but different locations are not considered equal.
2. We should revise the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks to include more information that can differentiate blocks accurately.
3. Updating the sorting mechanism to handle cases where blocks have the same dtype name but distinct locations will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adds the `id(block)` to the tuple in the `canonicalize` function. By including the unique identifier, the function can differentiate between blocks that have the same dtype and `mgr_locs` but differ in location, thus ensuring accurate comparison results.
