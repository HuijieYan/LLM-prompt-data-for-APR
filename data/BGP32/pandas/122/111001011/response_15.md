### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when comparing blocks that have the same data type (dtype) but different memory locations (mgr_locs). The current implementation only considers the dtype but not the mgr_locs, resulting in identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly classified as equal, leading to a faulty comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include the memory locations (mgr_locs) of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function as part of the comparison criteria. By considering both the dtype and mgr_locs, we can accurately compare blocks and address the issue of wrongly returning `True` for blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.mgr_locs` alongside `block.dtype.name` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison accounts for both the data type and memory location of the blocks, correctly identifying blocks with different locations as unequal.
