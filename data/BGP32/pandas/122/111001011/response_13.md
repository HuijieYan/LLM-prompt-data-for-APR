### Bug Analysis:
The bug is present in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises when checking if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal based on their `blocks`. The comparison fails to consider that blocks might have identical content but different locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Error Locations:
1. The function sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function that combines block type name and locations.
2. The comparison using `equals` only checks for block equality without considering block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not account for blocks with identical content but different locations. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation when existing blocks with different locations are compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare blocks considering type and locations. We should ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are treated as different blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` function now uses the block's contents (via `block.get_values().tobytes()`) to differentiate between blocks with the same content but different locations. This ensures that blocks are compared accurately for equality.
