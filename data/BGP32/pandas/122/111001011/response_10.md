### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The function checks if the number of axes is the same between the two objects and then proceeds to compare the axes using the `equals` method.
3. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks. It sorts the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, but the bug is that it doesn't handle the case of identical blocks with different locations properly.
4. The bug causes the function to return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic for blocks in a way that considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.
2. We should compare the actual values in each block while making sure the order of the blocks is consistent.
3. We may need to refactor the `canonicalize` function or introduce new logic to ensure proper block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on actual content
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

In the corrected version:
- We compare the blocks based on their actual content using `to_numpy().tobytes()` to properly distinguish between blocks with identical content but different locations.
- This ensures that the comparison is done on the actual values in the blocks rather than their locations.
- The function now returns `True` only if both the axes and the content of the blocks are equal between the two `BlockManager` objects.
