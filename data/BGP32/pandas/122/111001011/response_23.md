### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The comparison should take into consideration the block locations as well.
3. The bug causes `equals` to return True even if the blocks have the same content but are located differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks without considering their locations, leading to False negatives in determining equality.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information.
2. Modify the comparison of blocks in the final return statement to consider both the block content and their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, considering type names and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks considering content and location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version accounts for both the content and locations of blocks when determining equality, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
