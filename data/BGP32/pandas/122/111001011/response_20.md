### Analyzing the Bug

1. **Issue**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different block locations.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug occurs at the comparison step where it checks if each block in `self.blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`.
   - The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks by type and location (`mgr_locs`) is not correctly handling the comparison.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. Even if the blocks have the same content, if they are placed in different locations within the `BlockManager`, the comparison returns `False`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the content of the blocks for comparison, ignoring their locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now simply returns the `values` attribute of the block, which represents the actual content.
- Sorting blocks based on their content ensures that even if blocks are at different locations within the `BlockManager`, they will be correctly compared based on their data.
- This approach aligns with the expected behavior of comparing the content of the blocks, ignoring their positions.

By applying this correction, the `equals` function should return the expected results for comparisons of `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks.
