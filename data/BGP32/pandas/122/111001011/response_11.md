### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function is intended to compare two BlockManager instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison and sorting of blocks within the BlockManager instances.
3. The bug is causing the function to return True incorrectly even when blocks have different locations.
4. The issue reported in GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior of the function and the expected output.
5. The bug can be fixed by properly canonicalizing and comparing the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique representation for each block based on dtype and mgr_locs.
2. Sort the self and other blocks using the updated `canonicalize` function.
3. Compare the sorted blocks in a pairwise manner to check their equality.
4. Return False if any pair of blocks is not equal, otherwise return True.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using this new logic to sort and compare the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
