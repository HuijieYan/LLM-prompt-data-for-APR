### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares the `axes` of two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates both objects in place, sorts their `blocks` attribute using a custom `canonicalize` function, and finally checks if all corresponding blocks are equal.
3. The bug causes identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly considered equal due to the use of `mgr_locs` during block canonicalization. This behavior violates the expected logic as stated in the GitHub issue.
4. To resolve the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block data itself while ignoring the block's location information.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method to stop using block locations for equality comparison.
2. Directly compare the block data in each block in the sorted order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only compare block values without considering their locations, the corrected version resolves the bug and aligns with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
