### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. **Related Functions**:
   - The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class that contains other functions like `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace`.
   - The `equals` function is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.

2. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - The function takes `self` and `other` instances of `BlockManager`.
   - It compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on certain criteria, and compares each block for equality.

3. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The GitHub issue reports that `DataFrame.equals()` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Identifying the Bug

- The bug occurs when comparing two `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` function.
- The comparison logic doesn't consider the locations of the blocks, causing the function to return `True` even if the blocks have different locations.
- The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`, not considering that the blocks might have different locations but still be equal.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix this issue, the comparison logic needs to consider the block locations while checking for equality. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and block values to differentiate blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tostring())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that blocks are sorted based on their type name and values, considering the block locations as part of the comparison.

By implementing this change, the function will properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
