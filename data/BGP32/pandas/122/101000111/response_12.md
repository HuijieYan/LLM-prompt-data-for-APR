### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub reported that the function `equals` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which contradicts the expected behavior.
3. The bug arises from the sorting logic implemented in the function that can result in different block orderings, causing identical blocks with distinct locations to match incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the sorting criteria to consider the block content as the primary sorting key to ensure correct comparison.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_and_sort(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    self_sorted_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(self.blocks)
    other_sorted_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(other.blocks)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks))
```

By modifying the `canonicalize_and_sort` function to sort blocks based on their values, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly marked as equal.

This corrected version addresses the bug reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
