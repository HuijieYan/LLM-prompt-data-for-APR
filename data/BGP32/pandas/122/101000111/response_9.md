### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class, which compares two `BlockManager` instances.
2. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
3. The bug occurs when identical blocks have different locations, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.
4. The issue described on GitHub confirms that the `equals` method is wrongly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The bug arises because the function does not account for different block locations when comparing blocks for equality.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the block comparison part of the code, where blocks are sorted based on their attributes without considering their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering the block locations when comparing blocks for equality. When identical blocks have different locations, the function incorrectly determines them to be unequal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you need to modify the block comparison logic to account for different block locations. By considering block locations during comparison, the function can accurately determine the equality of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        if block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs  # Considering block locations
    )
```

This corrected version includes an additional comparison for block locations in the `all` function, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled.
