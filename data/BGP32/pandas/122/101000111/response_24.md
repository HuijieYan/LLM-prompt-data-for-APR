### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of pandas. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The potential error locations are the comparison of axes lengths, comparison of axes objects, consolidation of inplace, and comparison of blocks.
3. The bug occurs due to comparing the axes objects `ax1.equals(ax2)` which might yield unexpected results even when the axes are similar. The issue reported in GitHub also confirms that the function wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix this bug, we should first compare the axes names rather than the objects directly and then proceed with the block comparison by considering block type and locations.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(str(ax1) == str(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.data), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the string representation of axes objects, and then sorts and compares the blocks based on data type and locations, addressing the reported bug.
