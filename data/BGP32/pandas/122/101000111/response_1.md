### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug stems from not properly considering the order of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The comparison of blocks is done without taking into account the actual content of the blocks but merely their order.
3. As a result, the function can incorrectly return `True` even if the blocks are the same but placed in different locations within the `BlockManager`.
4. We need to update the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their order.

### Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        pass

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        pass

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype)
        
        self_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
        other_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}
        
        if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
            return False
        
        return all(
            self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]) for key in self_blocks
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function considers the actual content of blocks by creating dictionaries with the content as keys and the blocks as values. It then compares the dictionaries to ensure that both `BlockManager` instances have the same blocks with the same content, regardless of their order.

This approach resolves the issue of returning `True` incorrectly for identical blocks in different locations within the `BlockManager`.
