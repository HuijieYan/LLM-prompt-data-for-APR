### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The buggy function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for canonicalization.
3. The bug occurs as it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The issue posted on GitHub highlights this unexpected behavior and provides a test case where the expected output is `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the sorting mechanism in the function. It sorts blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but different locations of identical blocks can cause incorrect sorting, leading to a false comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, instead of comparing based on `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we should compare only based on `dtype.name` to ensure identical blocks are considered equal regardless of their locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By only considering the `dtype.name` for canonicalization, we ensure that identical blocks are correctly compared. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
