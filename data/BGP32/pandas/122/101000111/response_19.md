### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to arise from incorrect comparison of the blocks' content due to different locations.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the function returns `True` incorrectly for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function, specifically in the block order canonicalization using `canonicalize` function. This function depends on `block.mgr_locs` to compare blocks, which leads to false equality if the block locations are different, even when the blocks themselves are identical.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the block content without considering the block location.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to compare the block content directly by converting the values to bytes. This approach ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
