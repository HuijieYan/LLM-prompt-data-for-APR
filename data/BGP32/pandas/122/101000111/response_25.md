### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue reported on GitHub points out a bug where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
3. The function compares the axes and then sorts and compares the blocks. The bug may be due to the sorting of blocks based on type name and manager locations.
4. To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks directly without sorting to ensure accurate comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, potentially leading to a mismatch when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should directly compare the blocks without sorting them based on type name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
       
        # Compare the blocks directly without sorting
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare the axes and blocks without sorting, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
