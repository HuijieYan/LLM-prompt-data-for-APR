### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class currently compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning True incorrectly in cases where blocks have the same content but different locations.
3. The bug likely arises from the comparison of blocks without considering their positions.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to compare block content accurately, without being affected by block positions.

### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is performing a comparison between two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The bug occurs because the function fails to consider the actual content of the blocks while comparing them. This results in cases where blocks with the same content but different positions are incorrectly identified as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on the current block order, we should compare the block content regardless of their positions. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on their content before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()  # Using the content of the block for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their content by converting the block values to bytes. This way, the comparison becomes agnostic to the positioning of blocks and focuses on their actual content. This approach should fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.
