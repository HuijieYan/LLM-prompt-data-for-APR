### Analysis
1. The buggy function compares the axes of two BlockManager objects and then proceeds to compare their blocks for equality.
2. The bug lies in the comparison of blocks, where the blocks are not properly sorted before comparison based on type name and locations.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing blocks with identical data but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to implement proper sorting of blocks based on type name and locations before comparing them.

### Correction
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the blocks will be sorted correctly before comparison based on type name and locations, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
