Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing blocks with identical content but different location tags, resulting in an erroneous `True` response instead of the expected `False`.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `equals` method of the `block` objects.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `equals` function directly compares the `block` objects without considering their differing locations. For identical blocks with different locations, the comparison results in `True` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison method of the `block` objects to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_block_dict = {}
    for block in self.blocks:
        key = (block.values, block._is_single_block(), type(block))
        if key in self_block_dict:
            self_block_dict[key].append(block)
        else:
            self_block_dict[key] = [block]

    other_block_dict = {}
    for block in other.blocks:
        key = (block.values, block._is_single_block(), type(block))
        if key in other_block_dict:
            other_block_dict[key].append(block)
        else:
            other_block_dict[key] = [block]

    if len(self_block_dict) != len(other_block_dict):
        return False

    for key, blocks in self_block_dict.items():
        if key not in other_block_dict or len(blocks) != len(other_block_dict[key]):
            return False

    return all(
        all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
        for self_blocks, other_blocks in zip(self_block_dict.values(), other_block_dict.values())
    )
```

This corrected version correctly handles blocks with identical content but different locations, ensuring that the comparison results reflect the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
