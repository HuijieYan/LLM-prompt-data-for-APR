### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)`, where it compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. Potential error locations:
   - Incorrect comparison logic for axes and blocks.
   - Sorting of blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
   - Incorrect usage of `mgr_locs` in the sorting function.
3. Cause of the bug:
   - The issue on GitHub reports that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations due to incorrect comparison logic.
   - The buggy function compares axes and blocks without considering the block locations, leading to false positives for equality checks.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the comparison logic to consider block locations.
   - Sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and some other unique criteria to differentiate blocks that may have the same name but different locations.
5. Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by considering the block locations in the comparison and using a more robust sorting key to differentiate blocks appropriately.
