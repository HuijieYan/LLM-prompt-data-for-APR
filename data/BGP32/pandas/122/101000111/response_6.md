### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and locations. The bug seems to occur because the function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks that have identical content but different locations. This leads to a false positive in the equality check.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering block locations.
2. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a canonicalize function that does not differentiate between blocks at different locations.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises when comparing the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering their locations. The blocks are being sorted based on a canonicalize function that only uses the block's data type and locations. If two blocks have the same content but are located differently, the current implementation fails to distinguish between them, leading to incorrect equality check results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to consider both the content and the location of the blocks. By including the block content in the canonicalization process, we can accurately compare blocks with the same content but different locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly marked as unequal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now considers both the data type and the content of the blocks for sorting.
- Sorting is based on the combination of the data type name and the block content, ensuring correct differentiation between blocks with the same content but different locations.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle comparisons of identical blocks with different locations accurately and return the expected results based on the locations and content of the blocks.
