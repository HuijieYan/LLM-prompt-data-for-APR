### Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function takes two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` as input and compares their attributes for equality.
2. The function first compares the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. If not equal, it returns `False`.
3. Then, it checks if the elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
4. It consolidates the data of `self` and `other` using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
5. It then compares the length of the `blocks` attribute in `self` and `other`. If not equal, it returns `False`.
6. Next, it sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` based on a `canonicalize` function that creates a tuple (dtype name, block mgr_locs as array) for each block.
7. Finally, it compares each corresponding block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` for equality. If all comparisons pass, it returns `True` else `False`.

### Bug:
The bug stems from sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function, which uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `as_array` method should not be chained with `tolist()` as it already returns an array. This bug leads to incorrect equality comparison between blocks with identical data but different locations.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple with `as_array` directly without calling `tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
