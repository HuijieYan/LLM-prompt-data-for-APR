### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of block equality may fail if there are unconsolidated blocks.
2. Sorting blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may lead to an incorrect order and failing comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function doesn't handle unconsolidated blocks properly, and the sorting mechanism based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may not always lead to a consistent order, causing the comparison to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers unconsolidated blocks properly and sorting blocks occurs in a consistent manner.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Handle unconsolidated blocks by sorting based on type and location explicitly
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that unconsolidated blocks are handled appropriately during comparison and that the sorting mechanism is consistent.
