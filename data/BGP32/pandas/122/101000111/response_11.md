### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block locations.
2. The issue reported on GitHub states that the function `equals` wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug likely occurs in the comparison of block locations without considering the actual content of the blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare block content rather than just the block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison logic that does not check the content of the blocks but only the locations. This leads to incorrectly returning `True` even when blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to compare the content of the blocks instead of just comparing the block locations. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks and comparing their content using the `equals` method of each block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are comparing the actual content of the blocks by accessing `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function. This way, the function will correctly identify differences in block content, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
