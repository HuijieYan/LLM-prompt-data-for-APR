### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and locations are equal.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function fails to return `False` when comparing two identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which can lead to different block orders making identical blocks with different locations erroneously considered as not equal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on content equality and not their locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their content, not locations.
2. Use the content of blocks to determine equality instead of their locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the function will compare blocks based on their content, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are considered equal, addressing the GitHub issue.
