### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue posted on GitHub highlights that the function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified Errors:
1. During the comparison of blocks in the function, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting operation may lead to incorrect results for blocks that are equal but have different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the sorting operation on blocks using `canonicalize` which is based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might not reflect the true equality of the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, consider a different approach to determine block equality that does not solely rely on these two properties.
2. Revisit the logic of block comparison to have a more robust and accurate method of determining block equality.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly without sorting
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: id(x))

    return all(
        sblock.equals(oblock) for sblock, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- The blocks are directly compared without any sorting based on `dtype.name` or `mgr_locs`.
- Sorting is done based on `id` to ensure consistent ordering but does not affect the equality check process.

This corrected version aims to address the issue highlighted in the GitHub report by improving the block equality comparison logic within the `equals` function.
