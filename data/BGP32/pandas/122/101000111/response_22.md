## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs when the blocks are sorted using a custom function `canonicalize` based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality checks. 
2. The expected behavior is for the function to compare blocks based on actual equality, not just their dtype and locations.
3. The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different content if the blocks have the same dtype and `mgr_locs`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks directly instead of relying on dtype and locations for sorting.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This correction directly compares the content of the blocks instead of relying on sorting based on dtype and `mgr_locs`, ensuring the correct behavior for checking equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
