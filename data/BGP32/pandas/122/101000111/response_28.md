### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method within the `BlockManager` class called `equals`.
2. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, blocks, and block locations.
3. The bug seems to originate from incorrectly consolidating the blocks before comparison, leading to false positives when blocks are identical but in different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are properly sorted with respect to their type and locations before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the blocks not being sorted based on their type and locations before comparison. This leads to situations where identical blocks in different locations are considered equal. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks in both `self` and `other` instances based on their type and locations before comparison.
2. Update the function to incorporate this sorting mechanism to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # other existing functions

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type and locations before comparison, the corrected function addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures accurate comparison of `BlockManager` instances.
