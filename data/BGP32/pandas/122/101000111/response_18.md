### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the length of `self.axes` is different from `other.axes`. If not, it proceeds to check if all axes are equal and then compares the blocks within each `BlockManager`. However, the issue arises when dealing with unconsolidated blocks that have the same content but different locations. This leads to a false positive in equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing blocks based on their location rather than content. When the blocks are sorted with the `canonicalize` function, the sorting is done based on the type and location of the blocks, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. Instead of relying solely on block location, we should compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks to ensure consistent comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the content of each block for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the content of each block within the `equals` function, we ensure that the equality check is based on the actual data rather than the block locations. This corrected version addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and provides accurate equality comparison for `BlockManager` objects.
