### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The bug is due to the comparison of blocks by their order, which can lead to incorrect results when the blocks have the same data but different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their order.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Update the `equals` function to compare blocks based on their content rather than order.
2. Use a more robust comparison method to check for equality between blocks.
3. Consider implementing the comparison based on the content of the blocks present in each `BlockManager` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self.blocks.sort(key=lambda x: hash(x))
    other.blocks.sort(key=lambda x: hash(x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their content before comparing them for equality. This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the provided test case.
