**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on type and location, and finally compares the blocks for equality.
   
2. The bug is related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

3. The bug occurs because the comparison logic ignores the different locations of identical blocks when sorting the blocks, resulting in falsely indicating equality between two `BlockManager` instances with blocks in different locations.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate block locations in addition to block type for proper sorting. This modification will ensure that blocks with the same type but different locations are not considered equal.

5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By incorporating the locations of blocks into the sorting key, the corrected function should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality, taking into account the locations of identical blocks.
