## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug lies in the comparison logic of the blocks. It incorrectly considers two identical blocks with different locations as not equal.
3. The bug is causing the function to return `False` even when the blocks are identical, leading to incorrect output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on their actual content rather than their location.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data along with dtype and mgr_locs.
2. Compare blocks based on their content in the `equals` function, instead of sorting them based on location.
3. Update the logic to compare all blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

## Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize_block)

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared based on their actual content rather than their location, resolving the issue identified on GitHub.
