### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block locations.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method returns True incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
3. The bug arises from not considering the block locations when comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include the block locations.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block's type name and its manager locations.
2. Update the comparison logic to use the modified `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks' characteristics, including locations.
3. Ensure that the modified `equals` function correctly handles cases where identical blocks have different locations.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's type name and manager locations and updating the comparison logic to use this modified function, the bug related to comparing identical blocks with different locations should be resolved.
