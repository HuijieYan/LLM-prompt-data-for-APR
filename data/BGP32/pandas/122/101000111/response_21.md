### Analysis:
1. The issue arises in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class when checking for equality between `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
2. The issue is related to comparing blocks and their order, especially if they have different locations but are identical in content.
3. The function first checks for the equality of axes, then consolidates both BlockManagers, sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, and finally compares the blocks.
4. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the block comparison logic to consider block equality irrespective of their locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to only consider `dtype.name` for sorting blocks.
2. Modify the comparison check to compare blocks based on content only, not their locations.
3. Ensure that the function returns True only if all corresponding blocks in `self` and `other` are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by dtype.name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version resolves the issue by sorting blocks based on `dtype.name` only and comparing blocks for equality without considering their locations. This ensures that identical blocks, even with different locations, will be correctly determined as equal.
