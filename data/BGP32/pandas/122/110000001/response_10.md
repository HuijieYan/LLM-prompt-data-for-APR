The potential error location in the buggy function `equals` is in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison is done based on the `equals` method of the `Block` objects, but the `equals` method is not explicitly defined for the `Block` class.

To fix this bug, we can define an `equals` method for the `Block` class that compares the contents of the blocks. Since the `Block` class is not directly visible in the provided code snippet, I will provide a generic implementation assuming a `Block` class that has a `data` attribute.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function with a generic `Block` class implementation including an `equals` method:

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def equals(self, other):
        return all(self.data == other.data)

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version defines a generic `Block` class with a simple `equals` method that compares the `data` attribute of two blocks. This way, the `equals` function of `BlockManager` can now compare the blocks successfully.
