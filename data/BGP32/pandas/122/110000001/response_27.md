Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Comparison of axes length between self and other without considering the possibility of empty axes.
2. The use of self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() without checking for the existence of blocks in self and other.
3. Sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function without handling potential errors due to unconsolidated blocks.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from not handling edge cases where self or other may have empty axes or blocks. Additionally, the function does not consider unconsolidated blocks during the sorting process, which can lead to incorrect comparisons.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check for empty axes in self and other before comparing their lengths.
2. Verify the existence of blocks in self and other before calling self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace().
3. Handle unconsolidated blocks appropriately during the sorting process.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
