- Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the Pandas library. This function is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

- Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axes length may result in an error if the axes are not properly initialized.
2. The comparison of axes using the `equals()` method may raise an error if the method is not defined correctly for the axes objects.
3. The sorting and comparison of blocks based on their dtype and locations may lead to incorrect comparisons if the logic is flawed.

- Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals()` function arises from potential errors in comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. If the axes are not properly initialized or the comparison logic for axes and blocks is incorrect, the function may return incorrect results.

- Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the axes are properly initialized and compared.
2. Verify that the `equals()` method is correctly implemented for the axes objects.
3. Check the sorting and comparison logic for blocks based on dtype and locations to ensure correct comparisons.

- Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I made sure to properly compare the axes, consolidate the blocks inplace, and use the correct attributes for the block comparison. Additionally, I modified the `canonicalize` function to utilize block values and slice locations for sorting the blocks.
