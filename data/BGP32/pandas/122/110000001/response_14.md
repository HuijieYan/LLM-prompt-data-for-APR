The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. If the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not equal, the function will return False immediately, without proper comparison.
2. The function calls `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` without checking if they are applicable.
3. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might lead to incorrect comparison if the blocks are not in the same order.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` function might be due to improper comparisons and sorting of blocks. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we compare the blocks correctly and handle any potential consolidation issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Check if the data needs consolidation
    if not self._is_consolidated() or not other._is_consolidated():
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self._try_coerce_and_cast_results(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = self._try_coerce_and_cast_results(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the axes are properly compared, both data structures are consolidated, and the blocks are compared correctly without sorting. The function now returns True only if all conditions are met for equality.
