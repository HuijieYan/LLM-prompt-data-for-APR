The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The bug is caused by the fact that the `canonicalize` function does not handle the comparison of blocks correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the comparison of blocks properly. Specifically, we need to convert the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to a tuple before sorting. This will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we converted the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to a tuple before sorting it in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly.
