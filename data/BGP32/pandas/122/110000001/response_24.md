### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` module of the `pandas` library.
2. The function compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
3. The potential error locations in the function could be the comparison of axes and blocks, as well as the sorting and comparison of blocks.
4. The bug could be caused by inconsistency between the axes or blocks of the two BlockManager objects.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if both `self.axes` and `other.axes` are valid and of the same length before comparing them.
2. Check if both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are valid and of the same length before sorting and comparing them.
3. Ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are done accurately.
4. Implement proper error handling in case of any inconsistencies between the BlockManager objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that the `other` object is indeed an instance of `BlockManager` before proceeding with the comparison. We have also retained the comparisons of axes and blocks along with the sorting and comparison of blocks to accurately determine the equality between two BlockManager objects.
