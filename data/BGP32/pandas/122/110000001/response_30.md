### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality.
3. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances for equality.
4. The bug might be related to the comparison logic for blocks.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is at the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method. The `equals` method is used to compare blocks for equality. However, the bug occurs when comparing blocks that have not been consolidated, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both instances of `BlockManager` have consolidated blocks before comparing them for equality. This can be achieved by calling the `_consolidate_inplace()` method on both instances before comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added calls to `_consolidate_inplace()` for both instances of `BlockManager` before comparing the blocks. This ensures that the blocks are consolidated before the comparison, fixing the bug related to unconsolidated blocks.
