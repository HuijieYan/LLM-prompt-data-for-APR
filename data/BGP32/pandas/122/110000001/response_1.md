The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This function is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within this function could be:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without explicitly checking each axis for equality.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which may not be unique identifiers for blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle unconsolidated blocks properly. The block order may vary between two `BlockManager` objects, leading to incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider more unique identifiers for blocks. We can also compare each axis individually to ensure they are equal in length and content.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.shape, block.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare both the length and content of axes between the two `BlockManager` objects. We also include `dtype`, `shape`, and `values` as identifiers for comparing blocks, ensuring a more accurate equality check.
