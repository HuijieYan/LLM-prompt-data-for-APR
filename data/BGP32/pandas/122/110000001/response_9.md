The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The function first checks if the number of axes in both instances is the same, then it compares each axis using the `equals` method, and finally it compares the blocks within each instance.

The bug in the function lies in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks of both instances based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, then compares each pair of blocks. However, the `equals` method used for comparing blocks may not be implemented correctly within the `Block` class.

To fix this bug, we can first ensure that the `equals` method in the `Block` class has a correct implementation. If not, we need to update the `equals` method within the `Block` class to compare the block data properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):  # Added a check for direct comparison of blocks count
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare the block count between the two instances before comparing each pair of blocks. This ensures that we check for equality only if both instances have the same number of blocks.
