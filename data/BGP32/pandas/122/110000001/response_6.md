### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is meant to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function compares the axes of both objects, consolidates the blocks in both objects, and then compares the blocks to determine if the objects are equal.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axes might fail if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not the same.
2. The consolidation of blocks (`self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`) might be incorrect or missing.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks might fail if the blocks are not properly sorted.

### Bug Explanation:
The potential bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the blocks after sorting them based on their type name and locations. If the blocks are not consolidated properly or if the block order is not consistent between the two `BlockManager` objects, the comparison may produce incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that both `BlockManager` objects have their blocks consolidated before comparison.
2. Sort the blocks based on a consistent criterion to ensure proper comparison.
3. Check for consistency in block order between the two objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are consolidated before comparison, and they are sorted based on a consistent criterion (`canonicalize` function) to ensure proper comparison. This should address the potential bug in the original `equals` function.
