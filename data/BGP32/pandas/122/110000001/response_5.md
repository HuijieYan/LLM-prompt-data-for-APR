Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `equals` is comparing the number of blocks in `self` and `other` without checking if `self` and `other` have the same number of blocks. This could lead to incorrect results if the blocks are not aligned properly.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not result in the correct order if the blocks are not consolidated properly before comparison.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the number of blocks without ensuring that the blocks are aligned correctly. Additionally, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not produce the desired order if the blocks are not consolidated properly.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Before comparing the number of blocks, ensure that both `self` and `other` block managers have the same number of blocks by consolidating them.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly identify and sort the blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._combine_type_code, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
