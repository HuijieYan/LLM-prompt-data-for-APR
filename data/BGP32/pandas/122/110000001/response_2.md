1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The potential error locations within the function are:
   - Comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances without checking for `None` values.
   - Trying to access `mgr_locs` attribute of a block within the `canonicalize` function without handling potential `None` values.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where `self_axes` or `other_axes` contain `None` values, leading to potential attribute errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add checks to handle `None` values in `self_axes`, `other_axes`, and within the `canonicalize` function when accessing attributes.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if self_axes is None or other_axes is None or len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if self.blocks is None or other.blocks is None or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name if block is not None else None,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() if block is not None and block.mgr_locs is not None else None
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(filter(None, self.blocks), key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(filter(None, other.blocks), key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added checks for `None` values in `self_axes`, `other_axes`, and blocks within the `equals` function. Additionally, within the `canonicalize` function, we also handle `None` values when accessing attributes to prevent potential errors.
