Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking their contents.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from potentially comparing different types of blocks in `self` and `other`. The function does not account for the scenario where the blocks may contain different types of data in different orders, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that we are checking for equality based on the contents of the blocks rather than just the length or order. We can modify the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of their sorting order.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False
    
    return all(
        self_blocks[mgr_locs].equals(other_blocks[mgr_locs]) for mgr_locs in self_blocks.keys()
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal and then compare each axis individually. We then consolidate both `self` and `other`, create dictionaries for the blocks with `mgr_locs` as keys, and compare the content of the blocks based on their `mgr_locs`. This ensures a proper comparison of the blocks' contents for equality.
