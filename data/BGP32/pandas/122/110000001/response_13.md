### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in pandas. This function is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

### Potential Errors:
1. The comparison of axes might lead to a bug if the axes are not in the same order.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function might not produce the correct order.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function lies in the comparison of blocks after sorting. If the blocks are not consolidated or if there are unconsolidated blocks like `Categorical`, the comparison based on sorting may fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Before comparing the blocks, both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances should be consolidated in place to ensure accurate comparison.
2. Instead of sorting the blocks, a better approach would be to iterate over the blocks and compare them individually.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version:
- Both instances are consolidated before comparison.
- The blocks are not sorted, but compared directly within `all` function iterating over them.

This should fix the bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class.
