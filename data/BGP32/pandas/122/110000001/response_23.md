### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their attributes.
3. The potential errors in the function are:
   - The function assumes that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes exist and that they are iterable.
   - There may be issues with the `block.equals(oblock)` comparison if the implementation of the `equals` method in the Block class is incorrect.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are valid attributes.
   - Verify the implementation of the `equals` method in the Block class to ensure correct comparison.
   - If needed, update the comparison logic in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if not hasattr(self, 'blocks') or not hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- Added checks to verify if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes exist before trying to access them.
- Added a check to verify if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` are equal before comparing them.
- Ensured that the length of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal before performing the comparison.
