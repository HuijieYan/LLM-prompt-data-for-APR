The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. 

The bug in the function lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.dtype.name` is being compared with `oblock.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is being compared with `oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. 

The bug arises because the `block` and `oblock` objects being compared are instances of `Block` class and the `Block` class does not have a `dtype` attribute or a `mgr_locs` attribute. Therefore, the comparison of attributes that do not exist on the `Block` class will raise an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the `Block` objects based on their relevant attributes. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now compares the block values (`block.values`) for creating a unique identifier for each block for comparison. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual block data rather than incorrect attributes.
