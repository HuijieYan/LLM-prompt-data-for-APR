Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The function is comparing the axes of two BlockManager objects without checking if the axes are equal.
2. The function is trying to sort the blocks of self and other BlockManager objects using the "canonicalize" function, which may not work as intended.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison of axes without checking if they are equal. Additionally, sorting the blocks using the "canonicalize" function may not produce the desired result if the blocks are not consolidated properly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to compare the axes of self and other BlockManager objects to ensure they are equal.
2. Ensure that the blocks of both BlockManager objects are consolidated before sorting and comparing them.

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We have added a check to compare the axes of self and other BlockManager objects and ensured that they are equal.
- Both blocks of self and other BlockManager objects are consolidated before sorting and comparing them.
