The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The buggy function compares the attributes of the two `BlockManager` objects, such as `axes` and `blocks`, to determine their equality. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` without checking for the existence of `other.axes`.
2. Calling `_consolidate_inplace` method on `self` and `other` without checking if the method exists in the class.
3. Sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists based on the `canonicalize` function without verifying if the function is implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle cases where `other` can be `None` or does not have the required attributes/methods that are accessed in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if `other` is `None` and return `False` if it is.
2. Check if the `other` object has the required attributes/methods before accessing them.
3. Handle cases where the `canonicalize` function may raise an error due to invalid attribute access.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if other is None or not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(hasattr(ax1, 'equals') and ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if hasattr(self, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
    if hasattr(other, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        hasattr(block, 'equals') and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes checks for `None` object and existence of required attributes/methods before accessing them, ensuring that the function handles potential errors and operates correctly.
