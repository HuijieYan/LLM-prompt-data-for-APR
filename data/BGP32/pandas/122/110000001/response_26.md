### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if they have equal axes, consolidated blocks, and equal individual blocks. 
3. The potential error locations could be:
   - Comparing axes: if the axes are not equal, it should return False.
   - Sorting blocks: canonicalizing blocks is important for comparison but might have errors.
   - Comparing individual blocks: the equality check for individual blocks can be faulty.
4. The bug may arise from incorrect sorting of blocks or comparing non-equivalent blocks due to the way blocks are canonicalized.
5. To fix the bug:
   - Ensure that axes comparison is accurate.
   - Double-check the canonicalization method for sorting blocks.
   - Verify the equality check for individual blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

#### Changes Made:
- Added a check for the length of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before the final comparison.
- Corrected the canonicalization method to use the type name of the block.
