The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of the class based on their axes and blocks. The bug in the function lies in the comparison of the blocks themselves.

The issue is due to the usage of the `equals` method to compare the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The `equals` method for blocks is not properly implemented or defined in the `Block` class, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, you can update the `canonicalize` function to use a more appropriate method for block comparison, such as checking the equality of block values directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we are directly comparing the block values using the `equals` method of the block's `values` attribute. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly at the block level.
