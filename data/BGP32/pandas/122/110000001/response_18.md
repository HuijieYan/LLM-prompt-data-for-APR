### Analysis:
- The buggy function is a method `equals` defined within the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The bug seems to occur in the comparison logic of the blocks.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic of the blocks might be incorrect.
2. The sorting logic of the blocks based on `canonicalize` function could be problematic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function might occur due to incorrect comparison or sorting of the blocks. If the `equals` method is not accurately comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, it could lead to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic properly compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function should correctly order the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.values()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.values()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I modified the sorting logic of the blocks by sorting based on `block.dtypes` and `block.index`, assuming these attributes can uniquely identify blocks for comparison. I also made sure to retrieve blocks using `self.blocks.values()` and `other.blocks.values()` to iterate over actual blocks for comparison.

This should address the potential bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
