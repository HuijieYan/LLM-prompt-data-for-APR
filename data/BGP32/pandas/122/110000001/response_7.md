- Issue: The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class but is missing the definition of the `axes` and `blocks` attributes and methods like `_consolidate_inplace()` which are necessary for the comparison.

- Fix: To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `BlockManager` class has the necessary attributes and methods defined for comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
            return False
        
        if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the necessary attributes and methods are properly used for comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.
