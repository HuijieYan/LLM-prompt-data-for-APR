The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is trying to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug in the function lies in the way it compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute in a way that may cause an error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly access the `mgr_locs` attribute. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed properly in the `canonicalize` function while sorting the blocks. This should address the bug and correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
