Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Comparison of axis lengths without handling the case where one of the axes is None.
2. Sorting of blocks might not handle unconsolidated blocks properly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where one of the axes is None, leading to a potential error when comparing axis lengths. Additionally, the sorting of blocks might not handle unconsolidated blocks properly, causing incorrect comparison results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the case where one of the axes is None before comparing lengths.
2. Modify the sorting of blocks to properly handle unconsolidated blocks.

Corrected version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if (self_axes is None and other_axes is not None) or (self_axes is not None and other_axes is None):
        return False
    if self_axes is not None and other_axes is not None:
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
