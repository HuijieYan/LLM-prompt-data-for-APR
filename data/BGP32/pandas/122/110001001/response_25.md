### Analysis
The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function compares the axes of the two instances, consolidates them in-place, then checks if the number of blocks in each instance is the same before comparing each block for equality based on their type and manager locations. 

### Issues
1. The variables `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using a `canonicalize` function that generates a tuple based on the block's type name and manager locations. However, the `block` object is used instead of its attributes to create the tuple in the `canonicalize` function, potentially causing errors.
2. The comparison of the `block` and `oblock` for equality is based on the `equals` method which should handle the comparison but might not be correctly implemented or called.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use the attributes of the `block` object to create the tuple in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Ensure that the `equals` method for the `Block` class correctly handles the comparison logic.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `block` attributes are correctly accessed when creating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function.
- The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using the corrected `canonicalize` function.
- The `equals` method is assumed to be correctly implemented in the `Block` class for comparing blocks.
