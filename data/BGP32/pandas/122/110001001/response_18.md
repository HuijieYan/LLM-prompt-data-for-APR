Potential Errors:
1. The function is comparing the axes of `self` and `other` but not considering the axes of their blocks.
2. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function might not be handling all cases correctly.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not accurately comparing the axes and blocks of `self` and `other`.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison of axes to include the axes of blocks.
2. Improve the sorting mechanism for blocks to ensure correct comparison.

## Corrected Version of the equals function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes + [block.axes for block in self.blocks]
    other_axes = other.axes + [block.axes for block in other.blocks]
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function compares both the axes and blocks of `self` and `other`, ensuring a more comprehensive equality check. Additionally, the sorting mechanism for blocks has been updated to handle all cases correctly.
