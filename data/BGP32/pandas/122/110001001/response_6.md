The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function where `block.dtype.name` is used to get the dtype name. In the provided runtime values, `block.dtype` is of type `dtype` which does not have a direct attribute `name`. This causes an AttributeError and leads to the failure of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the name of the dtype. We can use `str(block.dtype)` to get the name of the dtype as a string representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should handle the dtype name extraction correctly and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
