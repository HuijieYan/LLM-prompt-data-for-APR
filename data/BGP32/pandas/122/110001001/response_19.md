### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The sorting of blocks based on `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` for canonicalization is causing the bug.

The `block.dtype.name` is extracting the dtype name of the block, but the `block` object is an instance of `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock`, not just a `dtype` object. Similarly, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is incorrect as `mgr_locs` is an internal attribute of the block class and it doesn't have an `as_array` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the canonicalize function to extract the block type and some identifiable information from the block itself.
2. Use this updated canonicalize function to sort the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block type and identifiable information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)  # Update based on block properties

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` function now extracts the block type by `type(block).__name__` and any relevant information to distinguish between blocks. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared correctly while considering their types and properties, fixing the bug.
