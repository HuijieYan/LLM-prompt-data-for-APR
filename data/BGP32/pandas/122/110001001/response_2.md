### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. However, the bug occurs due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function which relies on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different, not directly comparable types, ultimately leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual values instead of internal representations that might differ between block types. One possible strategy is to explicitly check the block types before comparing them for equality. 

### Bug-fixed code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare block contents instead of internal attributes
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the comparison logic to directly compare the blocks for equality without relying on internal attributes that might vary, we can ensure a more accurate comparison between the two BlockManagers.
