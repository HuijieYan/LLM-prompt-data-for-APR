### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The comparison is based on the order of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, which is being sorted using a custom `canonicalize` function. However, the `canonicalize` function is not properly handling the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons and potentially returning False even when the blocks are equal.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the blocks. We can achieve this by updating the `canonicalize` function as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (type(block).__name__, block.values)
```

With this change, we are comparing the blocks based on their type name and values, which should accurately represent the contents of the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version should now accurately compare the blocks within `self` and `other` for equality.
