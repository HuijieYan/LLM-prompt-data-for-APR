### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the blocks of two BlockManager instances. The function checks if the lengths of the axes and blocks are equal between the two instances. Then, it sorts the blocks based on the block type name and location, and checks if each block in one BlockManager is equal to the corresponding block in the other.

The bug occurs because when trying to canonicalize the blocks by sorting them, it fails to correctly compare the block and datatype information. This leads to a wrong comparison result and hence incorrect equality assessment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to consider all the relevant information about the blocks that should be used for comparison. Specifically, we should take into account the type of block, the data it contains, and any other relevant factors that define its uniqueness.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Consider block values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we modified the `canonicalize` function to consider the `values` of the blocks along with `mgr_locs` when sorting and comparing the blocks. This should ensure a more accurate comparison between the blocks and fix the bug in the `equals` function.
