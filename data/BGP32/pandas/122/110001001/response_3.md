The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function fails to return the correct result due to potential issues in the comparison logic.

1. The function first compares the number of axes in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances. If the lengths of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
2. Then, it iterates over the axes of both instances and checks if each axis is equal using the `equals` method. If any axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. Next, the function consolidates both `self` and `other` instances in place.
4. After consolidation, it compares the number of blocks in both instances. If the number of blocks is not equal, it returns `False`.
5. The function then sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function that combines the block data type name and the managerial locations.
6. Finally, it compares each block from `self` with the corresponding block from `other`. If any blocks are not equal, it returns `False`.

Based on the provided input values and the type of variables at the function's return, the function might fail to correctly compare the blocks due to incorrect comparisons or sorting logic.

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure the following:
- Proper comparison of axis labels using the `equals` method.
- Correct consolidation of `self` and `other` instances before comparing the number of blocks.
- Appropriate sorting of blocks for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we ensure proper consolidation of both `self` and `other` instances before comparing the number of blocks. Additionally, we sort the blocks based on the data type name and managerial locations to allow for a correct comparison of blocks.
