The bug in the provided `equals` function is likely due to how the blocks are compared for equality. The function compares the blocks from `self` and `other` by sorting them based on type name and mgr_locs (block indices) and then checking if each corresponding block is equal. 

However, the issue arises from the comparison of block indices (`mgr_locs`). The `canonicalize` function is intended to convert the `mgr_locs` into a list using `as_array.tolist()`, but it seems it's not correctly converting the indices for comparison. This can lead to incorrect block equality checks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list is done correctly inside the `canonicalize` function. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list within the `canonicalize` function, the function should now properly compare the blocks for equality based on both type name and index locations.
