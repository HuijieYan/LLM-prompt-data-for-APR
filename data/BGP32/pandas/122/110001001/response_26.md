### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function is attempting to canonicalize the blocks by sorting them based on their dtype and manager locations (`mgr_locs`). However, there is a mistake in the comparison logic, where it is trying to access `mgr_locs` directly from the block. This leads to an AttributeError since `mgr_locs` is not a direct attribute of the block.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to access the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly from the block. A strategy to fix the bug would involve updating the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the manager locations before comparison. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to correctly return a tuple of the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that the comparison of blocks is done based on the manager locations as intended.
