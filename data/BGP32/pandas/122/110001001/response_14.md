## Bug Fix

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks for comparison. The `canonicalize` function is intended to create a tuple combining the type name and manager locations of the block. However, the `as_array.tolist()` method is incorrectly used to extract manager locations, resulting in incorrect comparison and ultimately causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract the manager locations from the block in the `canonicalize` function to ensure accurate comparisons between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the equals Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Fixing the canonicalize function to correctly extract mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `block.mgr_locs.to_slice()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we ensure that the manager locations are correctly extracted and compared, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
