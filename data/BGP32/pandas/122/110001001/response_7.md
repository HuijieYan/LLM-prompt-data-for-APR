## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other`. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks by type name and `mgr_locs`, which represent the locations of the blocks. However, the bug occurs because `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly and does not provide the expected result for comparison.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the `mgr_locs` from the block. This can be achieved by changing `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to `block.mgr_locs`. This correction ensures that the block locations are correctly used for comparison between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `equals` function will now properly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances and return the correct outcome.
