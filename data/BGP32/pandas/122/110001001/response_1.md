The bug occurs in the equals function of the BlockManager class. The issue lies in the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager instances. The bug arises due to the inconsistent block order when comparing the blocks of self and other BlockManagers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent order before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to canonicalize the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort blocks in a consistent order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison, ensuring that the block order does not affect the equality check. This fix addresses the bug and ensures that the equals function works as expected.
