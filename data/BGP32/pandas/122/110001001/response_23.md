The bug in the provided `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. The function should compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances first before proceeding to compare the blocks.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the function to prioritize comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version first checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` instances are equal before proceeding to compare the blocks. This ensures that the function behaves as expected and returns the correct result based on the comparison of axes and blocks.
