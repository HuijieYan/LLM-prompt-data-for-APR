### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the comparison and sorting of blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. In the `canonicalize` function, the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` call might not return a tuple that can be directly compared between blocks, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to generate a more comparable and consistent representation of blocks. We can achieve this by converting `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple within the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` result is converted into a tuple before comparison. Additionally, we include a check to compare the lengths and equality of axes at the beginning of the function for a more comprehensive validation.
