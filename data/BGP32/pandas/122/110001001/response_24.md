### Buggy Function Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks in the instances.

### Bug Identification
1. The function checks the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, but the debug output shows the block instances being included in tuples, which doesn't seem correct.
2. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type and `mgr_locs`, but the structure of the output values might be incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
- When comparing the block instances, if the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuple structures of block instances, the length comparison method in the code would always fail.
- The `canonicalize` function's return structure may not match the actual block structure, causing issues in the sorting and comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are correctly structured for comparison, possibly by accessing block instances directly from the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Validate the return structure of the `canonicalize` function to match the expected block instance properties for successful sorting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks.values())
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks.values())
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function directly accesses block instances from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` by converting them to lists. It also ensures that the `canonicalize` function returns a compatible structure for sorting the blocks before comparison.
