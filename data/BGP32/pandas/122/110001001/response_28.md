### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function attempts to compare the blocks in `self.blocks` with the blocks in `other.blocks` using the `equals` method. However, in the `canonicalize` function, the `block` variable is incorrectly accessed as if it were a tuple with attributes `dtype` and `mgr_locs`, causing the TypeError.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the `block` variable, which is an instance of a block, not a tuple with attributes. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns the values of the blocks to ensure correct comparison when sorting the blocks. This fix should resolve the TypeError and properly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects.
