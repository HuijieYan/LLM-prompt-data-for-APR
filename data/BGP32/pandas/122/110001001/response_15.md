### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the comparison of `Block` instances within the `blocks` attribute of each `BlockManager`. The current implementation uses a sorting mechanism to compare blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to consider different block orderings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly. We can achieve this by directly comparing blocks based on their content rather than relying on sorting with a custom key function.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting, the corrected function should now properly handle the equality comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances.
