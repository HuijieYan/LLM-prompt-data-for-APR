### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how the `canonicalize` function is defined and how it handles the sorting of blocks. The comparison between blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists is incorrect due to this.

1. The `canonicalize` function is supposed to return a tuple of the block's type name and its `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is incorrectly accessed using `as_array.tolist()` instead of just `as_array`.

2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function is done improperly, leading to incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to return the correct tuple for sorting and ensure the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is based on this tuple.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By returning the correct tuple in the `canonicalize` function and sorting the blocks based on it, comparisons between blocks will be accurate, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
