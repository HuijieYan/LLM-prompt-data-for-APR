### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating the blocks in each object, and then comparing the blocks one by one. However, there is a bug in the function related to the sorting of blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is incorrect, leading to incorrect comparisons and the function returning incorrect results.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```
The issue lies with the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` part, as `mgr_locs` is not an attribute that directly provides a list for comparison.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to properly generate a comparable key for the block. As `mgr_locs` seems to represent block placement, we can create a key based on the type and content of the block for more accurate sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block type and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version updates the `canonicalize` function to use the block's type and values for sorting, ensuring a more accurate comparison between the blocks.
