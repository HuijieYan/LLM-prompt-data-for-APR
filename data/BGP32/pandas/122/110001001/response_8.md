### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances. The bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and locations.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function because `mgr_locs.as_array` does not exist, leading to an AttributeError. This error prevents the function from properly canonicalizing the blocks, causing the comparison to fail even when the `BlockManager` instances are logically equal.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the manager locations of the block. Additionally, we should handle the case where `mgr_locs.as_array` may not exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        locs = getattr(mgr_locs, 'as_array', None)
        return (block.dtype.name, locs.tolist() if locs else None)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function handles cases where `mgr_locs.as_array` may not exist, preventing the AttributeError and successfully comparing the `BlockManager` instances for equality.
