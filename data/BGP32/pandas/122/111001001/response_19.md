The bug in the provided equals function lies in the sorting of blocks before comparison. The function attempts to canonicalize blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs attributes, but the block objects are being directly compared instead of using their equals method. This can lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should utilize the equals method of the blocks for comparison instead of directly comparing the block objects.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By utilizing the equals method of the blocks when comparing them in the final step, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly according to the block contents rather than object references.
