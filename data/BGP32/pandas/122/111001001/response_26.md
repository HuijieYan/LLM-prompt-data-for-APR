### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances is done by comparing their axes, then consolidating the blocks in-place and sorting them to check for equality. However, the bug arises from how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks.

The `canonicalize` function attempts to create a unique representation for each block based on the block's data type name and the manager locations. The bug occurs because a block's manager locations are being converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, but since `as_array` is a method named `as_array` called on `mgr_locs`, it should be `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` instead of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing and sorting the blocks. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` method is correctly called on `mgr_locs` to create a list representation for comparison and sorting.
