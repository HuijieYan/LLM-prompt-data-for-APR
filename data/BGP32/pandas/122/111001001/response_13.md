### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function, the issue arises due to the comparison of blocks between two instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison fails because the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might not match even if their contents are the same. This happens because the blocks are being compared based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, which can be different even if the data inside the blocks is the same.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison method for blocks in a way that compares the actual data inside the blocks rather than their dtype name and mgr_locs. One way to achieve this is by comparing the values within the blocks directly. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True


```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` by iterating over them and using the `equals` method of each block to check if they are equal. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than their dtype name and mgr_locs.
