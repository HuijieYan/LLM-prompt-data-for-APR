### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function tries to compare the blocks by sorting them based on their type name and managerial locations (`mgr_locs`). However, the comparison fails due to incorrect handling of the `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix
The bug seems to be related to how the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed and converted to a list for comparison. We need to extract the actual locations from `mgr_locs` correctly before comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_mgr_locs(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs'):
            return block.mgr_locs.placements
        return None

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, get_mgr_locs(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a `get_mgr_locs` function is introduced to correctly extract the locations from `mgr_locs`. This ensures that the comparison of blocks in `equals` is based on the actual locations of the blocks.
