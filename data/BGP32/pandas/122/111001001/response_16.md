### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by how the blocks are being compared. The function first sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly attempting to access `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is invalid, resulting in a AttributeError and halting the comparison process. Additionally, the dtype extraction from the block is also incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to access the block's manager locations correctly and extract the dtype name from the block. After addressing these issues, we need to compare the blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice(0).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
