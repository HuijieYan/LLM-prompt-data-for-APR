The bug in the provided function `equals` seems to be related to how the blocks are being compared for equality. The bug arises due to the comparison of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `equals` method without properly handling the list of tuples containing block information.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function takes `self` (BlockManager) and `other` (BlockManager) as inputs, then compares their axes, consolidates them in-place, compares the number of blocks they contain, and finally compares the blocks themselves.
   
2. The bug appears when comparing the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by first sorting them using a tuple of block type and manager locations. However, the `canonicalize` function is not extracting the correct information from the block objects, leading to incorrect sorting and subsequent block comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to extract the necessary information in a tuple form that ensures comparison by block type and manager locations.
   
2. Update the comparison step to properly compare the blocks in the sorted lists `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted and compared based on block type and manager locations, resolving the bug in the `equals` function.
