### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison is done by sorting and then comparing the blocks based on their type name and memory locations. However, the comparison process does not handle the case where the memory locations of blocks are different even if the block data is the same. This results in false negatives where blocks that are logically equivalent are considered to be different due to different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and memory locations. One way to achieve this is by comparing the block data directly, ensuring that their content matches instead of relying on their memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_data_equal(block1, block2):
        return (block1.values == block2.values).all()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(block_data_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first check if the axes are equal between `self` and `other`.
2. Next, we consolidate the blocks to ensure accurate comparison.
3. We compare the blocks based on their actual data using the `block_data_equal` function.
4. We sort the blocks based on their type and location for consistency.
5. Finally, we iterate over the sorted blocks and compare their data.

This corrected version addresses the bug by comparing the block content directly, ensuring accurate equality checks between two `BlockManager` instances.
