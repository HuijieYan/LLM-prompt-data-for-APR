The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to the sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function defines the key for sorting as a tuple of `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The issue arises because `block.dtype.name` is not directly accessible as `dtype.name`, and the use of `block.dtype.name` as a key for sorting is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype name from the block. Additionally, we should handle the case where blocks have different types to avoid comparison errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we cast `block.dtype` to a string to include the dtype name in the sorting key. This modification should resolve the bug and ensure that the blocks are correctly compared based on their dtype and location.

Please replace the buggy `equals` function with this corrected version for proper functionality.
