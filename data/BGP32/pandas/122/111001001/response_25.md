### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the line `return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. Here, `block.dtype` is a `dtype` object, and accessing `name` will give the data type name, but `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly. The issue is with `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The `mgr_locs` attribute seems to be a `BlockPlacement` object, not an array, so `.as_array.tolist()` will throw an error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how `mgr_locs` is accessed in the `canonicalize` function. Since `mgr_locs` seems to be a `BlockPlacement` object, we should update the return statement to correctly represent its information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to prevent any errors when comparing the blocks within the `equals` function.
