### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks based on their data type name and the locations of the blocks. However, the `block.dtype.name` is used directly without checking if the block is an instance of the `IntBlock` or `ObjectBlock` class. This can lead to a mismatch when comparing blocks of different data types.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the `canonicalize` function to handle blocks of different data types correctly. We should check the class type of the block and extract the `dtype.name` accordingly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
            return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By checking the type of the block before accessing its `dtype.name`, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly based on the actual data type of the block.
