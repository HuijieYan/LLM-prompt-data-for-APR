The buggy function compares two instances of BlockManager for equality. The bug might arise from the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not return a consistent representation for blocks. It uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which can produce unhashable values. This inconsistency leads to incorrect comparisons and hence the function returns incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a consistent and hashable representation for each block. One possible approach is to use a combination of block properties that ensure uniqueness and stability across different instances.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining relevant block properties
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, `canonicalize` now uses `type(block).__name__` and `block.values` to create a consistent representation. This ensures that the comparison between blocks is accurate and the function returns the correct result.
