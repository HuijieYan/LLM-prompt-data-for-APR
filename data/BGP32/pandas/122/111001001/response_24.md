### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a problem with sorting and comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances due to incorrect sorting based on block type and locations.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing them. One way to address this issue is to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks. We should include the block type and locations in a tuple for proper sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by considering type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `type(block).__name__` to get the block type and `block.mgr_locs.as_array().to_list()` to extract locations. This ensures proper sorting of the blocks for comparison.
