### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to how the blocks are being sorted and compared for equality.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. If not, it returns `False`, indicating a difference in axes between the two `BlockManager` instances.

2. Then it checks if each pair of axes from `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal using the `equals` method. If any pair is not equal, the function returns `False`.

3. Following that, the function consolidates both `BlockManager` instances in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.

4. After consolidation, it compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not the same, it returns `False`.

5. Next, it sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on a canonicalization function `canonicalize`, which combines the block's data type name and manager locations.

6. Finally, it compares each pair of blocks from `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to check if they are equal. If any pair is not equal, it returns `False`.

### Bug Fix:
The issue seems to arise during the sorting of blocks based on canonicalization. The bug could be related to how the sorting key is being generated. One approach to fixing this bug is to adjust the `canonicalize` function to create a stable sorting key that includes all relevant information for block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function creates a sorting key based on the block's type name and values, ensuring a stable and consistent ordering for block comparison. This should address the bug related to the incorrect block sorting.
