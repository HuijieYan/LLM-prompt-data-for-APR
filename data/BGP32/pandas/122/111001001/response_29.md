### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The comparison is done based on the sorted order of the blocks after canonicalization. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to correctly create a tuple for each block based on its dtype name and mgr_locs value. This tuple will ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

### Bug Fix Summary
In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function now generates a tuple with strings representing the dtype and mgr_locs of each block for proper sorting.
2. The sorted blocks are then compared for equality, ensuring correct comparison order.

By making these adjustments, the bug in the `equals` function related to block sorting is fixed, and the function should now work as intended for comparing two BlockManagers.
