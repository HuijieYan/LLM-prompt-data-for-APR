### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the comparison of blocks due to the way blocks are being canonicalized and compared. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks because each block consists of a tuple of dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` comparison is not handled correctly, leading to false negative results in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, including how `mgr_locs` is compared. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare blocks based on the dtype name and the actual values within `mgr_locs`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.blocks)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been adjusted to include the actual values within `mgr_locs.blocks` for comparison. This modification should ensure that the blocks are compared accurately and resolve the bug in the `equals` function.
