### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way block objects are being compared between `self` and `other`. The comparison logic sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations before performing the equality check. However, the bug occurs because the `block` object is being accessed incorrectly in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Location
The issue is in the `canonicalize` function where `block.dtype.name` is used to access the dtype of the block. However, in the context provided, `block` itself is a Block object (e.g., IntBlock, ObjectBlock) and does not have a direct attribute `dtype`. The correct attribute to access the dtype would be `block.dtype.dtype.name`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the dtype name of the block as shown below:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
