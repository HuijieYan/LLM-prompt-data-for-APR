### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic inside the function is flawed. It attempts to sort the blocks and then check their equality, but the sorting process is not considering the manager locations of the blocks, which are crucial in determining block equality.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function initializes `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. However, the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. It should be `block.mgr_locs` to access the manager locations, but it is incorrectly used as a method which causes the bug.
3. This incorrect usage leads to incorrect sorting of the blocks and hence, incorrect comparison when checking for block equality.
4. As a result, even if the blocks are the same, they might not align correctly due to the flawed sorting logic.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function by accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute directly instead of treating it as a method call. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and manager locations, allowing for an accurate comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this correction, the function will correctly sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, ensuring an accurate comparison for equality.
