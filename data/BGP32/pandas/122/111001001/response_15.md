The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The issue arises from the `block` variable being accessed without being properly instantiated. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `block` is correctly assigned with the corresponding block before calling `canonicalize`. We should iterate over `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` simultaneously to compare the blocks correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if canonicalize(self_block) != canonicalize(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the `block` variable is correctly assigned within the loop and compared against the corresponding block from the `other` object.

Please replace the existing `equals` function with this corrected version to address the bug.
