### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables. The comparison is done based on the `equals` method of the block objects, but the bug lies in the way the blocks are being sorted and compared. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is creating a tuple of the block's dtype name (e.g., `'int64'`) and its `mgr_locs` represented as a list. However, the comparison based on this sorting is not correct because `mgr_locs` is represented as a list.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the `mgr_locs` are correctly utilized for comparison. This may involve converting the `mgr_locs` to a format that can be compared effectively. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the fixed `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_slice(sSlice.like(0, 2, 1)).values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the fixed version, the `mgr_locs` are converted to a format that can be effectively used for comparison, ensuring proper sorting and comparison of the blocks.
