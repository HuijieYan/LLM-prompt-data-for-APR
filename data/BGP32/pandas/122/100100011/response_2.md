### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `DataFrame` objects in Pandas. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where the function wrongly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks might not handle the case where blocks are identical but in different locations.
2. The comparison logic between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not accurately determine equality.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks based on the block's type name and locations, which can lead to inconsistency when comparing DataFrames. The issue arises due to the nature of DataFrame block locations when they are unconsolidated, such as in the case of Categorical data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider additional factors that uniquely identify blocks. Additionally, we should update the comparison logic to accurately determine equality based on the sorted blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # improve canonicalize to consider additional factors
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include `block.values` alongside `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
