### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is used to compare two objects for equality. It compares the axes and blocks of two objects to determine equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks where unconsolidated blocks can only be distinguished by the iteration order.

### Error Location:
The bug may arise in the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type name and locations. This can lead to incorrect comparisons of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the implementation of the `canonicalize` function where it may not correctly distinguish unconsolidated blocks due to the use of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting. This can result in incorrect equality comparisons between DataFrame objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly identifies and sorts the blocks in a way that distinguishes unconsolidated blocks with different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more reliable method for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here's a corrected version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype and sorted values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, np.sort(block.values, axis=None))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, now the `equals()` function should correctly identify and compare blocks based on dtype and sorted values, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
