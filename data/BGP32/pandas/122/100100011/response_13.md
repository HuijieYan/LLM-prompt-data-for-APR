## Analysis:
1. The `equals` function from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is designed to check for equality between two internal data structures.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is checking if two DataFrames with different values should return `False` when using the `equals` function.
3. The GitHub issue describes that the `equals` function returns `True` incorrectly in the case of identical blocks with different locations, which is the bug we need to fix.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of two DataFrames.
2. The function sorts the blocks based on block attributes `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
3. If two identical blocks have different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True`.
4. In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have different values in the same location, so the `equals` function should return `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that it effectively distinguishes between identical blocks with different locations.
2. One possible fix is to combine more block attributes in the `canonicalize` function to create a unique representation for each block.
3. This unique representation should ensure that blocks with the same values but different locations are not considered equal.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining multiple block attributes
    # to uniquely identify each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly identify when two DataFrames with different values are not equal and pass the failing test case.
