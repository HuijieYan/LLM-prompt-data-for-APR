### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `managers.py` is used to check if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` checks if `DataFrame.equals` incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for cases where blocks have identical values but different locations.
4. The issue arises when comparing blocks using the `canonicalize` function based on block dtype names and locations, which may not account for different block locations resulting in incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function stems from sorting blocks based on dtype names and locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that blocks are compared based on their actual values, ignoring dtype names and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the blocks directly on their values without sorting based on dtype names and locations, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
