### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file is supposed to check if two objects are equal based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` is comparing two DataFrames with different column values, expecting `equals` to return False.
- The GitHub issue mentions that `equals` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Identified Error:
- The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not consider the actual values of the blocks, leading to incorrect results in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks.
- Instead of just using block dtype and manager locations, we should include the actual block values in the tuple for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, locations, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.values` in the comparison tuple, we ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual content, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
