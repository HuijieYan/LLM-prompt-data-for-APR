## Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file is designed to compare two objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the issue reported on GitHub highlights a scenario where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as equal.

## Error Location:
The issue seems to arise from the use of `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their dtype names and locations. This sorting may not be appropriate for identifying differences in blocks with the same content but different locations.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the values stored in the blocks themselves, resulting in incorrect equality comparison.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their data types and locations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()
    
    # Sort the blocks based on their content
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their content using the `values.tostring()` method, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
