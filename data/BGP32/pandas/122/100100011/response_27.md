### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in `managers.py` fails to correctly compare DataFrames when they have identical blocks with different locations. This issue was reported in GitHub with the title `BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations`.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on dtype and manager locations, but this logic is flawed, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect sorting of blocks based on dtype and locations. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be falsely identified as equal, leading to an incorrect `True` return value.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of sorting and comparing the blocks in the `equals` function to ensure that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. We can modify the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.index, block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on index and dtype, ensuring a proper comparison of blocks between the DataFrames. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function behave correctly for comparing DataFrames.
