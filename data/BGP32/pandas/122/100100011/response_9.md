### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file is used to compare two pandas DataFrames to check if they are equal. The bug is causing the function to return `True` even when the DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be handling blocks with identical contents but different locations correctly.
2. The comparison logic between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not be accurately checking for equality.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the `canonicalize` function handles the comparison between blocks in different DataFrames. If identical blocks are in different locations, they are not correctly recognized as equal, leading to an incorrect `True` return value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly.
2. Modify the comparison logic between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to accurately check for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.view(), block._consolidate().mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations. This fix should ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
