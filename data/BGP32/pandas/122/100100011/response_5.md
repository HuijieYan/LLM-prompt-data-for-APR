## Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of pandas is comparing two `DataFrame` objects based on their axes and blocks.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two `DataFrame` objects with different values but in the same order are not equal. This test is failing because the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in this case.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
- The issue is related to the comparison of `DataFrame` blocks using sorted order, which leads to incorrect equality checks.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which considers both `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to define block identity.
- Identical blocks with different locations can be incorrectly marked as equal due to this sorting.

## Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function to include more information that distinguishes blocks. In this case, we should include the actual block values in the tuple for comparison.
- By incorporating the block values as part of the sorting key, we can ensure that blocks with different values are not mistakenly considered equal during the comparison.

## Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block values for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying these changes and incorporating block values in the sorting key, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly identify and compare identical blocks with different locations, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
