## Identified issue:
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing DataFrames when they have identical blocks with different locations. This is causing the function to incorrectly return True in some cases where it should return False.

## Potential error location:
The issue lies in how the function is comparing and sorting the blocks within the DataFrames.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. This function is supposed to generate a key for comparison based on the block's data type and location. However, in cases where the block has identical data but different locations, the function fails to differentiate them, leading to incorrect comparisons.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data as well as its location. This way, blocks with identical data but different locations will be treated as different blocks during comparison.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider both data and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrames and return False in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
