### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames using their axes, blocks, and block content.
2. The bug is causing the function to wrongly return `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem and expects the function to return `False` in such cases.
4. The issue arises due to the comparison logic not accounting for different block locations.
5. A potential fix would involve modifying the comparison logic to also consider block locations.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations for each block.
2. Update the comparison logic to handle cases where block content is identical but the locations are different.
3. Compare `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` considering both block content and locations.
4. Ensure that the corrected function returns `False` when faced with the scenario described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare block content and locations
    return all(block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
               for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version accounts for block locations in addition to block content to address the issue described in the GitHub problem. It should now correctly determine when two DataFrames are not equal even if they have identical blocks but different locations.
