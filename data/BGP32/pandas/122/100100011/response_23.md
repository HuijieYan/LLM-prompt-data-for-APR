### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames for equality.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly identify DataFrames with identical data but different block locations.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides an example where two DataFrames with identical data but different block locations are incorrectly identified as equal.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the expected output is False, but the function incorrectly returns True due to the block sorting logic based on dtype name and manager locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` helper function, which sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This causes DataFrames with identical data but different block locations to be incorrectly identified as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on the data values rather than dtype name and manager locations to accurately compare DataFrames for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After implementing the corrected version of the function, the comparison will be based on the actual data values rather than dtype name and manager locations, ensuring accurate comparison results.
