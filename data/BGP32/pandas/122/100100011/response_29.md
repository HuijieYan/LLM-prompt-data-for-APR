### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This function is used to determine if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas.tests.internals.test_internals` is checking if two DataFrames with columns of different types are considered not equal, which is expected behavior. However, due to a bug in the `equals` method, it incorrectly returns True in this case.

The GitHub issue identified the problem accurately, stating that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on block type and locations. This sorting can result in two identical blocks being compared incorrectly due to different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of sorting by block type and locations in the `canonicalize` function. This can lead to identical blocks being considered different if they have different locations. When comparing the DataFrames, this leads to a wrong result where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that identical blocks are compared correctly regardless of their locations. One approach could be to sort the blocks based on block type only, without considering the locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version modifies the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on block type only, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly compared regardless of their locations. This modification should fix the bug and make the `equals` method behave as expected.
