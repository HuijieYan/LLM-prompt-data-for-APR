## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals()` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The failing test is the `test_dataframe_not_equal()` function in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.
- The GitHub issue is titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals()` function may not be correctly handling cases where identical blocks have different locations.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function may not be accurate.
3. The comparison of blocks in the final `return all(...)` statement may not be correctly identifying differences.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals()` function not accurately handling cases where identical blocks have different locations. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`, as demonstrated by the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals()` function to properly account for identical blocks with different locations. This may involve a more comprehensive check of block equality that considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just their locations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of just their locations, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
