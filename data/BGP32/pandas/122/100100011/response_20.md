## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames by first checking the number of axes, then checking if the axes are equal, consolidating the DataFrames in place, checking the number of blocks, and finally comparing each block in the DataFrames.
   
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns in different orders, expecting them to not be equal. However, the buggy `equals` function incorrectly returns True for these DataFrames.
   
3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` function does not handle the case where the blocks are identical but located differently.

## Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should also include the `mgr_locs` for distinguishing blocks with the same type name.
2. By including `mgr_locs` in the canonicalization process, blocks with the same type name but different locations will be properly distinguished and the `equals` function will return the correct result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying the correction, the `equals` function will correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and pass the failing test as expected.
