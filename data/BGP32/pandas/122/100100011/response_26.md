## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is used to compare two internal block managers for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` tests the equality of two dataframes that should not be equal.
3. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `df3` and `df4` are being incorrectly evaluated as equal by the `equals` function when they should not be.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting of blocks in the `equals` function based on the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. When the blocks have identical values but different locations, they are being treated as equal.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are being compared. We will compare the blocks based on values rather than their location to prevent erroneously marking them as equal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.dtypes.astype(str).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the block values and dtypes rather than their locations, the corrected version should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations and avoid the incorrect equality result.
