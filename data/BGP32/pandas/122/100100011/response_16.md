## Correction:

The issue with the `equals()` method lies in how it handles the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function should include information about the block's shape in addition to the block's dtype and mgr_locs. Adding the block's shape will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block's shape in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

After implementing this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal()` test case should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
