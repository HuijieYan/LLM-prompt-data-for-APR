### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is supposed to compare two DataFrame objects based on their axes, blocks, and block order. 
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` showcases a scenario where two DataFrames with different column data types fail the equality check incorrectly. This test has been associated with GitHub issue GH28839.
- The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True when it should return False due to the differences in column data types.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `equals` sorts the blocks of the two DataFrames based on a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. This sorting can potentially lead to incorrect results when certain blocks (like Categorical) are not consolidated.
- In the failing test, the two DataFrames have columns with data types that result in different ordering after the sorting operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To address the issue, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their content rather than the type name and location.
- This change will ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual content, avoiding the issue of incorrect equality check due to differences in block order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on contents for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After fixing the bug with the above corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully as expected.
