### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two objects for equality, specifically used in comparing DataFrames in pandas. The issue on GitHub mentions that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` might not be preserving the original order correctly.
3. The comparison in the return statement might be the source of the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the failing test provided, where two DataFrames with the same values but in a different order are considered equal, which is incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic in the `equals` function correctly identifies the DataFrames as not equal when the order of values is different. This can be achieved by modifying how the blocks are sorted and compared, ensuring that both the values and the order of values are taken into account.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without sorting based on locations, the corrected version ensures that the comparison includes the order of elements within the blocks. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test now passes.
