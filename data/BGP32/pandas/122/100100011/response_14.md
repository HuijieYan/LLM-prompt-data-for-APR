### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is responsible for comparing two objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, then iterates over each axis to check for equality. Next, it consolidates the objects in place and compares the blocks based on their type name and location.

The failing test in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` compares two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different data types in their columns. The `equals` function erroneously returns `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle cases where the blocks have identical data but with different locations. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and location using `canonicalize` function but does not compare the actual data values.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data values of the blocks if their types and locations are the same. We should add a comparison step for the block's data to ensure true equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After implementing this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test in `test_internals.py` should pass successfully.
