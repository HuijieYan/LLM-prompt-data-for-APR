The bug in the `equals` function is due to the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which is not handling the case where blocks are identical but have different locations. This leads to incorrect results when comparing the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the case where blocks are identical but have different locations. One way to achieve this is to include both the block's content and its location in the canonicalization process.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the content
    # and location to handle identical blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function will now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, ensuring that the comparison is accurate. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
