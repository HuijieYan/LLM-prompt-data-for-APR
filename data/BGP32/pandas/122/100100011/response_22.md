## Analysis:
- The `equals` method is used to determine if two `DataFrame` objects are equal.
- The bug is causing the method to incorrectly return `True` even when the data frames have different values at corresponding positions.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The bug may lie in the way the blocks within the data frames are compared.
- The `canonicalize` function may not be correctly identifying the differences between blocks.
- The sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize` might be causing the issue.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not properly distinguishing between identical blocks with different locations.
- As a result, even when the data frames have different values at corresponding positions, the method incorrectly returns `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it can correctly identify the differences between blocks.
- This modification should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal.

## Corrected Function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Adjusted canonicalize function to consider block values and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.T.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the fix provided above, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly distinguish between identical blocks with different locations and return the correct equality comparison result.
