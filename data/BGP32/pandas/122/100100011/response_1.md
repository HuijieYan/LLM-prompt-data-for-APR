### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is not comparing the DataFrames correctly. The issue posted on GitHub highlights that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `equals` function where it is comparing blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `equals` function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization method that includes both the type name and the `mgr_locs` (locations of the blocks), which can lead to different blocks being considered equal if they have the same type but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the blocks are compared without considering block locations as part of the canonicalization process.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the above correction, the `equals` function will only compare the blocks based on their data type without considering block locations, thus resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
