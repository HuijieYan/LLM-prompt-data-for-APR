### Corrections:

#### Bug Analysis:
The bug is within the `equals` method of the `DataFrame` class. The method is comparing two data frames `df1` and `df2` by first comparing their axes, then consolidating them and comparing the blocks. However, the issue arises when two data frames have identical blocks but with different locations. In this case, the method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the sorting of blocks within the `canonicalize` function. This sorting operation is based on the block's data type name and `mgr_locs`. When the blocks have identical data type names but different `mgr_locs`, the sorting may result in incorrectly pairing blocks during the final comparison step.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect sorting and comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to a wrong evaluation of data frames equality.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, taking into account that identical blocks with different locations should not be considered equal. One possible solution is to modify the sorting mechanism within the `equals` method to account for both data type names and actual block values.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.dtype)
    
    self_blocks = OrderedDict((canonicalize(block), block) for block in self.blocks)
    other_blocks = OrderedDict((canonicalize(block), block) for block in other.blocks)
    
    for key, block in self_blocks.items():
        if key not in other_blocks or not block.equals(other_blocks[key]):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In this corrected version:
1. The blocks are compared based on their actual values and data types in the `canonicalize` function.
2. `OrderedDict` is used to maintain the ordering of blocks and check for equality while considering identical block values with different locations.
3. The function now correctly compares blocks between the two data frames, ensuring that blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal. 

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
