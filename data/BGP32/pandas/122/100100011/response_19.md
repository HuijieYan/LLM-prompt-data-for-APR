## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in `pandas.core.internals.managers` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects.
- The bug seems related to the sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.
- The bug causes `equals` to return `True` even when the DataFrame blocks have the same elements but in different locations.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` showcases this bug by comparing two DataFrames with the same elements but different order.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function only considers the type name and manager locations of the blocks for sorting.
- If two blocks have the same elements but in a different order, they will be considered equal after sorting, leading to the incorrect `equals` comparison.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data in the blocks for sorting.
- We can generate a tuple of `(block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to include the block values in the sorting criteria.
- By including the block values in the sorting process, we ensure that the equality comparison accounts for both the structure and actual data in the blocks.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Include block values in the sorting key for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include block values in the sorting key, the corrected version of the function ensures proper comparison of DataFrame blocks and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
