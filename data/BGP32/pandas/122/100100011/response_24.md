### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames based on their axes and blocks.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in columns, expecting `False`.
3. The GitHub issue describes the problem where `equals` method wrongly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
4. The issue is due to the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison in the last line of the `equals` function. This approach does not consider the actual values present in the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function only checks the order and structure of blocks, but it does not compare the actual data values within the blocks. This leads to situations where two DataFrames with the same values but different block locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `equals` function to compare the actual values within the blocks of the DataFrames. Instead of relying solely on the block order and metadata, the function should compare the content present in the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the actual values within the blocks by calling the `values` attribute. Now, the function will correctly identify DataFrames with identical block values but different locations as not equal. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
