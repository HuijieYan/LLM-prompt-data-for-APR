### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The main issue causing the failing test is related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The sorting of blocks inside these attributes is leading to incorrect comparison due to the order of elements.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function extracts the blocks from `self` and `other` BlockManager instances and sorts them based on the function `canonicalize`.
2. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for comparison. This causes incorrect comparisons as the order of blocks can be different even if their contents are the same.
3. In the failing test case, the order of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` in `self` and `other` instances is different, leading to a false negative comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the blocks correctly without considering their order. One way to achieve this is to make use of sets. By converting the blocks to sets before comparison, we can ignore the order of elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, frozenset(block.mgr_locs.as_array.ravel().tolist()))

    self_blocks = set(map(canonicalize, self.blocks))
    other_blocks = set(map(canonicalize, other.blocks))
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In the corrected version, we convert the blocks to sets of tuples using a `canonicalize` function that converts the block information into a hashable format. By comparing the sets, we ensure that the order of blocks does not affect the comparison result.
