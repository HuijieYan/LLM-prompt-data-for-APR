### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `equals` is implemented within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. This function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.

### Potential error locations
1. Comparison of axes lengths.
2. Comparison of axes within a loop.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
4. The logic inside the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug cause
1. The current implementation of the `equals` function has a bug where the comparison of axes and the subsequent comparison of blocks is not being done correctly. This leads to a faulty equality check.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the equality comparison logic for axes and blocks to ensure correct comparison.
2. Debug the `canonicalize` function to ensure it returns the expected values for comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that axes lengths are properly compared, axes are compared correctly, and blocks are sorted and compared based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. Remember to test this corrected function with the failing test to verify that the bug has been fixed.
