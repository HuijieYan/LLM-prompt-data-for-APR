### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.

3. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, and it shows that the result of the comparison is `True` instead of `False`.

4. The bug is likely due to the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and manager locations, but there could be an issue with how the blocks are compared for equality or sorted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, taking into account the content and structure of the blocks.
2. Validate the sorting mechanism used for blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.
3. Confirm that the `equals` method handles different data types within blocks appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version aims to address the issue in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method by using a more robust sorting and comparison mechanism based on the block content and manager locations.
