### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`.

In the buggy function:
1. It compares the axes of `self` and `other`, but it then calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both objects, which could potentially modify the blocks data.
2. It sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on a canonicalization function, but does not consider the fact that this sorting may change the order of the blocks and impact the comparison.
3. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but the `mgr_locs` attribute isn't standard across all blocks and could result in erroneous comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of the blocks is maintained during comparison. We should avoid modifying the blocks data before comparison and consider a more stable criteria for sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()

    # Sort blocks based on a stable criteria
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: id(block))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: id(block))

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Ensuring that the block order is maintained by copying the blocks and sorting them based on id should correct the issue.
