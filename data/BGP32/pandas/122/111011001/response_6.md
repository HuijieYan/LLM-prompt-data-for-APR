### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. The error message indicates that the comparison is incorrectly returning True instead of False. From the provided runtime values, it's evident that the comparison logic is flawed due to the way blocks are being sorted and checked for equality.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the way blocks are being sorted before comparison. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not correctly handling block attributes. As a result, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not happening as expected, leading to a false positive equality check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly takes into account all relevant block attributes that determine equality. By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include all necessary attributes and ensure a more accurate sorting, we can correct the bug.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, taking into account all necessary block attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to consider all relevant block attributes, we ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared for equality, fixing the bug.
