### Analysis
The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, the test is failing because the buggy function is returning `True`.

The buggy function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other`, and then compares the blocks. However, the bug seems to arise in the comparison of blocks because the function fails to compare blocks correctly.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This conversion does not give the correct representation of the block's locations, leading to incorrect comparisons between blocks.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list needs to be corrected in the `canonicalize` function. Instead of calling `as_array.tolist()`, we should call `mgr_locs.to_slice()`. This will correctly convert the locations of the block to a slice object, ensuring proper block comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
