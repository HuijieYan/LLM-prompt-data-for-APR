### Bug Analysis
1. The failing test is checking if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, but it fails with `assert True is False`.
2. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block equality iteratively.
3. The bug lies in the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The ordering of blocks for comparison is incorrect, leading to the failed assertion.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparison.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by sorting the blocks based on their type name and location before comparing them in the `equals` function. This should now pass the failing test mentioned earlier.
