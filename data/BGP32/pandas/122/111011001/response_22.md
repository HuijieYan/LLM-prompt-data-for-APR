### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class where it is supposed to check if two instances are equal. The bug arises due to the comparison of data blocks between the two instances. The issue is that the canonicalization logic based on block properties is not consistent, leading to incorrect comparison results. 

The error message is due to the failing assertion where `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is expecting the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` to be not equal, but the function returns `True`. This discrepancy highlights a potential problem in the comparison logic implemented in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a consistent and accurate way of comparing the data blocks across the two instances. One approach would be to rely on the actual data contained within the blocks rather than their dtype or specific properties. We can achieve this by comparing the contents of the blocks directly, ensuring a more accurate equivalence check between instances.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on data contents
    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        (block_data == other_block_data).all() for block_data, other_block_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the actual block data values for equality rather than relying on their properties. This ensures a more robust and accurate comparison between two instances.
