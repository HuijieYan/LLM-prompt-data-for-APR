### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes, blocks, and block data.
   
2. The issue in the function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic involves sorting the blocks, and checking if corresponding blocks are equal. The error occurs because the blocks are not sorted in a consistent way, leading to incorrect comparisons.

3. In the failing test case:
   - The dataframes `df1` and `df2` have columns of different types.
   - When `df1.equals(df2)` is called, the `equals` method of `BlockManager` is used internally to compare the two dataframes.
   - The error message shows that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` incorrectly results in `True is False`, indicating a failed equality check.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Modify the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. Sort the blocks based on the block's column name instead of the dtype (data type) name.
   - Ensure that the block comparison is consistent and based on the same attribute for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on column name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items[0][0], block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After fixing the bug with the corrected version, the comparison between `df1` and `df2` should now correctly evaluate to `False`, passing the failing test.
