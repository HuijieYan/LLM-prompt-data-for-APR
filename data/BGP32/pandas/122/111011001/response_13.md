### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
- The function compares two BlockManagers (`self` and `other`) for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order.
- The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function which in turn calls the buggy `equals` function of `BlockManager`.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `True is False` failed, which suggests that the `equals` function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is likely due to the comparison of blocks in the function. The blocks are sorted based on `canonicalize` function which combines the type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. Since `mgr_locs` is not deterministic, the comparison can fail for differently ordered blocks that are actually equal (like in the failing test case).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of comparing blocks based on `mgr_locs`, use a different approach to ensure a consistent and reliable sorting mechanism.
2. Focus on comparing the content of the blocks rather than relying on `mgr_locs`.
3. Ensure a deterministic way to compare the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on data content without relying on mgr_locs
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content rather than `mgr_locs`, the corrected version should ensure a more reliable comparison for equality, passing the failing test case.
