### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method is using the `dtype.name` attribute of the block to compare blocks. This comparison fails when the DataFrames have columns with different data types. In the failing test case, the DataFrames have columns with different data types (`int64` and `object`), causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and the actual values of the blocks, ensuring a more robust comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method with an updated `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using both data type and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their data values in addition to their data types, making the comparison more reliable across DataFrames with different data types in their columns.
