### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks between `self` and `other`. When creating `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the function attempts to sort the blocks using a custom key (`canonicalize`) that involves the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` inside the `all()` function fails to correctly compare the blocks due to the manner the `mgr_locs` are handled.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises when creating `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which includes the block's `mgr_locs`. The `mgr_locs` are later converted to a list erroneously in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To correct the bug, ensure that the `canonicalize` function returns a consistent and reliable representation of the blocks for comparison. Since `mgr_locs` is being incorrectly converted to a list, it is necessary to consider an alternative approach that can accurately represent the block's locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` directly without converting `mgr_locs` to a list. This ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared accurately based on dtype and locations.
