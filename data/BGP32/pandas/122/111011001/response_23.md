### Issue:
The buggy function is not correctly comparing two BlockManager instances for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers, then consolidates the internal data, and finally compares the blocks within the BlockManagers. The error arises from not handling the blocks comparison properly, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

### Explanation:
1. The function first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers (`self_axes` and `other_axes`) and ensures that they have the same length and content.
2. It then consolidates the internal data of both BlockManagers using the `_consolidate_inplace()` method to ensure consistent comparison.
3. The function then compares the number of blocks in each BlockManager and proceeds to sort and compare the blocks.
4. The comparison of blocks is done by sorting them based on the block's datatype name and locations (`mgr_locs`). However, the comparison logic inside `canonicalize(block)` is not handling the block comparison correctly. It is likely leading to the incorrect comparison result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize(block)` function to properly represent and compare the blocks based on their dtype name and location.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the two BlockManagers considers all relevant characteristics for equality assessment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Comparison function for sorting blocks
    def compare_blocks(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect block comparison logic and ensures a proper equality check for the two BlockManager instances.
