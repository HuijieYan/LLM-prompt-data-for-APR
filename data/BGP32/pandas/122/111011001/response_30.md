### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the provided test case where two `DataFrame` instances are given with columns of different types.

The function extracts axes and blocks from both `self` and `other` instances, compares their lengths, then compares the axes for equality. After that, it consolidates both instances using the `_consolidate_inplace` method (which seems unnecessary for equality checking). The last part involves sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and the `mgr_locs` attribute before comparing each block for equality.

### Bug
The bug arises from the comparison logic when sorting and comparing the blocks. The blocks are sorted based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but when comparing for equality, it directly uses the `equals` method on the blocks without considering that the column order might be different between `self` and `other` instances.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the block comparison logic to sort and compare blocks based on their position within the `BlockManager` structure rather than just dtype and `mgr_locs`. We should compare blocks based on their position within the columns and ensure that the order of columns is consistent between `self` and `other`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Skip the unnecessary consolidation step
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on their position within the DataFrame
    self_blocks = self.get_blocks_sorted()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks_sorted()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

def get_blocks_sorted(self):
    def block_position(block):
        return self.blocks.index(block)
    
    return sorted(self.blocks, key=block_position)
```

In the corrected version, the `BlockManager` class has a new method `get_blocks_sorted` that sorts the blocks based on their position within the structure. This ensures that when comparing blocks for equality, the comparison is based on the actual position of the blocks within the `BlockManager` rather than their attributes. This change should fix the bug and make the `equals` method work correctly for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
