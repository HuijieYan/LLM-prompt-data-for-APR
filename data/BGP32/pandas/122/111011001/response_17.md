### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and the data within the blocks. The function compares the axes and the number of blocks and then attempts to sort the blocks to compare them individually. However, the bug seems to arise from incorrect comparison within the block sorting process, leading to a failure in the test case provided.

### Issue
The bug occurs when attempting to sort the blocks based on a tuple combining the block type and `mgr_locs` attribute. This approach is valid in concept, but the implementation is incorrect, which results in a failure when comparing the blocks.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks based on the block type and `mgr_locs`. It seems like the current approach is not extracting the correct information to enable proper comparison. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the necessary attributes for block comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the function should be able to correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test case provided.
