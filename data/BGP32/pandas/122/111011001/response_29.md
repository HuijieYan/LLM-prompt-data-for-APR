### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class by comparing their axes and blocks. The function fails to return the expected value, leading to failed tests.

The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, indicating that the function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManager instances is incorrect. The comparison logic sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the bug might arise from not handling categorical blocks properly.

### Bug Explanation
1. The comparison logic in the buggy function fails to handle unconsolidated blocks adequately, especially in the case of categorical blocks.
2. Sorting blocks using `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` might not be sufficient for properly comparing the contents of categorical blocks.
3. Due to the incorrect handling of unconsolidated blocks, the function wrongly returns `True` even when the DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the handling of unconsolidated blocks, specifically focusing on categorical blocks that may not be properly compared using the current sorting approach. 
We should ensure that the comparison includes a proper check for categorical data types and their unique handling requirements to avoid mistakenly returning `True` when the DataFrames are actually not equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def sort_key(block):
        block_type = block.dtype.name
        if block_type == 'categorical':
            block_data = block.values
        else:
            block_data = block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        return block_type, block_data

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a modification to the `sort_key` function that now considers the type of the block (`categorical`) and appropriately handles the data for sorting. This change ensures that categorical blocks are sorted correctly, leading to a proper comparison between the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances.
