### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes, number of blocks, and the content of each block are equal between the two instances.
- The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, which have columns with different types in the opposite order.
- The failing assertion message indicates that the comparison failed even though it was expected to be false.
- In the buggy function, the code sorts the blocks based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, and then compares the sorted blocks between two BlockManagers.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the sorting mechanism used in the function `equals` doesn't handle the case where the columns have different types in different orders. Since the blocks are sorted based on the dtype name and mgr_locs, the comparison fails when the DataFrame's columns are in a different order.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and the column label while sorting the blocks. This way, blocks with different dtypes or column orders will be properly compared.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering the dtype name and column labels
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By explicitly including the column labels in the sorting criteria, the corrected function provides a more robust comparison between two BlockManager instances, fixing the bug described.
