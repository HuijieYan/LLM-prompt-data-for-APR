### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes, number of blocks, and the equality of individual blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug is likely related to the comparison of individual blocks within the `BlockManager`.

### Issues
1. The `block` object used in the `canonicalize` function is trying to access the attribute `dtype.name`, which may not be valid.
2. The `canonicalize` function is trying to access `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which also may not be valid.
3. The assertion failure indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing unequal `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Verify the correct attribute to use for the block dtype in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Verify the correct attribute to use for obtaining manager locations in the `canonicalize` function.
3. Ensure the comparison of individual blocks is correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now correctly pulls the block type and manager locations for comparison.
- Ensure that the corrected version handles the comparison of individual blocks accurately to determine the equality of `BlockManager` objects.
