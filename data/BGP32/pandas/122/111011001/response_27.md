### Issue:
The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` condition is returning `True` rather than `False`. This discrepancy suggests that the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to an incorrect evaluation in the test.

### Analysis:
1. The `equals()` function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality.
2. The comparison is done by iterating over the blocks and checking if each block equals the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.
3. The function uses sorting based on data types and locations to compare the blocks.
4. The issue might arise from how the blocks are sorted and compared, leading to a false negative in the equality check.

### Suggested Fix:
To address the bug, we need to modify the block sorting logic and comparison step in the `equals()` function to ensure a proper comparison of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on data types and locations'
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality for each block in sorted order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now sorts the blocks based on the block type name and `mgr_locs`. This ensures consistent ordering for comparison. The `equals()` function now maintains the correct logic for comparing the blocks, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
