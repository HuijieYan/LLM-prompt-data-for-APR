### Bug Analysis
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug occurs because the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is flawed, leading to incorrect evaluation.
4. The comparison logic currently sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on their dtype and mgr_locs, which results in incorrect comparison when the data in `self` and `other` is not aligned properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to improve the comparison logic to ensure that the data in corresponding blocks is actually compared.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self._block_equals(self_block, other_block):
            return False

    return True

def _block_equals(self_block, other_block):
    if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
        return False

    if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
        return False

    self_values = self_block.values
    other_values = other_block.values

    return np.array_equal(self_values, other_values)
```

The updated version introduces a new method `_block_equals` to compare individual blocks of data within the `BlockManager` instances. This method ensures that the values within the blocks are compared for equality, fixing the bug in the comparison logic.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
