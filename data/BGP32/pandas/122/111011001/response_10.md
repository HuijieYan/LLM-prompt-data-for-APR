### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if they are equal in terms of axes, blocks, and their content.
2. The error occurs because during the comparison of the blocks, there is a mismatch in the order of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` due to the way they are sorted.
3. The failing test is asserting that `df1` does not equal `df2`, but the comparison inside the buggy function is returning `True`, causing the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After implementing this fix, the function will correctly compare the two `BlockManager` objects by ensuring that the blocks are sorted in the same way before performing the equality check. This should resolve the failing test.
