### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function tries to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their data types and locations, and then compares each block pairwise. The bug seems to stem from incorrectly handling the blocks and their order during comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are the same, failing if they have different lengths.
2. It then iterates through the blocks of each `BlockManager`, sorts them based on data type and location, and attempts to compare them. 
3. The comparison is done using the `equals` method, but might be incorrect due to issues with the `canonicalize` function or how blocks are compared.

The failing test case involves comparing two DataFrames with swapped data types and failing the assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the axes of both `BlockManager` instances match before proceeding to block comparison.
2. Fix any issues related to the `canonicalize` function or block comparison logic to accurately check block equality.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
        
    return True
```

Applying the corrected code should address the issue and make the test pass successfully.
