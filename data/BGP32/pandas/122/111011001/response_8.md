### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.

The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison logic in the method. The method first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and makes sure they have the same length. Then, it attempts to compare the blocks within the instances. The issue arises during the comparison of blocks because the blocks are sorted differently for `self` and `other` instances, leading to a false positive comparison result.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the portion of the code where `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted before the comparison. This sorting is done using a `canonicalize` function that combines the block's data type name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. Since the blocks are sorted differently for `self` and `other` instances, the comparison fails.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks using different orderings for `self` and `other` instances. This leads to a mismatched comparison between the blocks even if they contain the same data.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order for both `self` and `other` instances. This can be achieved by using a consistent sorting key that considers the properties of both blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a consistent sorting key for blocks
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `block_sort_key` function to define a consistent sorting key for blocks, we ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order for both `self` and `other` instances. This will correctly compare the blocks and fix the bug.
