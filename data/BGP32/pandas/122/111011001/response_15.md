### Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail. The test is checking if two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal by using the `equals` method, but it is incorrectly evaluating to `True` instead of `False`.

Here are the potential issues in the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may be incorrect.
2. The comparison of the number of blocks in `self` and `other` may be flawed.
3. The `canonicalize` function may not be generating the expected output for block comparison.
4. The comparison of blocks using `equals` might not be working as intended.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be in the block comparison logic. The function sorts the blocks by dtype name and manager locations but the manager locations are not correctly converted to a list before comparison. This causes the comparison to fail even when the blocks are equal.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` actually converts the manager locations to a list before comparison. This will ensure that the block comparison works correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring the correct conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list before comparison, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
