### Analysis
The buggy function is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The function first checks if the number of axes is the same between the two instances. It then iterates over each axis to check if they are equal. After that, it consolidates both instances in place, checks the number of blocks, and finally, compares each block between the two instances.

The error message indicates that the comparison between the two instances is returning `True` when it should be `False`, leading to the test failure. This indicates that the equality comparison logic inside the buggy function is not working as expected.

Upon analyzing the runtime values of the variables, especially the axes and blocks of both instances, we can see that the axes and block order are not consistent between `self` and `other` instances, which causes the equality comparison to fail erroneously.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistent block order between the `self` and `other` instances, leading to a false comparison result. The current implementation of sorting blocks using `canonicalize` might not be sufficient to handle all cases appropriately. It results in sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which can be misleading if the blocks are not correctly ordered in both instances.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between `self` and `other` instances considers the blocks more accurately. Instead of relying solely on sorting blocks using `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we should devise a more robust strategy to compare the blocks between the two instances consistently.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def get_tuple(key):
        return tuple(np.asarray(block.data).tobytes() for block in self.blocks[key])
    
    self_blocks = {get_tuple(i): i for i in range(len(self.blocks))}
    other_blocks = {get_tuple(i): i for i in range(len(other.blocks))}
    
    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False
    
    return all(self.blocks[key].equals(other.blocks[other_blocks[key]]) for key in self_blocks)
```

In the corrected version, we use a more robust method to create tuple keys for the blocks in each instance. By comparing the keys between the two instances, we ensure that the blocks are matched consistently, providing a more accurate equality comparison.
