### Bug Analysis:
The failing test is checking if two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal using the `equals` method, which is implemented in the `BlockManager` class. The error message shows that the comparison is returning True instead of False, indicating that the `equals` method is not functioning correctly.

In the buggy `equals` function:
1. It compares the axes of `self` and `other`, then consolidates both in place.
2. It checks the number of blocks in `self` and `other` and returns False if they are not equal.
3. It sorts the blocks in `self` and `other` based on a canonicalization function for comparison.

The bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the canonicalization function generates unique identifiers for the blocks.
2. Check if all blocks in `self` match corresponding blocks in `other` after sorting.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), hash(str(block.mgr_locs)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses a combination of the block's dtype in string form and the hash of the block's `mgr_locs` to generate unique identifiers. Sorting the blocks using these identifiers ensures a consistent order for comparison.
