### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing because it incorrectly checks the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances and returns false if any difference is found. However, the function fails to handle the case where the blocks are re-ordered during the comparison.

In the failing test scenario provided, the function is called with two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`) that have the same columns, but the ordering of the columns is different. When comparing the two instances in the buggy `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` because it does not consider the order of the blocks while comparing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison includes checking the ordered blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a consistent order before comparing them. By including a sorting mechanism based on certain block properties like dtype name and mgr_locs, we can ensure a consistent comparison and handle cases where the ordering of the blocks may differ.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # sort blocks for consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances are sorted based on their dtype names and mgr_locs before comparison. This sorting mechanism helps to handle cases where the blocks might be in different orders but still represent the same data.
