### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas` library. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the comparison returned `True` when it should have been `False`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is comparing blocks in a non-canonical order, which leads to incorrect comparison results.
4. One potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order before comparing them, to remove the ambiguity introduced by different sorting as evidenced by the failing test case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort self and other blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks in a consistent order before comparing them, we ensure that similar blocks are matched correctly regardless of their original order. This should address the bug and resolve the failing test case.
