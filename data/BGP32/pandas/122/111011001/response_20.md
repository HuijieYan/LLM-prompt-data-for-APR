### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then sorts and compares the blocks for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`.
3. The buggy function compares the blocks by sorting them based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` before giving the final result. The issue might arise from incorrect sorting or comparison within the blocks.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly to correctly determine equality between the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, modify the sorting and comparison of blocks as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix ensures that the blocks are sorted based on the string representation of the `dtype` and the raw bytes of the `mgr_locs`. This should correctly compare the blocks and return the expected equality result between the `BlockManager` instances.
