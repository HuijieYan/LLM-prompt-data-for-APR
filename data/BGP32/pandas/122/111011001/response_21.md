### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class arises from the incorrect comparison of values in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function tries to sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` operation is incorrect, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issue in the `equals` method, we need to correctly handle the comparison of blocks. Specifically, we should update the `canonicalize` function in a way that it correctly handles the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        locs = block.mgr_locs.blocks[0].tolist()  # extract locs correctly
        return (block.dtype.name, locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function specifically extracts the locs from `block.mgr_locs` correctly and forms the tuple for comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method work as intended.
