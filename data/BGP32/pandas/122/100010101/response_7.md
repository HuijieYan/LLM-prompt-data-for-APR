### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function currently compares the axes and blocks for equality. However, in the failing test case, the data in the dataframes is swapped for columns 'a' and 'b'. This leads to the dataframes not being equal when compared by `equals` method.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the function arises from the comparison of blocks directly without considering the actual data within the blocks. When comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the function should compare the data within the blocks, not just the metadata like block types.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` erroneously when comparing dataframes with similar types of blocks but different data. This is why the test fails and asserts that the result should be `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to iterate over the rows of each block and compare the actual values instead of just comparing the metadata. This can be done by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the data values when sorting the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes the block values along with block metadata (type and locations) when sorting the blocks. It then compares the actual block values to ensure the correctness of the equality comparison between `self` and `other`.
