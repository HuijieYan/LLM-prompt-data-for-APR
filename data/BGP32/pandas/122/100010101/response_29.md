The buggy function is the `equals` method which is part of a class. The function aims to compare two instances of the class by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. This mismatch in return values is causing the test to fail.

The potential error locations in the function could be:
1. Incorrect comparison logic in the conditional statements.
2. Misinterpretation of the input data structure.

The cause of the bug seems to be in how the function compares the blocks. The function sorts the blocks before comparison based on their data type name and manager locations. If the data in the blocks are not the same type, but have the same data values (like integers and strings in this case), the equality check with `equals` will return `True` incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function. We can add an additional condition to check the data types of the blocks before comparing them. If the data types are different, we can directly return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if block data types are different
    if any(type(block) != type(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for block data types before comparing them. This change ensures that the function accurately compares the blocks and returns the correct result.
