### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block content are equal.
- The error message shows an assertion failure where the comparison of `df1` and `df2` using `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`.
- The expected input values for `df1` and `df2` are dataframes with different values in corresponding columns, which should lead to them being determined as not equal by the `equals` function.
- The potential error lies in the comparison logic within the function, where it might not consider the values within the blocks when determining equality.
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to include block content comparison as well.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to also include a comparison of values within the blocks while sorting and iterating over the blocks.
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks for different data types like integers, objects, etc.
- Ensure that the function returns `False` if any block content is not equal between the two `BlockManager` objects being compared.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())  # Include block values for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Additional check to compare block values
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes block values while comparing `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the function considers content in addition to axes and block structure.
