### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are of the same length. Then, it iterates over the blocks within each `BlockManager`, sorts them, and compares them individually.

The error message indicates that when comparing `df1` and `df2` DataFrames using the `equals` function, the assertion fails, suggesting that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The error message shows that the function is returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal, leading to an assertion failure.
2. The expected behavior should be for the function to return `False` when the two DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and returns `False` when the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal. This improvement can be accomplished by accurately comparing all the attributes of the `BlockManager` objects to decide if they are equal or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.items()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.items()
  
    # Check if all blocks are equal in both BlockManagers
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not all(self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_block, other_block)):
            return False

    return True
``` 

With this corrected function, the comparisons of the `BlockManager` objects should be accurate.
