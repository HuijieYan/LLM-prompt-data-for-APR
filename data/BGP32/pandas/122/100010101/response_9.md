### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
- The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two unequal `DataFrame` objects.
- The function compares the axes of two `BlockManagers`, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs.
- The error is likely due to incorrectly handling the dtype information or the ordering of blocks during comparison.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in how the blocks are being sorted based on their dtype and mgr_locs. This can lead to unequal blocks being considered equal during comparison.

### Fix strategy:
1. Ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently based on dtype and mgr_locs to maintain a deterministic order for comparison.
2. Verify that the logic for comparing blocks is correctly implemented to handle different data types and block locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures a consistent ordering of blocks for comparison and addresses the bug identified in the function.
