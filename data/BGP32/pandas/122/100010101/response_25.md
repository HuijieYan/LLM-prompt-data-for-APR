### Analysis:
1. The error message shows that the `assert df1.equals(df2)` is failing where `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` function is not behaving as expected.
2. The `equals` function compares two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`) based on their axes and blocks.
3. The expected inputs include DataFrame objects (`df1` and `df2`), each with two columns ('a' and 'b') containing different types of values.
4. The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the `equals` function, where it fails to handle DataFrame objects with columns in different order or different types.
5. The bug can be fixed by sorting the columns within each DataFrame before comparison to ensure consistency.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtypes.to_dict(),
            [col for col in block if block.dtypes[col] == 'object'],
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The bug fix includes sorting the columns based on data types before comparison in order to ensure consistent behavior regardless of column order or type differences within the DataFrames.
