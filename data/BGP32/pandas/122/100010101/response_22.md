### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function checks if the axes of both `BlockManager` instances are of equal length and if all the corresponding axes are equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager` before comparing them. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug in the Code
The bug is in the way the function is canonicalizing and sorting the blocks before comparison. This leads to an incorrect comparison between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance are correctly sorted and compared. This involves sorting the blocks based on appropriate criteria before performing the equality check.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    # Consolidate blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all corresponding blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the corrections, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances by first consolidating the blocks and then sorting and comparing them based on dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared correctly for equality.
