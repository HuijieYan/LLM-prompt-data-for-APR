### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method in a pandas class. The error message suggests that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. The expected input parameters are two pandas `BlockManager` objects representing dataframes, with specific axes and blocks.

The code compares the axes of the input dataframes first, then it tries to sort and compare the blocks within the dataframes. The error seems to be related to the comparison of blocks due to the data type mismatch between the columns of the two dataframes.

### Bug
The bug likely occurs when comparing the blocks. The code fails to handle the case where the data types in the columns of the dataframes are different.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add an additional check when comparing the blocks of the dataframes. Specifically, we should compare the data types of the blocks before proceeding with the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block.dtype.name != oblock.dtype.name:
            return False
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

The corrected version of the function includes a check for the data type of the blocks before comparing them. This ensures that the code handles cases where the columns have different data types.
