### Analysis
The function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal. Then, it compares each axis of `self` with the corresponding axis of `other`. Next, it consolidates both `self` and `other` BlockManagers. After that, it checks if the number of blocks in each BlockManager is equal. Finally, it sorts the blocks within each BlockManager based on a canonical representation and compares the sorted blocks.

### Bug
The bug is likely in the sorting step where it sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` function. Since it's sorting based on `dtype.name` followed by `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the comparison might not be accurate, especially for block types like Categorical. This causes the function to fail the comparison in some cases.

### Fix
To fix this bug, it would be better to compare blocks without sorting them based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. Instead, we should directly compare the blocks in the original order.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the sorting step and directly comparing the blocks in the original order, the corrected function ensures a more accurate comparison. This will resolve the issue with inaccurate comparisons for certain block types.
