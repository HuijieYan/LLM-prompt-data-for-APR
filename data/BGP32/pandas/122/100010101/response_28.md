### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` failed, returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The bug is likely due to comparing columns of different types between `df1` and `df2`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle columns of different types properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison logic to handle columns of different types by checking if the column types match instead of directly comparing them.
2. Ensure that the comparison logic correctly identifies differences in column types when comparing `self` and `other` `BlockManagers`.
3. Sort the blocks based on both type and location to ensure consistent comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on both type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type as well, the corrected version of the function will correctly handle comparisons between different types of blocks. This fix ensures that the `equals` function can correctly identify differences and return the expected results.
