### Identified bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is that it is not handling the comparison of DataFrame blocks correctly. The function sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function before comparing them. This sorting logic can lead to incorrect evaluation, especially when the DataFrame blocks have different data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on data type and manager locations. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have columns of different data types (`int64` and `object`), causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to address the way the function compares DataFrame blocks. Instead of sorting the blocks based on data type and manager locations, we should compare blocks directly. We can remove the sorting step and directly compare corresponding blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
# Updated equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function directly compares corresponding blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting them based on data type and manager locations. This approach ensures that the function correctly evaluates DataFrame equality without being affected by differences in data types between blocks.
