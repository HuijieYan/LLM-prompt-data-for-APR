### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
   
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the function returned `True` instead of `False`.
   
3. The expected input values show two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in their columns. Therefore, the `equals()` function should identify this discrepancy and return `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the faulty comparison logic within the `equals()` function. It fails to properly compare the content of the DataFrames and instead compares their internal block representations, ultimately leading to the incorrect `True` return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare the actual content of the DataFrames rather than their internal block structures. This can be achieved by comparing column-wise values instead of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if self_axes[0].equals(other_axes[0]) and self_axes[1].equals(other_axes[1]):  # compare column indices
        for idx in self_axes[0]:  # iterate over columns
            if not self._data[idx].equals(other._data[idx]):  # compare column data
                return False
        return True
    return False
``` 

This corrected implementation compares the column indices first and then iterates over each column, comparing their data values. If any discrepancies are found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` if both DataFrames have the same columns and matching data.
