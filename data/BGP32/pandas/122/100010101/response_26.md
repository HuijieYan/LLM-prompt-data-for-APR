The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances to determine if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and data. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, suggesting that the function is not properly identifying the inequality between `df1` and `df2`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function compares the two objects based on their axes first, then checks the equivalence of their blocks. However, in the provided test case, `df1` and `df2` have different values in the respective columns 'a' and 'b'. This should result in a return value of `False`, but the function is failing to detect this discrepancy.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equality check in the function to consider the data stored in the blocks. This modification should ensure that the comparison includes checking the actual data values in addition to the structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all((self._get_column_array(ax1) == other._get_column_array(ax2)).all() for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
def _get_column_array(self, ax):
    if isinstance(ax, pd.Index):
        return ax.values
    return ax
```

In the corrected version, the function `_get_column_array` is added to extract the column values from the axes. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function is updated to verify the equality of the column values. This update ensures that the function accurately determines the equality between two instances based on their data.
