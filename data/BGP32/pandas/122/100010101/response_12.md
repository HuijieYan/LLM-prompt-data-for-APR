### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, which consist of different attributes like `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with the message `assert True is False`.
3. The expected values show the attributes of the `BlockManager` objects and their components that need to be compared for equality.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation stems from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the bug causes incorrect block comparison and classification.

The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are correctly sorted and compared. We should consider alternative methods for comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. One approach could be to directly compare the values within the blocks to check for equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def check_blocks_equal(blocks1, blocks2):
        if len(blocks1) != len(blocks2):
            return False
        for block1, block2 in zip(blocks1, blocks2):
            if not block1.equals(block2):  # Directly compare blocks for equality
                return False
        return True

    return check_blocks_equal(self.blocks, other.blocks)
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function now directly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects for equality. This approach should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` objects.
