### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
- The error message states that `assert True is False` which is incorrect since the expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return `False` for the given test case.
- The error message also provides the string representations of the two `DataFrame` objects being compared.

### Potential Error Location:
- The error might be occurring in the comparison logic inside the `canonicalize` function where the blocks are being compared for equality.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be caused by the comparison of blocks inside the `equals` function using the `canonicalize` function, which is not correctly distinguishing the data blocks' content for the test case.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function correctly distinguishes the data blocks based on their contents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(),)  # modifying canonicalize logic to compare block values directly

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on their content for the given test case, and the test should pass successfully.
