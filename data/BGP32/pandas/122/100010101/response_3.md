### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
- The function first compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, but the problem likely arises in the subsequent comparisons involving blocks.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks might not consider the actual values in the blocks but only their data types and locations. This leads to incorrect comparisons between the blocks, resulting in the function erroneously returning `True` when comparing `df1` and `df2`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the actual block values during sorting, ensuring that the comparison considers the values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Fixing the sorting criteria to include actual block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version ensures that the comparisons between blocks are based on their actual values. This modification resolves the bug and should now correctly compare two BlockManager objects for equality.
