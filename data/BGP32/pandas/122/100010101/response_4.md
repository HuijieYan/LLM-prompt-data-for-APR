### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method within a class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them and comparing the blocks within. The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes (`df1` and `df2`) fails unexpectedly.

### Bugs
1. The bug is likely in the comparison of the axes. It involves comparing the column labels against the column labels of the other dataframe.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function does not account for the case where the columns change positions between dataframes, leading to false comparison results.
3. The error message shows that the assertion failure occurs because the method returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the axis comparison to handle cases where the columns can be in different positions between the dataframes.
2. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple that reliably captures the properties of the blocks to enable accurate sorting.
3. Adjust the return statements to correctly return `False` when the dataframes are not equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.ftype)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.ftype)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- The comparison of axes is modified to check if both dataframes contain the same set of axes.
- The sorting of blocks is done based on the ftype of the blocks to handle cases where columns may change positions.
- The return statement is updated to return `False` if the dataframes are not equal.
