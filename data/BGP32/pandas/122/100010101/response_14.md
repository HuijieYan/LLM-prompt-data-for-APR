### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The bug arises from the fact that the function is mistakenly comparing columns from one `BlockManager` with columns from the other `BlockManager` in the wrong order, leading to a false assertion error.

1. The function compares the axes of `self` and `other` to ensure they have the same length. If not, it returns `False`.
2. It then checks if the columns of `self` and `other` match by iterating over them and using the `equals` method. If any pair of columns is not equal, the function returns `False`.
3. It then consolidates both `self` and `other` to ensure they are optimized for comparison.
4. Next, it compares the number of blocks in `self` with the number of blocks in `other`. If they are not the same, it returns `False`.
5. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` based on block properties and then compares each block with its counterpart. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the columns are being compared correctly between `self` and `other`. Sorting the blocks based on properties like data type and location won't necessarily solve the issue if the column order is incorrect. Therefore, we need to adjust how the columns are compared during the iteration step to ensure the correct comparison between columns from `self` and `other`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for self_col, other_col in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not self_col.equals(other_col):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the function now iterates over the columns of `self` and `other` directly, ensuring the correct comparison and fixing the bug that caused the false assertion error.
