### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManagers for equality. It compares the axes, consolidates the BlockManagers, and then compares the blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, suggesting that the function is not returning the expected result when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.
3. Based on the error message, the input DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns of different types and are arranged in a different order.
4. The bug seems to be caused by comparing columns based on their position and not their names.
5. To fix the bug, we need to compare columns based on their names rather than their positions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on column names instead of positions.
2. Update the comparison logic to include a check for column names.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.items())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrames based on column names rather than positions. It should pass the failing test case provided.
