### Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of BlockManager (`self` and `other`) for equality.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, which suggests a logical error in the function.
- The function checks the equality of axes, blocks, and individual blocks within the BlockManager instances to determine equality.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug likely arises from the comparison of columns in `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
- The function compares the columns by their data types and memory locations but fails to consider the actual values within the columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual values within the columns of `self` and `other` BlockManagers instead of just their data types and memory locations.
- We need to modify the comparison logic to directly compare the values in corresponding columns of `self` and `other`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if corresponding blocks are equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, we are explicitly comparing the values in corresponding blocks of `self` and `other`. This should address the logical error and ensure correct comparison for equality.
