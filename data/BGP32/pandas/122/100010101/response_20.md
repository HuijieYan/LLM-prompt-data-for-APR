### Analysis
The buggy function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes, blocks, and the elements within the blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing when comparing two `DataFrame` instances that have different values in corresponding positions.

### Bug
The buggy function does not account for differences in values when comparing the two `BlockManager` instances. It currently only checks the axes and blocks without considering the actual data within the blocks.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. We can do this by iterating over each block and comparing their contents.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

Now, the corrected function compares the actual values within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.
