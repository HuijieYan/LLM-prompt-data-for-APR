### Analysis
The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.

### Identified Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the comparison logic within the function. In this case, the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have columns of different data types, resulting in the equals function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle cases where columns have different data types. We should ensure that the comparison considers the data values as well, not just the data types and metadata.

### Updated Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(
        (ax1.equals(ax2) and self._data.equals(other._data)) 
        for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._data.dtypes[0].name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This updated version of the function now includes a comparison between the data of the blocks to handle different data types within columns. It should now pass the failing test case mentioned.
