### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function is a method `equals` within a class that compares two BlockManagers. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and it shows that `True is False` which means the comparison returned True incorrectly.

### Error Location
The error lies in the logic of comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, the code attempts to compare the blocks within the BlockManagers by sorting them based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. However, in the given test case, the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types, causing the comparison to return True incorrectly because the dtype name comparison is incorrect for the specific case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the blocks are being compared. Instead of relying solely on sorting by dtype name and mgr_locs, we might need to add logic to handle cases where columns have different data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def is_equal_blocks(block, oblock):
        if block.dtype != oblock.dtype:
            return False
        if block.values.shape != oblock.values.shape:
            return False
        return block.values.tolist() == oblock.values.tolist()

    return all(
        is_equal_blocks(block, oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a new `is_equal_blocks` function that compares the blocks based on dtype, shape, and values directly to handle cases where columns have different data types.
