### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the function is not handling the comparison of different data types correctly. The error message indicates that the comparison between DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` fails. This failure is due to the wrong comparison strategy used in the buggy function.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function `equals` is treating the comparison of columns with different data types (int and object in this case) as equal, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for differences in data types during the comparison of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will now compare blocks based on both data type and location, which will resolve the issue and allow for proper comparison of DataFrame objects with different data types.
