### Analysis:
- The buggy `equals` function is comparing two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`) to check if they are equal.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it evaluates to `True`. This suggests that the `equals` function is not working correctly.
- The function checks the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, then attempts to compare individual axes and blocks within the BlockManager objects. 
- The error message indicates that even though `self.axes` and `other.axes` have the same values, the comparison fails, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug likely lies in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` despite having identical values, causing the function to return `True` instead of `False`.
- The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a canonical function (`canonicalize`) may not be correctly distinguishing between the two BlockManager objects.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of directly comparing `self.axes` and `other.axes`, use a different approach to ensure that the comparison yields the correct result. 
- Ensure that the sorting based on the canonical function can effectively distinguish between the blocks within each BlockManager object.

### Corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False

    # Check if each axis is equal
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if each block is equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly compare the axes and blocks within both BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal.
