### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. However, the current implementation has a bug where it compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects using a sorting mechanism that may not correctly handle cases where the data types are mismatched. This bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to the failing test case.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the sorting mechanism used in the `canonicalize` function, where it sorts blocks based on the combination of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. If the data types of the blocks are different between the two BlockManagers being compared, this sorting may not accurately match the blocks, leading to false positive or negative results. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for differences in data types appropriately. One way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into consideration the data type of the blocks when creating the sorting key. This modification should help ensure a more accurate comparison between the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_key = block.values.dtype.name if len(block.values) > 0 else None
        return (dtype_key, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we modified the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the block values in the sorting key. This modification ensures that blocks are sorted based on both data type and location, which should lead to a more accurate comparison between BlockManager objects.
