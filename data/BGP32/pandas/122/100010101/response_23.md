### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The error message is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` is `True`, which is incorrect.

### Error
The error occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` function. It fails to handle the comparison of data within the blocks of the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the comparison is done correctly for all attributes and blocks within the `BlockManager`. 
2. Update the comparison logic to appropriately handle the data comparison within the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block1 = self_blocks[i]
        block2 = other_blocks[i]

        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By iterating over each block within the `BlockManager`, sorting them by a canonical representation, and comparing them individually, we ensure a correct comparison is made.
