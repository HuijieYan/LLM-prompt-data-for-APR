### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the comparison logic within the function is flawed, leading to incorrect results. The issue arises when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, as the comparison is based on sorting the blocks using a canonicalization function. This can cause blocks to be compared incorrectly, resulting in a mismatch issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to adjust the block comparison logic. Instead of relying on sorting the blocks based on a canonicalized form, we should directly compare the blocks to ensure accurate equality checking.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version of the `equals` function, we ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` objects is accurate and will return the correct equality result. After making this change, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
