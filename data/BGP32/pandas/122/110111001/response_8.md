### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises from the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks before comparison.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different values, and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` function. The assertion fails, indicating that the function is not handling the comparison correctly.

### Bug
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to how the blocks are sorted before comparison. The function sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function which combines the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of the block. If there are unconsolidated blocks, i.e., blocks of different types that can only be distinguished by the iteration order, they might be incorrectly sorted.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly for comparison. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on their content rather than relying solely on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the values within the blocks while still considering their types.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks based on their content values, we ensure a more accurate comparison between the `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
