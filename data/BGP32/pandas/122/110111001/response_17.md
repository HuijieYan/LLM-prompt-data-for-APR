### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The two DataFrames have columns `a` and `b`, but the values in these columns are swapped between the two DataFrames. The comparison within the `equals` method fails to account for the columns being swapped, resulting in a False assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class so that it correctly handles the comparison of blocks in the DataFrames even when the column order is different. One way to tackle this issue is to sort the blocks based on a combination of the column dtype and location information. By ensuring consistent sorting, we can compare the blocks irrespective of the column order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining column dtype and block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a combination of dtype and location in the corrected version, we ensure that the comparison takes into account the column content and order. This change should address the issue observed in the failing test and allow the comparison to correctly determine the equality of the DataFrames.
