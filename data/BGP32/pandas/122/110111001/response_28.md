### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if one `BlockManager` is equal to another by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test is due to incorrect handling of the comparison.
2. The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates the blocks in place before comparing the blocks. However, the comparison of blocks is erroneous.
3. The error occurs because the function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks without considering the block content.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual content of the blocks while considering their respective data types and values.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

### Updated and Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype or not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing both the data type and values of the blocks, the corrected function will properly check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. This should resolve the failing test case.
