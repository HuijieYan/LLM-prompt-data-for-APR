### Analysis and Explanation:
- The `equals` function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects. In the failing test, two `DataFrame` objects are being compared using the `equals` function, which internally compares the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` objects.
- The failing test shows that two `DataFrame` objects have different values for columns 'a' and 'b' in different orders:
    - `df1`: {'a': [1, 2], 'b': ['s', 'd']}
    - `df2`: {'a': ['s', 'd'], 'b': [1, 2]}
- The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the fact that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not handling the case where the blocks are of the same data type but have different orderings. 
- The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on data type and locs, which is not sufficient to handle the case where the block ordering is different but the contents are the same.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider the actual data within the blocks rather than just the data type and locations.
- We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual data in the comparison.
- Additionally, we can compare the values within the blocks directly to check for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly taking order into account
    return all((block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the comparison will properly handle the case where the blocks have the same data but are ordered differently, leading to a correct evaluation of equality.
