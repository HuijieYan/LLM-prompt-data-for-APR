### Analysis
The function `equals` is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is incorrect.

### Bug
The bug lies in how the blocks within the `BlockManager` are compared. The function is sorting the blocks in the `BlockManager` using a `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs`. However, the comparison of blocks is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparisons between corresponding blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are done correctly. We should compare the data within the blocks, rather than just comparing the blocks themselves.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in the BlockManager
    for block_name in self.blocks:
        self_block = self.blocks[block_name]
        other_block = other.blocks.get(block_name)
        
        if other_block is None or not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over each block in the `BlockManager` and comparing the corresponding blocks in the `other` instance, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly at a block level. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
