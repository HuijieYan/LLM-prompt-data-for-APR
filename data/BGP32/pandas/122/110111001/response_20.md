### Analysis:
The `equals` function is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` with columns in a different order and expects them to be unequal. However, the current `equals` function does not handle the case where the columns are in a different order, leading to the failing assertion.

### Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. If the blocks are consolidated in different order within the two instances, the comparison is done based on the order of consolidation, not the logical order of columns.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in a way that takes into consideration the logical order of columns, rather than the consolidation order. One approach is to sort the blocks based on the column names before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_key(block):
        return tuple(block.items)

    # Sort blocks based on logical column order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on the logical order of columns before comparing them, resolving the issue with column order affecting the equality check. Now, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass when using this corrected version of the `equals` function.
