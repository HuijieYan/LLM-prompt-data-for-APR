### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The bug occurs because during comparison, the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the block's type and locations for distinguishing between different blocks. This leads to incorrect sorting and equality checks between the blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly represents the block by combining its type name and manager locations. This will help in distinguishing between different blocks during sorting and comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, combining type name and mgr_locs for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are correctly compared and sorted based on their type name and manager locations, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
