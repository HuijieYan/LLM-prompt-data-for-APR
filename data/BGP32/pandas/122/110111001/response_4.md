### Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The failing test is trying to check if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method but it fails with an `AssertionError`.

#### Bugs identified:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` method is incorrect. It compares the axes first and then sorts and compares blocks. However, the blocks are not correctly handled leading to incorrect comparison results.
2. The `canonicalize` function attempts to sort the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`, but this sorting might not be suitable for correct comparison.

#### Bug cause:
The buggy function fails to handle the block comparison correctly. It sorts the blocks based on certain criteria which may not be sufficient for a correct comparison, leading to the incorrect equality check.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of trying to sort and compare blocks, a better approach might be to iterate over each block in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and directly compare them without trying to sort. This ensures that each block is compared correctly.
2. We should remove the `canonicalize` function and the sorting based on this function, as it might not be suitable for the equality comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we directly iterate over each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and compare them, ensuring a correct equality check without unnecessary sorting.
