### Analysis
- The `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have columns with different data types.
- The error message indicates that the equality check is failing, causing the assertion error.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class assumes that the blocks contained within it will be in the same order, without considering the possibility of data types being different.
- In the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have columns with data of different types, causing the equality check to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function in the `BlockManager` class to handle cases where the data types are different. We should sort the blocks based on both the data type and the `mgr_locs` (location of the blocks) to ensure consistent comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `equals()` function should be able to handle cases where the data types differ between the blocks, ensuring that the equality check is performed correctly.
