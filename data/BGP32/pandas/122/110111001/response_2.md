### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function fails because it checks if the block's data types are equal (`block.dtype.name`) when comparing the blocks. However, this comparison is incorrect because the dtype may not fully represent the block's content. 

When the function tries to sort the blocks, it may not order them correctly since the dtype names are used for sorting. This leads to incorrect results in the equality check between the blocks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. Instead of relying only on `block.dtype.name`, we should consider the actual content of the blocks. We can achieve this by combining the block's data type and the block's values for the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will consider the actual values within the blocks for sorting and comparison, leading to a more accurate equality check.
