The issue in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to stem from how the comparison between blocks is being done. The method attempts to sort the blocks based on both dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the implementation might be inaccurate or incomplete.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the blocks in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances but doesn't handle the case where the block counts in `self` and `other` are different, leading to incorrect comparison and failing the equality check in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles cases where the block counts are different in the two `BlockManager` instances. We should modify the comparison logic to consider all blocks present in both instances when checking for equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = set(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = set(other.blocks)
    
    if self_blocks != other_blocks:
        return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that it correctly compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and handles cases where the block counts are different. By converting the blocks into sets and comparing them, we can accurately determine if the two instances are equal.
