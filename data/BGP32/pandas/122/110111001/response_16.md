### Explanation
The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is comparing the equality of two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes of both instances are equal, then consolidates them and compares the blocks within each instance. However, the comparison of the blocks is done by sorting them based on their dtype and locations. This sorting is causing the comparison to be incorrect, leading to the failing test.

The failing test is checking the equality of two DataFrames, where the columns have different data types. Since the comparison is based on dtype and locations, it fails to detect the actual difference in data, resulting in the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than dtype and locations. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to return a unique identifier based on the block's values, and then comparing the blocks using this identifier.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a hash value of the block's values as a unique identifier
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equality check of blocks will be based on their content rather than dtype and locations, correctly identifying the difference in the failing test case.
