### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the order of blocks while comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`, but due to the inconsistent order of these blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the comparison fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted consistently before comparison. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on a combination of data type name and `mgr_locs` while ignoring the order of insertion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances by consistently ordering the blocks for comparison.
