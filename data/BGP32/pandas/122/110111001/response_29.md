### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of pandas is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates them in place, then compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances after sorting them.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs during the comparison of `BlockManager` instances when different data types are present in the blocks. The bug is related to the sorting and comparison logic for blocks. In the failing test, two `DataFrame` objects are created with columns of different data types and then compared using `.equals()`, which triggers the bug as the order of the columns is different between the two frames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the canonicalization of blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks by dtype name, we can sort them by column names to ensure that the comparison is consistent irrespective of the column data types.

### Updated `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.items)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on column names, we ensure that the comparison is done consistently and the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
