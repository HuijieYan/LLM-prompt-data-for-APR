### Explanations
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and if all their blocks are equal. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

In the failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are created with different values in their columns. The test then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating that the dataframes are not equal.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of variables within the buggy function, we see that the comparison process is not reliable due to incorrect handling of block sorting and comparison. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization process, which may lead to blocks being matched incorrectly.

### Bugs
1. The function does not handle block comparison correctly, leading to inconsistent results.
2. Sorting and canonicalization method for blocks may not differentiate between blocks with different content.
3. The comparison logic for axes can be improved.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is correctly implemented. We should focus on comparing the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and ensuring that they are matched correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare individual blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We perform a block-wise comparison between the blocks in `self` and `other`.
- If any block is found to be unequal, we immediately return `False`.
- If all blocks are equal, we return `True` indicating that the `BlockManager` objects are equal.
