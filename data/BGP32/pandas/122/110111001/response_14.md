### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self.axes` and `other.axes`. The function assumes that comparing the axis labels directly will determine if two BlockManagers are equal, but this is not the correct approach. The comparison logic needs to be updated to consider the values within the blocks for accurate equality comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly compare the block values within the BlockManagers instead of just comparing the axes labels.
2. Adjust the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on block values to ensure proper comparison.
3. Use a comprehensive and consistent method to identify and compare the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to return `block.values` and performing comparison based on the values of the blocks, this corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately determine equality between two BlockManagers.
