### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to sort both blocks based on a custom comparison key created by the `canonicalize` function. However, the comparison key generated by `canonicalize` includes `mgr_locs`, which is causing the comparison to be incorrect if the ordering of `mgr_locs` is different between the blocks.

In the failing test case provided, the DataFrame `df1` and `df2` have their column values swapped. When the `equals` function is called to compare them, the function fails to detect that the DataFrames are not equal due to the mismatching arbitrary order of `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use only the `dtype.name` for comparisons since comparing `mgr_locs` (which is an internal representation) between blocks is unnecessary and causes incorrect results.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to only consider the `dtype.name` of the block for comparison, we address the bug related to the incorrect block ordering comparison. This corrected version should now provide the expected results and pass the failing test case.
