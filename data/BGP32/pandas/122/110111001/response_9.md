### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes, number of blocks, and actual blocks are equal. However, the bug is caused by the way the function handles the comparison of blocks. It does not properly compare the content of each block and instead just compares them based on their data type and memory locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug:
The `equals` function is not comparing the content of blocks correctly, causing it to return incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `equals` function to compare the content of each block instead of just their data types and memory locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block content
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By comparing the content of each block in the `BlockManager`, the corrected version should now correctly check for the equality of two instances.
