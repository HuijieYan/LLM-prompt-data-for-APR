### Analysis
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and expects them to be unequal, which is accurate. However, the current implementation of the `equals` function does not handle this case correctly, leading to a false positive result.

The issue arises from the sorting of blocks based on the block dtype name and mgr_locs. Since the dtype name is obtained only from the first block, if the blocks have different dtypes but the same block mgr_locs, they could be erroneously considered equal.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing case, the two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` have blocks with different dtypes but the same mgr_locs due to the columns being reversed in one DataFrame. The sorting based solely on the first block's dtype causes the mismatch to be overlooked, resulting in an incorrect equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we should enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype and the mgr_locs of the blocks for comparison. By incorporating the dtype and mgr_locs from each block into the canonicalization process, we can ensure that blocks with different dtypes are not falsely identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the mgr_locs in the ordering, we ensure that blocks with different dtypes but the same logical position are correctly distinguished. This correction should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
