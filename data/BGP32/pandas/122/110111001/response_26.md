### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The current implementation is failing the test because it is not comparing the blocks correctly due to the sorting based on an incorrect key in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function, where the sorting key created by combining the dtype name and mgr_locs may not correctly represent the uniqueness of the blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to come up with a better sorting key that properly reflects the uniqueness of the blocks. One approach is to iterate over the block itself and combine all relevant information for comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        block_info = ''
        for elem in block.iter_simple():
            block_info += str(elem)
        return block_info

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By iterating over the block elements directly in the `canonicalize` function, we can generate a sorting key that more accurately represents the content of the blocks for comparison. This should address the bug and make the `equals` method function correctly.
