### Potential Error Location
The error in the `equals` function may be due to the comparison of blocks in different order which causes the function to return `True` incorrectly. The sorting of blocks based on a custom key may be causing the discrepancy.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b`, swapping the data types between them. The test then asserts that the `equals` function should return `False` since the DataFrames are not equal.

However, due to a bug in the `equals` function, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. This occurs because the block sorting within the function does not account for the differing data types in the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. Rather than only considering the data type name (dtype name), we should also consider the type of block (IntBlock, ObjectBlock, etc.) to ensure correct comparison between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Improved canonicalization function considering block type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying the fix above, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on both the data type name and the block type, ensuring the correct comparison result between DataFrames with different data types.
