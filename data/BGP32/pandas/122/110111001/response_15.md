### Bug Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be caused by inconsistent handling of axis comparison and block comparison.

1. The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` and `other` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
2. Then, it compares each axis element-wise using a generator expression. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
3. Consolidation of axes is performed in-place for both `self` and `other`.
4. After that, the function compares the number of blocks in `self` and `other`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
5. The blocks in each `BlockManager` instance are sorted using a custom key function, which combines the block data type name and `mgr_locs` attribute to ensure consistent ordering for comparison.
6. Finally, the function iterates over each pair of blocks in `self` and `other`, comparing them. If any pair of blocks are not equal, it returns `False`.

The bug occurs because during the block sorting process, the `block` variable is used without proper handling of its internal attributes. This leads to incorrect block comparison, causing the `equals` function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the `block` objects. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function should extract the necessary information from each block object for consistent ordering and comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
      
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function extracts the necessary information from each block object, including the block type name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring consistent block sorting for comparison. This fix should address the issue observed in the failing test case and provide the expected behavior for the `equals` function.
