### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager`, checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` list and `other_blocks` list. The comparison is done using the `equals` method of the blocks, which fails for blocks that contain different data types in this context.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared appropriately. One way to achieve this is to compare the block data directly instead of relying on the `equals` method, which may not handle the comparison of heterogeneous data types correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs).all()
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the block values directly using `(block.values == oblock.values).all()` and the block locations using `(block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs).all()` to ensure accurate comparison regardless of the data type. This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
