### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug occurs due to incorrectly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic sorts the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations, which might lead to incorrect comparisons, especially when the blocks are unconsolidated.

The error message in the failing test indicates that the comparison result is `True` when it should be `False`, leading to an assertion error. This is likely because the block comparison logic is not correctly handling the situation where the blocks are not consolidated or are arranged in a different order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to enhance the block comparison logic to ensure accurate comparison of blocks even when they are unconsolidated or in a different order. One approach is to compare the blocks based on their content rather than the dtype and manager locations alone. This will provide a more robust comparison mechanism for the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, we compare the block values directly rather than sorting the blocks based on dtype and manager locations. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, leading to a correct evaluation of equality.
