### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on the sorted order of the blocks, where each block is expected to be equal to its corresponding block in the other instance. However, the bug occurs because the sorting order is based on the result of the `canonicalize` function, which combines the data type name (`block.dtype.name`) and the locations (`block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`) of the blocks. 

The bug manifests when comparing `df1` and `df2` DataFrames in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` due to the mismatch in the block order, causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when it should be `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to revise how the blocks are sorted and compared. Instead of depending on the `canonicalize` function, we should directly compare the blocks by iterating over them and checking for equality without changing their order. This way, identical blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` will be correctly recognized as equal, leading to the function returning `True` when the two instances match.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, correctly identifying that `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are not equal.
