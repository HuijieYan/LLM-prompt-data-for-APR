### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting creates a tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. However, in the runtime values provided, `block.dtype.name` is of type `dtype` and cannot be directly compared. This leads to a failure in comparing blocks and results in the function returning incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the `dtype` object appropriately and create a comparable tuple for sorting.

### Corrected Version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    # which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting `block.dtype` to a string before creating the tuple, we ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a comparable tuple for sorting. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
