### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the function tries to compare blocks in different orderings without properly considering the data inside the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and memory locations but does not ensure that the actual data within the blocks match. This leads to incorrect comparison results, causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the data within the blocks for a more accurate comparison. We can achieve this by comparing the data contained within the blocks in addition to their type name and memory locations. By considering the data itself, we can ensure that the blocks are truly equal, not just based on type and memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes the block data (`block.values.tolist()`) in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring a proper comparison between blocks based on both metadata and actual data. This modification should address the bug and pass the failing test.
