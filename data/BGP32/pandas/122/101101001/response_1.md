### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The issue arises from the way the blocks are being sorted before comparison. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple to represent each block, consisting of the dtype name and the manager locations. However, when converting `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, there is a mistake as `as_array` is not supposed to be called as a method. This causes the comparison to fail due to a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way `mgr_locs` is accessed, ensuring that it is correctly used in the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

By using `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function, we avoid the TypeError that was occurring due to the incorrect usage of `as_array`. This correction should enable the function to pass the failing test.
