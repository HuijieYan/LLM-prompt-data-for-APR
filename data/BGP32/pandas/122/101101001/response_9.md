### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the sorting mechanism used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting is based on the result of the `canonicalize` function, which compares the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` value of each block. However, the comparison of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` could lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to modify the sorting key in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the comparison is done properly. We should aim to compare `mgr_locs.as_array` directly rather than converting it to a list, which may cause discrepancies. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After making these changes, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array` values without causing any discrepancies, fixing the bug identified by the failing test.
