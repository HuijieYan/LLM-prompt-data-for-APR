### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare blocks is incorrectly comparing the dtype name and the mgr_locs of the blocks. In the failing test case, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have different data types in corresponding columns which causes the bug to be triggered.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to compare only the values within the blocks themselves without considering the dtype name and mgr_locs. This way, the comparison will focus on the actual data within the blocks rather than their attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will focus on comparing the actual values within the blocks, ensuring that the comparison is done based on the data content rather than block attributes.
