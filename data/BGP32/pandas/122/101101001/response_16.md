### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a custom key `canonicalize`. The issue is that the `canonicalize` function compares the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block, which is of type `BlockPlacement`. This comparison is not appropriate for equality testing, as the `BlockPlacement` instance may not have a well-defined equality comparison method implemented.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the custom key used for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should not rely on comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute directly. A better approach would involve using a key that is directly associated with the data values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a more suitable key for comparison, e.g., combining dtype and values
        return (type(block), block._try_coerce_and_cast_result())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a more suitable key for comparison, which combines the block's type and its coerced and casted values. This change ensures that the comparison for equality checking is based on more relevant data characteristics.
