The bug in the provided function seems to stem from the fact that the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done using a custom key function `canonicalize`, which combines the type name and the location of the blocks for comparison. However, the `mgr_locs` are returned as a list due to the `.as_array.tolist()` call in the `canonicalize` function, which leads to incorrect sorting and subsequent comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` are converted to a tuple before being used for sorting and comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting `mgr_locs.as_array` to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function, the sorting and subsequent comparison will be done correctly. This correction should resolve the failing test case provided.
