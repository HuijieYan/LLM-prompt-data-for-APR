### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from the way the blocks are being compared for equality. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function that considers the block's data type and location. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is using the `as_array` method incorrectly, resulting in incorrect sorting of blocks and failing the equality check as observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function should correctly convert `mgr_locs` to a list for sorting blocks. By updating the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` within the `canonicalize` function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should return the correct equality comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test case should now pass without any issues.
