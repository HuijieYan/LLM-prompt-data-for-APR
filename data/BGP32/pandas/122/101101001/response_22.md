### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function compares the blocks in the `self_blocks` list and the `other_blocks` list using the `equals` method, which may not be accurate if the blocks are not in the same order. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` function creates a consistent order for comparison. However, the issue is that the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of (`dtype.name`, `mgr_locs`), where `mgr_locs` is an object of the `BlockPlacement` class. Comparing the `mgr_locs` based on `as_array.tolist()` may not give meaningful results for comparison purposes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to extract essential information for comparing blocks. The modified function should consider `dtype` for data type comparison and potentially other block attributes that are relevant for equality comparison. By ensuring that the sorting logic in `canonicalize` accurately captures the identity of each block, we can make the comparison more reliable.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.shape, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include essential attributes like `dtype`, `shape`, and `values` for comparison, the corrected version of the function should now accurately compare the blocks and resolve the bug.
