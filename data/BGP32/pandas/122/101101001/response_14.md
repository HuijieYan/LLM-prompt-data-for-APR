### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug arises due to the order of the blocks not being consistent between the two objects. The sorting of the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` is causing the issue because it may not always ensure a consistent order.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `canonicalize` function that sorts blocks is not guaranteed to produce the same order for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects since the sorting is based on block properties rather than a unique identifier common between both objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to redefine the sorting mechanism in a way that guarantees consistent block order between the two `BlockManager` objects being compared.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(idx, block) for idx, block in enumerate(self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [(idx, block) for idx, block in enumerate(other.blocks)]

    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1].values, x[0]))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1].values, x[0]))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for (_, block), (_, oblock) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the above correction, we keep track of the block index along with the block and sort them based on the block values and index to ensure consistent order while comparing the blocks. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave correctly.
