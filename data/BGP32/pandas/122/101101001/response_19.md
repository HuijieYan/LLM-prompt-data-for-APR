### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The issue arises from the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting is incorrectly considering `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to be the key for sorting. The `mgr_locs` attribute is likely causing the sorting to fail as it might not have a deterministic order.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more reliable criterion for sorting blocks. We can use a combination of block data type and block values as the key for sorting instead of `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the corrected `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on data type and values, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` will be more accurate, resolving the bug.
