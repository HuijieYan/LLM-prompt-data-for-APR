### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, the current implementation fails to properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug arises when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is supposed to determine block equality based on the block's data type and manager locations. The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method does not consider the case where blocks may contain different data types (e.g., int vs. object) but still hold equal values. This leads to incorrect comparison results and causes the failing test due to a false negative equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and address the failing test case, we need to modify the block comparison logic within the `equals` function. Instead of solely relying on block data types, we should compare the actual block values for equality. This adjustment will ensure that blocks with different data types but equal values are considered equal during the comparison.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(sel_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly using the `equals` method, we ensure that even blocks with different data types but equal values are considered equal during the comparison, addressing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
