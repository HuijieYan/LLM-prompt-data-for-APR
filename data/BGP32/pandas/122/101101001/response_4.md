### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
- The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly extracting the necessary information to properly sort the blocks.
- The `canonicalize` function should return a unique tuple for each block to ensure correct sorting.
- In the given test case, the blocks are not being properly sorted before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the necessary attributes that distinguish blocks uniquely.
2. Sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the updated `canonicalize` function before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include unique attributes to distinguish blocks
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the `canonicalize` function creates unique tuples for each block and sorting the blocks based on these tuples before comparison, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
