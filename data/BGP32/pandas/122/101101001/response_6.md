### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The function tries to sort and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances based on their types and `mgr_locs` properties. In the failing test case, the comparison fails due to the mismatch in the block order between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism for blocks to ensure consistency for comparison. Instead of solely relying on the `canonicalize` function for sorting, we should consider integrating a more robust method to sort and compare the blocks accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by type and length for consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: (type(b), len(b)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: (type(b), len(b))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on both type and length, we ensure a consistent ordering for comparison, addressing the bug in the original function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
