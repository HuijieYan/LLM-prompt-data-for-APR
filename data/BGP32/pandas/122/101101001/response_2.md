### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is designed to check for equality between two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the function because it fails to properly consolidate the blocks before comparing them. As a result, blocks may not be in the correct order, leading to false inequalities even when the underlying data is the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are consolidated and sorted before comparing them. By consolidating the blocks, we enforce a common block structure that allows for accurate comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

Applying the consolidation step before sorting the blocks should address the bug and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test.
