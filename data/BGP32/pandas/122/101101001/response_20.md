### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is due to the inconsistent ordering of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` when comparing them. The function sorts the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function, which uses the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes of a block to determine the order. However, the existing implementation does not handle the case where `mgr_locs` is not of the same type for different blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function in a way that accommodates different types of `mgr_locs` for the blocks. One approach could be to convert `mgr_locs` attribute to a standardized string representation for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype and converted mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_locs_str = str(block.mgr_locs)
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs_str)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use a string representation of `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now handle blocks with different `mgr_locs` types and pass the failing test provided.
