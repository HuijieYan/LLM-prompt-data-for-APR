### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class as it compares two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The issue arises due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

In the case provided, the input parameters of the buggy function show that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples containing references to blocks in a `BlockManager` object. Since the blocks are not directly comparable, the comparison logic fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we need to compare their contents or attributes to determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block[0].equals(oblock[0]) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we compare the values inside the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` instead of directly comparing block objects. This approach ensures that the comparison is meaningful and accurate, addressing the bug in the original function.
