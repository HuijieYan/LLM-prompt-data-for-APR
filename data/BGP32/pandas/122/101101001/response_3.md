### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` class. The bug arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by sorting them based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and block locations for each block.

However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is using the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which is not a valid attribute. This is causing an AttributeError since `mgr_locs` is expected to be a list, but the original code treats it as an attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the required information for sorting the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making this correction in the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs.tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, the bug should be fixed, and the function should be able to pass the failing test.
