### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts these blocks based on a canonicalize function that creates a tuple containing the block dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not accessible directly from a Block object, leading to an AttributeError and causing the function to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to extract the relevant information from the blocks correctly. This involves accessing the block's dtype name and the locations to compare the blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function incorporating the necessary changes:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in the BlockManager objects and the failing test case should pass.
