### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two BlockManagers for equality. However, the bug arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize()` function, which is using `mgr_locs()` incorrectly. The `mgr_locs` attribute of a block indicates the placement of that block within the BlockManager, not the actual block data, so using `mgr_locs` to compare two blocks can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to compare blocks correctly by considering the actual data within each block rather than the placement information. We should use the block's data, such as values or memory locations, instead of `mgr_locs`. This change will ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks within the BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.shape, block.dtype)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize()` function to compare block values, shape, and dtype rather than using `mgr_locs`, the corrected version of the function will now accurately determine the equality of the two BlockManagers. It should now pass the failing test provided.
