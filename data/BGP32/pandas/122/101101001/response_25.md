### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves. However, the bug occurs because the comparison of blocks is not properly implemented. The function tries to compare the blocks by sorting them based on a tuple containing the type name and the locations of the blocks. This approach is flawed because the location might not always be a unique identifier for blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is accurate and consistent. Instead of relying on the locations of the blocks, we can directly compare the contents of each block.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in both `BlockManager` objects to ensure that they are equal.
