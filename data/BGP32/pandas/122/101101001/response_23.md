### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes, blocks, and their contents are equal between the two instances. The bug in the function causes it to fail the equality check even when the actual data frames are different.

The main issues in the buggy function are:
1. The function sorts the blocks based on a certain criteria, but it doesn't consider the actual content of the blocks when comparing.
2. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks is not considering the actual data but only the dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the sorting mechanism used in the function. It sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which does not guarantee that the actual data inside the blocks are equal. This results in cases where two different `BlockManager` instances are incorrectly marked as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data contained in the blocks, not just their type and locations. We should consider the content of the blocks rather than their characteristics for sorting and comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.values.flatten())))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.values.flatten())))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now sorts the blocks based on the content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations. This should fix the bug and make the function correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their actual data.
