### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the inconsistent ordering of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before performing the equality check. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on a tuple combining the block type name and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` is converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. However, `as_array` is not a list directly and is causing the sorting to be incorrect, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the block locations as a list. This can be achieved by directly converting `mgr_locs` to a list without using `as_array.tolist()`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now directly converts `mgr_locs` to a list, ensuring that the block order is consistent and the equality check functions as expected.
