The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class based on their attributes. The bug arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The comparison logic sorts the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attributes, which may result in incorrect ordering for the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison is done correctly by considering the block attributes for equality comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on attributes for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality instead of sorting based on specific attributes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
