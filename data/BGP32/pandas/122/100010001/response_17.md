### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is supposed to compare two internal objects and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed due to unexpected behavior, where the comparison is showing `True is False`.
- The failing test is validating the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have different data types in their columns.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is due to how the equality comparison between the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` is being performed.
- Since the two dataframes have different datatypes in their columns, the current code does not handle this case properly.
- The function `canonicalize` used for sorting does not consider column data types, leading to the unexpected behavior during comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to enhance the `canonicalize` function to consider the column data types along with other properties that are used to sort the blocks.
- Ensure that the sorting function considers all relevant dataframe properties that determine equality.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # enhanced canonicalize function to consider datatype in sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.__dir__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By enhancing the `canonicalize` function to include the datatype of the block, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly, taking into account the column data types. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
