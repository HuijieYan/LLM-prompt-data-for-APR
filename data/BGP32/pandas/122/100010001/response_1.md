### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two objects of a class. The function first compares the axes of the objects and if they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it consolidates the objects and compares the blocks inside them.
- The error message indicates that the comparison between the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` failed.
- The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` resulted in `assert True is False` which implies that the function returned `True` while it was expected to return `False`.

### Potential Errors:
1. The comparison of the blocks inside the objects might not be correct.
2. The sorting of the blocks before comparison could be causing issues.
3. The comparison logic within the loop might not be correct.
4. Data type mismatches within the blocks might lead to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the fact that the comparison logic in the function is relying on the order of blocks after sorting, which may not accurately represent the equality of the two objects. In the case of the test dataframes `df1` and `df2`, even though the column names are different (`a` and `b` positions swapped), the blocks may still have been sorted based on the column names, leading to the mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison logic takes into account the actual data content of the blocks.
2. Implement a proper comparison method that evaluates the data within blocks, considering column positions and data contents.
3. Adjust the sorting logic to sort based on similar content rather than just the block attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_data = [block.to_numpy().tolist() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.to_numpy().tolist() for block in other.blocks]
    
    def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        try:
            row, col = block1.shape
            return row == block2.shape[0] and col == block2.shape[1] and (block1 == block2).all()
        except AttributeError:
            return False
        
    # Compare block data considering both row and column positions
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_block_data, other_block_data)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the block data based on their content rather than just their attributes. It checks for equality based on the shape and values of the blocks, taking into account the row and column positions. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison between the objects.
