### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `equals()` method is not returning the expected result when comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`).
2. The error arises from how the DataFrame columns are being compared.
3. In the buggy function, the issue is likely caused by the comparison of the DataFrames using the `equals()` method, which leads to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the comparison is performed to ensure that comparison is done correctly based on the DataFrame values rather than their memory location or some other attribute.

### Correction:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `equals()` method to compare the actual values within the DataFrames rather than the object references. The corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Ensure the index and columns are equal
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False

    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected version first checks if the index and columns of the two DataFrames are the same. Then, it compares the actual values of the DataFrames using the `equals()` method for their values. This way, the comparison is based on the data values rather than their internal representation.
Ensure that the corrected function is properly integrated into the `managers.py` file in the correct class structure. After making this correction, the failing test should pass successfully.
