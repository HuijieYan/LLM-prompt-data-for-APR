### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas library is expected to compare two objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The error message asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False, but the actual comparison is evaluated to True.

### Error Location:
The issue likely stems from the usage of `.equals` method within the `canonicalize` function that is applied to each individual block. The comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function may not handle the equality comparison as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
When comparing the DataFrame `df1` and `df2`, the bug in the `equals` function causes the `canonicalize` function to not accurately determine the equivalence of the blocks in the DataFrames, leading to the incorrect evaluation of equality.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function determines the equivalence of blocks correctly, reflecting the actual contents in the DataFrame. This can be achieved by cross-referencing and sorting the blocks based on a more comprehensive set of parameters for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, values, and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Combining block values, block dtypes, and block mgr_locs for comparison
        return (block.values, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Verify equality by checking each pair of blocks
    return all(
        sblock.values.equals(oblock.values) and sblock.dtype == oblock.dtype and sblock.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for sblock, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the `values`, `dtype`, and `mgr_locs` of each block, the corrected version ensures that the comparison between blocks in the DataFrames will accurately determine the equality. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the bug.
