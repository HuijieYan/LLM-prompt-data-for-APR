### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two objects and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the comparison between two data frames is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Potential Errors:
1. The `canonicalize` function might not be handling the comparison correctly.
2. Block sorting and comparison logic could be causing unexpected behavior.
3. There might be issues with the way blocks are being compared.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect implementation of block canonicalization and sorting. The sorting mechanism is not ensuring the correct order of blocks to perform the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the block sorting logic and the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks are properly sorted for comparison. Additionally, we need to make sure that the comparison of blocks is accurate and identifies the differences correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a key to sort blocks based on the columns
    def sort_key(block):
        return list(block.items())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the block order in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is consistent based on the columns' order, ensuring accurate comparison of the blocks in the data frames. This should fix the bug and make the function return correct results in comparisons.
