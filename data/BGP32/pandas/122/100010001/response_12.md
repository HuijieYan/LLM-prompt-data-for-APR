### Analysis:
- The failing test is checking if `df1` equals `df2`, where the DataFrames have different data types in their columns.
- The error message shows that the assertion failed because `assert True is False`. This indicates that the equality comparison between `df1` and `df2` returned `True` when it should have been `False`.
- The `equals` method in the buggy function is not checking for data type mismatches between columns when comparing two DataFrames. It simply checks if the lengths and blocks of the DataFrames match.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `equals` method does not explicitly handle comparisons between columns with different data types.
2. When sorting blocks of DataFrames, it uses a canonicalization function that does not consider data type differences.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `equals` method does not account for column data type differences when comparing DataFrames. When calling `df1.equals(df2)`, the method does not consider that the data in column 'a' and 'b' are of different types in `df1` and `df2`, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to check for differences in column data types when comparing DataFrames. This can be achieved by explicitly comparing column names and data types before proceeding with block-wise comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check column names and data types
    for col in self.axes:
        if self[col].dtype != other[col].dtype:
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the corrected `equals` method will now compare data type and column names in addition to the existing checks, ensuring a more thorough and accurate comparison between DataFrames.
