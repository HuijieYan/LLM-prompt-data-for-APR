## Analysis:
The buggy function shown is a method that compares two internal pandas data structures (`self` and `other`) based on their axes, blocks, and block attributes. The error message resulting from the failing test indicates that the equality check between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method returns `True` instead of `False` as expected.

## Issue:
The issue in the buggy function arises from the way the DataFrame blocks are compared. When sorting the blocks of each DataFrame by their data type and `mgr_locs`, the equality check may fail if the columns in the DataFrames are not corresponding according to their position.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison is done correctly. One way to fix this issue is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both the type and the position of the columns when sorting the blocks.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Check if the axes of both DataFrames are equal
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both DataFrames inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks in both DataFrames are equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a canonicalize function to sort blocks based on dtype and position
    def canonicalize(block, id):
        return (block._type, id)
    
    self_blocks = list(enumerate(self.blocks))
    other_blocks = list(enumerate(other.blocks))
    
    # Sort blocks based on dtype and identifier
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[1], x[0]))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Compare each block of the two DataFrames
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (_, block), (_, oblock) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the canonicalize function to include the identifier of each block, we ensure that the comparison is accurate based on the dtype and position of the columns. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the `equals` method to correctly compare the two DataFrames.
