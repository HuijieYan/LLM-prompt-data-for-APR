### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares whether two internal data structures are equal or not, but the current implementation is not handling data types correctly, resulting in a misleading comparison.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `.equals()` method failed with the unexpected result "assert True is False".
3. The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the data types in the comparison process. The DataFrames have different data types for columns `a` and `b`, leading to the erroneous comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the data types of the blocks in the DataFrames for a proper comparison.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use the block.values data instead of dtype name for comparison
        return str(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the correction, the function now compares the data values of the blocks in the DataFrames, ensuring a proper comparison based on the content rather than data types. This correction should resolve the issue with the failing test case.
