### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is not comparing the data correctly within DataFrames when their column data types are different. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of self and other axes.
2. Comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `equals()` is comparing blocks by sorting them based on the block's dtype name and manager locations. However, it fails to consider the case where the columns have different data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the columns are compared based on their actual values, not just their types.
2. Implement a comprehensive check to compare the column values for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_col, other_col in self, other:
        if not self_col.equals(other_col):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each column in both DataFrames and compare their values. This way, we ensure that the function correctly evaluates equality based on the column values rather than just their dtype names.
