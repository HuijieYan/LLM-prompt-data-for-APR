The error message indicates that the test assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, showing that the comparison of two dataframes using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method in the buggy function is not working correctly.

The issue with the buggy function is that it is comparing the blocks within the dataframes but not considering the column order. To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks to include the column order as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including column order as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.columns.tolist(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the corrected `canonicalize` function includes the column order in addition to the block's data type and locations, ensuring the correct comparison between dataframes. This should fix the bug and make the test pass successfully.
