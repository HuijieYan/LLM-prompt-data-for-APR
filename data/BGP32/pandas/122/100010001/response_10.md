### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` which is trying to compare two instances to check if they are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False. This mismatch in return value is causing the assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the mismatch between the data in `df1` and `df2`. The columns in the data frames are inconsistent, which is why the comparison is failing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing the data frames correctly by considering column names and values in the correct order.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if set(self.columns) != set(other.columns):
        return False
    return self.reindex(columns=sorted(self.columns)).equals(other.reindex(columns=sorted(other.columns)))
```

In this corrected version:
- The function first checks if the column names of the two data frames are equal using `set(self.columns) != set(other.columns)`.
- Then, it ensures that the data is correctly ordered by reindexing both data frames based on sorted column names before performing the comparison.
- Finally, it checks if the reindexed data frames are equal using the `equals` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
