### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file for the `pandas` library is intended to compare two internal data structures. The error message indicates that the expectation that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False` is not met.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function could be causing the mismatch.
2. The comparison of individual blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` might not be handling the data types correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the fact that when comparing DataFrames `df1.equals(df2)`, the function is comparing elements of the columns but not the actual values. This leads to the incorrect behavior where `True` is returned when it should ideally be `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual data values in the DataFrames rather than just comparing the internal structures.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check if the number of blocks is different
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Iterate through blocks and compare values rather than element-wise
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

By using the corrected version of the `equals` function which compares the actual values in the blocks of the DataFrames, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass with the expected output.
