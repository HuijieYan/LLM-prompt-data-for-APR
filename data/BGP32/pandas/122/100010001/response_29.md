### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `equals`, is supposed to compare two DataFrames based on their axes, blocks, and data.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the function is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different data values well.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the blocks of two DataFrames is based on the DataFrame values and not just their order.
5. We will adjust the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values in the blocks when sorting.

### Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to consider block values instead of just their type names, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly compare two DataFrames. This change ensures that the comparison accounts for the actual data content of the blocks.
