### Analysis:
The buggy function, `equals`, is supposed to compare two InternalBlocks for equality by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing the blocks based on a canonicalized order. The error message is indicating that the test failed with an assertion error. The failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, is comparing two DataFrames that have different values for columns 'a' and 'b', yet it erroneously returned True instead of False.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the function.
2. The canonicalization of blocks might not work properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function. It first checks if the axes are equal, which is likely to pass since the DataFrames might have the same structure. However, when it comes to comparing the actual block data, the function sorts the blocks based on their type and manager locations, which cannot correctly compare DataFrames with different values in the same columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic directly compares the data within the blocks without relying on the sorting mechanism. We need to focus on comparing the actual values for equality instead of trying to sort the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare the blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the DataFrames for equality without the sorting logic, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
