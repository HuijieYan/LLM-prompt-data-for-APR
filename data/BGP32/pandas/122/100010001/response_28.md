The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing an error when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, which implies that the comparison between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` was expected to be `False` but resulted in `True`.

### Error Analysis:
1. The function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks within the DataFrames for comparison. The sorting is based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, aiming to handle unconsolidated blocks. However, the bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, which does not handle columns with different types effectively.
2. When comparing DataFrames that have columns with different types in different orderings (like in the failing test), the sorting logic in `canonicalize` fails to correctly handle these cases, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to consider a better strategy to ensure that the comparison of DataFrames works correctly even when the columns have different types or are in different orders. One possible approach is to sort the DataFrame columns before generating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function. This way, columns with different names but matching types would be compared correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(df):
        sorted_columns = df.columns.sort_values()
        return tuple(
            (df[col].dtype.name, df[col].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
            for col in sorted_columns
        )

    self_blocks = sorted((df[col] for col in self.columns), key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    other_blocks = sorted((df[col] for col in other.columns), key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the columns before generating the tuple in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison of DataFrames in the `equals` method considers columns with different types but matching names correctly. This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
