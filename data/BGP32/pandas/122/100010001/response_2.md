### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `equals` method is incorrectly reporting `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This issue is likely because the comparison involves sorting DataFrames based on data type and location, which might not be the correct approach for determining DataFrame equality.

### Error Location:
The error is most likely caused by the way the DataFrames are being sorted and compared in the `equals` function.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is sorting the blocks of DataFrames based on data type and location, which is impacting the comparison result. This sorting can lead to incorrect assessments of DataFrames' equality, resulting in a faulty output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should refactor the `equals` method to compare the DataFrames directly based on their values rather than sorting blocks based on data type and location. This approach will provide a more accurate assessment of DataFrame equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns) or len(self.index) != len(other.index):
        return False
    
    # Check if column and index labels are the same
    if not all(self.columns == other.columns) or not all(self.index == other.index):
        return False
    
    # Check if the values are the same
    return all((self[col] == other[col]).all().all() for col in self.columns)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the column and index labels are the same. Then, we directly compare the values of DataFrames column-wise to ensure that the DataFrames are equal based on their content.

This corrected version should address the bug and accurately determine DataFrame equality, passing the failing test.
