## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare the equality of two objects. 
The error message specifically mentions that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

## Bug Location:
The bug most likely lies in the way the equality comparison is being performed on the `DataFrame` objects.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug comes from incorrect implementation of the `equals` method. The method should correctly compare the data within the `DataFrame` objects and return `False` if they are not equal, but it is returning `True` instead. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is properly implemented to handle the comparison of `DataFrame` objects correctly. Specifically, we have to compare the values within the dataframes and not just the objects themselves.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns) or any(self.columns != other.columns):
        return False
    if len(self.index) != len(other.index) or any(self.index != other.index):
        return False
    if not np.array_equal(self.values, other.values):
        return False
    return True
```

In this corrected version:
- Check if the number of columns and indexes are equal.
- Check if all the column and index names are equal.
- Compare the values within the dataframes using `np.array_equal`.

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test provided above.
