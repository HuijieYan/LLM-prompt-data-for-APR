The error message indicates that the `equals()` method, when called on two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`), is returning True when it should be returning False. This suggests that there is a problem with the implementation of the `equals()` function in the code.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `equals`, the issue arises due to the implementation of the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name` which is the data type name of the block and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which represents the location of the block. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where the DataFrame columns are in a different order.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to sort the columns of each block of the DataFrame based on column names before calling the `canonicalize` function. This will ensure that the order of columns in the DataFrame is taken into account when checking for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort columns of the block by column name to handle differing column orders
        sorted_columns = sorted(block.columns)
        sorted_block = block[sorted_columns]
        return (sorted_block.dtypes, sorted_block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` function will properly compare two DataFrames, taking into account differences in column orders, and return the correct result. This should fix the bug causing the failing test scenario.
