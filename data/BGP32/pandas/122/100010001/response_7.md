The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other` to check if they are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and dtype. The function seems to be comparing the values incorrectly, leading to a failing test.

The error message shows that the comparison between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` failed and returned `True` instead of `False`. This indicates that the `equals` function is providing incorrect equality comparison.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic of the `equals` function so that it correctly compares the values within the DataFrames rather than just comparing object references.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all([self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]) for i in range(len(self_axes))]):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())))

    return all([self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))])
```

This corrected version compares each element in the axes and blocks of the DataFrames individually to ensure equality. It sorts the blocks based on dtype and location to handle unconsolidated blocks, preventing incorrect ordering during comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
