### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` statement is failing. The function `equals` is supposed to compare two DataFrame objects and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `equals` function implementation provided. Specifically, the `equals` function compares the axes of two DataFrames and then the blocks within the DataFrames. 

### Cause of Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the way the `canonicalize` function is used to order and compare blocks. The discrepancy in values causing the error is due to how the sorting and comparison of the blocks are happening.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a way that ensures the correct comparison between them. We should include the index in the tuple used for sorting to ensure a proper order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), tuple(block.index))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `equals` function now includes the index in the sorting tuple to ensure a proper order when comparing blocks. This should address the bug and make the comparison more robust, ensuring that the function passes the failing test.
