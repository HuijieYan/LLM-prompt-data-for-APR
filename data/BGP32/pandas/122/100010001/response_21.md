### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `Managers` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.
- The specific error message `E       assert True is False` suggests that the expected output of `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but it is evaluating to `True` instead.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue likely lies in how the equality comparison of the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is implemented in the `equals` method.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is related to how the method canonicalizes block order for comparison. The bug is not handling the case where the data types of columns are different between `self` and `other` data frames.
- This leads to the comparison failing where it should have passed because the order of data blocks is not canonically matched due to differing data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function used to order the blocks for comparison also considers the data type of the block along with the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
- By adding the data type of the block to the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function, we can ensure that blocks are correctly ordered for comparison regardless of data type mismatches.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Add `block.dtypes` to the canonicalize tuple
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above correction, the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using `equals` method should now return `False` as expected and pass the test without raising the assertion error.
