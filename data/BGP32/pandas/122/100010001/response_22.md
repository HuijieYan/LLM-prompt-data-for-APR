### Analysis:
The error message states that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. The output of the assertion indicates that `True` is being compared to `False`, leading to the failure. This is likely due to the implementation of the `equals` method in the function provided above. The comparison logic within the `equals` method is flawed, causing the incorrect comparison result.

### Bug:
The bug lies within the `equals` method where it checks for equality between two DataFrames. The issue arises because the method sorting the blocks and comparing them may lead to inequivalence even if the DataFrames are equivalent due to different block orders.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, an alternative approach is needed to check for DataFrame equality. Sorting blocks and comparing them might not be the most robust approach to ensure equivalence. Instead, we can directly compare the values of the DataFrames element-wise.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare shapes
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    # Compare values element-wise
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected version directly compares the values of the DataFrames element-wise, ensuring equivalence regardless of block order.
