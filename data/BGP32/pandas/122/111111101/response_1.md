The bug in the provided `equals` function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function tries to compare if the blocks from `self` and `other` are equal by sorting them based on a custom `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute should not be directly compared as a list due to potential inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the types directly and handle `mgr_locs` appropriately. We can convert `mgr_locs` to a tuple before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their data types without considering `mgr_locs`, thereby passing the failing test case provided.
