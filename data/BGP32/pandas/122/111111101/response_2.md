### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks when determining equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison of the blocks is being done based on their data type and manager locations, but due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, the order of block comparison is not being maintained correctly. This leads to the incorrect determination of equality between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in the correct order while checking for equality between the two `BlockManager` instances. One way to achieve this is by directly iterating over the blocks without sorting them beforehand, as the order of blocks should be preserved in the comparison process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared in the correct order and should now pass the failing test case.
