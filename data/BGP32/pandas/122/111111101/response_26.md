### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, sorting their blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, and finally comparing the blocks themselves. The failing test is due to a mismatch in the expected and actual data within the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on a custom key `canonicalize`, which boils down to comparing the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. However, the `dtype` is not a direct attribute of the block object, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the dtype of the block. We can get the dtype by accessing the `values` attribute of the block, which contains the underlying NumPy array. After extracting the dtype, we can compare it along with `mgr_locs` to ensure proper comparison of blocks.

### Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Extract dtype of the block for comparison
        block_dtype = getattr(block.values, 'dtype', None)
        return (block_dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this change, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function should now correctly handle the dtype comparison and address the bug. After applying this fix, the failing test case should pass successfully.
