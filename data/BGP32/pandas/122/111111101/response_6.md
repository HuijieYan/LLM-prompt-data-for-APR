The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The function fails to correctly compare blocks due to the inconsistent ordering of the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks contained in `self` and `other` are sorted consistently before comparison based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. This will align the block comparison and resolve the inconsistency issue, allowing the function to pass the failing test case.
