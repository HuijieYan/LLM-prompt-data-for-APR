### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where the order of blocks may not be consistent due to how they are sorted based on type name and `mgr_locs`. This inconsistent order leads to false negatives in the comparison, causing the `equals` function to return `False` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner before comparison. One approach is to sort the blocks by type and then by the order of `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in a consistent order, ensuring that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass successfully.
