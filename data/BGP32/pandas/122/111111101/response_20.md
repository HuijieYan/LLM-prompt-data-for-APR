### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager`. The issue lies in how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality. The buggy function sorts the blocks by a tuple of dtype name and `mgr_locs`. While this approach is meant to handle unconsolidated blocks like Categorical, the comparison step fails to correctly determine equality between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To correct the bug, we need to modify the sorting and comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on the tuple of dtype name and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the blocks directly based on their content. By iterating over the blocks and comparing each block between `self` and `other`, we can accurately determine their equality.

### Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.index)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.index)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected function now properly compares the blocks based on their content and ensures that the comparison is reliable for determining equality between `BlockManager` instances.
