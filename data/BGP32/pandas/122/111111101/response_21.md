### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to sort these blocks based on the block type name and `mgr_locs` attribute, but it fails to properly process `mgr_locs`.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily localized to the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method, specifically where it attempts to call `.as_array.tolist()` on `block.mgr_locs`. The error lies in how mgr_locs is being handled during sorting, causing mismatched comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way `mgr_locs` is processed in the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper sorting based on the type name and location attribute.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining the type name and mgr_locs for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected code addresses the issue by properly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, allowing for correct sorting based on both the type name and the location attribute.
