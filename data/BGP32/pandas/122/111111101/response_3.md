### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in a non-canonical order. The function compares blocks between two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` by sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, the sorting logic and comparison of blocks are incorrect, leading to the failing test case.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect sorting logic for blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple of dtype name and manager locations. This sorting may not guarantee the correct order of blocks and leads to a faulty comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing them. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks based on the actual data they contain rather than just the dtype name and manager locations. By comparing the actual data within the blocks, we can ensure a correct comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure blocks are sorted by actual data content
    def get_block_data(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_data)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their actual data values, ensuring a proper comparison between the `BlockManager` objects.
