### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. These blocks are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function that uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `BlockPlacement` object does not have the attribute `as_array`, causing an AttributeError when attempting to access it in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the block is of type `BlockPlacement` in the `canonicalize` function. We can update the `canonicalize` function to check for this case and appropriately handle it.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'dtype'):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return block

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will handle the `BlockPlacement` object gracefully and avoid the AttributeError, allowing the comparison to proceed as intended.
