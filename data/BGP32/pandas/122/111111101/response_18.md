### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison logic relies on sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes. 

However, the bug occurs because the `block` object is not correctly retrieved within the `canonicalize` function. The line `return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` provided for canonicalizing the blocks is attempting to access the `block` directly, but it is missing an iteration through the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` tuples. This causes an error because `block` is not defined within the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we access the `block` object within the `canonicalize` function. We should iterate through both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to retrieve the `block` objects correctly for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now properly compare the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, fixing the bug and allowing it to pass the failing test.
