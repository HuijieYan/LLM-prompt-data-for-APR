### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the order of the blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to properly compare the blocks contained in the `BlockManager` objects due to incorrect sorting of the blocks based on their type and location. This results in the `equals` function returning `True` incorrectly, leading to the failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the blocks' order is consistent and properly compared between the two `BlockManager` instances. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their type and location before comparing them. By doing so, we can ensure a correct comparison and return the appropriate boolean value based on the equality of the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the equals Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug and ensures correct block comparison:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances and return the expected boolean value, passing the failing test case.
