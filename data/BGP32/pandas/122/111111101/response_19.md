### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes, consolidating the blocks within each instance, and then comparing each block of one instance with the corresponding block of the other instance.

The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is done by sorting the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs`. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not accessible directly through the block object, leading to a `AttributeError` when trying to access `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute can be accessed correctly within the `Block` class instances. One approach to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to directly access the `mgr_locs` attribute from the block object. Additionally, we need to make sure that the sorting criteria used in the `canonicalize` function correctly represent the properties of the blocks for effective comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.items), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `block.dtype`, `block.items`, and `block.values` to generate the sorting key. This should allow for proper sorting and comparison of the blocks when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` instances. With this correction, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test case.
