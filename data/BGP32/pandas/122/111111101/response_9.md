The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to how it compares two instances of `BlockManager`. The equality check involves comparing axes, consolidating the blocks in-place, and then comparing the blocks themselves.

Based on the provided buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the comparison of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method is flawed. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple consisting of a block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` as an array. However, the way it accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute is incorrect, leading to a failure in the comparison.

To fix this bug, the correct way to access the `mgr_locs` attribute of a block is by calling the `as_array` method directly. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the dtypes of the blocks are different during the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now properly compare the blocks within two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test provided.
