### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the comparison logic between the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The bug incorrectly compares the blocks within the BlockManagers without taking into account the block ordering. This leads to a wrong determination of equality, causing the failing test case where two DataFrames are expected to be unequal, but the function returns True.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between `self` and `other` BlockManagers accounts for the block order by sorting the blocks based on a canonicalized key. By sorting the blocks before comparison, we can guarantee that the blocks are compared correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the sorting of blocks based on the canonicalized key before the comparison loop, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for comparing two BlockManagers.
