### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function checks the axes of the two instances, then consolidates both instances in place and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both instances and compares them element-wise for equality.

The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The comparison logic used in the function does not correctly handle the comparison between blocks that have the same content but are in different orders. When blocks need to be compared, they should be compared based on their content, not necessarily based on their ordering or memory locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to update the comparison logic for blocks. Instead of relying on sorting blocks based on dtype name and memory locations, we should compare the blocks based on their content. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on their values rather than dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a hash of the block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on a hash of their content, we ensure that blocks with the same content but different orders are treated as equal. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
